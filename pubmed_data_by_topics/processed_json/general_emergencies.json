    "title": "Utilizing POCUS in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction and the barriers to its implementation in resource-limited settings: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency that can lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, particularly when diagnosis is delayed. In rural and resource-limited emergency settings, advanced imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) may not be readily available. As a result, clinicians often rely on physical examinations and plain radiographs which can be unreliable. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) provides a rapid, radiation-free and cost-effective diagnostic alternative that can be performed directly at the bedside. We conducted a systematic review of published literature evaluating the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of POCUS in identifying SBO on the following databases PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases from January 2000 to December 2024. Studies were screened and selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria adhering to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The sensitivity of POCUS for SBO ranged from 85.0 to 100%, while specificity ranged from 54.0 to 100%. Diagnostic accuracy remained high across a broad range of expertise overcoming operator dependence. Examination durations are approximately 10-11 min, which is markedly shorter than 45-min to 3-h by CT. POCUS presents as a practical, scalable and cost-saving tool for diagnosing SBO in rural emergency care, addressing significant gaps where CT is not available and also facilitates faster diagnosis by timely identification of specific features. Future efforts should focus on developing validated algorithms for resource-limited settings allowing immediate care management."

    "title": "Left-sided perforated appendicitis in a 22-year-female with intestinal malrotation: A case report from a resource-limited setting.",
    "abstract": "A left-sided appendicitis is rare and usually caused by congenital anomalies such as intestinal malrotation or situs inversus. Diagnosis can be particularly challenging in low-resource settings where imaging such as CT is unavailable. A 22-year-old female presented with periumbilical pain that migrated to left iliac fossa area over five days. Due to the lack of CT imaging, clinical evaluation led to a diagnosis of acute abdomen. Emergency laparotomy revealed a perforated appendix located in the left lower quadrant due to intestinal malrotation. Appendectomy was performed, and the patient recovered uneventfully. Her last menstrual period was one week before admission, and gynecologic causes were considered in the differential diagnosis but excluded intraoperatively. As a result of this case, appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of left-sided abdominal pain. The intraoperative recognition of malrotation emphasizes the importance of surgical awareness of anatomical variations, particularly when preoperative imaging is lacking. The diagnosis of left-sided perforated appendicitis is rare, but should be considered in patients with atypical abdominal pain. In resource-limited environments, clinical judgment and timely surgical exploration are essential."

    "title": "Local soft tissue dissemination of large joint septic arthritis: A report of two cases.",
    "abstract": "Septic arthritis (SA) is a surgical emergency that can result in joint destruction and systemic sepsis. Local soft tissue dissemination of native joint SA leading to necrotising fasciitis (NF) is a rare but devastating complication associated with poorer outcomes. We present two adult patients with poorly controlled diabetes who developed SA complicated by NF-one affecting the knee and posterior leg, the other the shoulder and anterior arm. Both required multiple joint washouts, serial wound debridements, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. One patient sustained extensive soft tissue loss necessitating coverage with a biodegradable temporising matrix (BTM) followed by split-thickness skin grafting. These cases highlight the clinical course of this rare but severe complication and emphasise the importance of early diagnosis, initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and timely surgical intervention. We also outline a practical diagnostic and management framework, including antimicrobial selection post-arthrocentesis, the role of pre-operative imaging, and the rationale for selecting arthroscopic versus open joint debridement. SA complicated by NF is a life- and limb-threatening condition that presents numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and a multidisciplinary approach incorporating empirical antibiotics, targeted imaging, and prompt surgical management are essential to optimise outcomes."

    "title": "Chronic HIV infection complicated by pancreatitis, pancreatic tail pseudocyst and atraumatic splenic rupture: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Acute pancreatitis is an uncommon but clinically important complication in people living with HIV (PLWH) and has been linked to HIV itself, older nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors via hypertriglyceridemia, and multiple opportunistic or metabolic comorbidities. Atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is rare and has been described in association with acute or chronic pancreatitis and, more rarely, with HIV infection. However, the coexistence of chronic HIV infection, pancreatitis with pancreatic tail pseudocyst, and ASR has seldom been reported. We present a complex case highlighting the interaction between long-standing HIV infection, chronic pancreatitis, and splenic injury. To our knowledge, no previous report has described chronic HIV infection complicated simultaneously by acute-on-chronic pancreatitis, a pancreatic tail pseudocyst, and atraumatic splenic rupture. A 35-year-old man with a 9-year history of HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with acute worsening of upper abdominal pain and dizziness on the background of intermittent epigastric pain over one year. He had no history of abdominal trauma, alcohol abuse, gallstones, or hypertriglyceridemia, and had never received didanosine or stavudine. Initial assessment revealed pallor, hypotension, generalized abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs, severe anemia, leukocytosis, and markedly elevated serum amylase and lipase levels. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed hemoperitoneum, irregular laceration and heterogeneous enhancement of the spleen, chronic pancreatitis with atrophic, calcified pancreas and dilated main pancreatic duct, and a pseudocyst in the pancreatic tail abutting the splenic hilum. Emergency laparotomy revealed approximately 1500 mL of hemoperitoneum, a ruptured upper pole splenic laceration extending towards the hilum, and a pancreatic tail pseudocyst adherent to the splenic hilum. Splenectomy plus distal pancreatectomy with drainage were performed. Pathology confirmed chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation and splenic rupture without malignancy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful apart from reactive thrombocytosis, which was managed with antiplatelet therapy. The patient remained well with no recurrence of pancreatitis or splenic complications at 15-month follow-up. This case illustrates a plausible \"pancreas-spleen axis\" in which chronic pancreatitis with a pancreatic tail pseudocyst leads to local vascular and parenchymal fragility, predisposing to ASR in a patient with chronic HIV infection and incomplete immune reconstitution. It emphasizes the need to consider ASR in PLWH presenting with acute abdomen, particularly when imaging shows pancreatic tail pathology. Early CT, prompt surgical decision-making, and multidisciplinary management between infectious disease specialists and surgeons are critical for favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "We present a case of an 18-month-old female child who attended the paediatric emergency department with mild dehydration, pyrexia and a healing chickenpox (varicella) rash. Her older brother recently recovered from chickenpox without complication and is believed to have been the source of her infection. Her classically self-limiting condition was initially treated supportively with oral fluids and benzydamine mouth spray, before two further presentations to the emergency department with worsening clinical deterioration, a protracted pyrexia and an exquisitely painful right shoulder prompted the search for an alternative diagnosis. This ordinarily fit and well, immunocompetent girl was subsequently diagnosed with septic arthritis of the right shoulder, complicated by concurrent varicella zoster virus infection. She was managed operatively with needle arthrocentesis, using a two-cannula technique to thoroughly wash out the infected glenohumeral joint. An intra-operative pus sample was sent for culture, subsequently growing Group A streptococcus pyogenes. Following washout, she received a course of intravenous antibiotics. There was immediate clinical recovery in the function of the right shoulder joint which continued into the post-operative period. Down-trending infection markers demonstrated a biochemical improvement, and she was discharged from hospital with a three-week course of oral antibiotics, making a full recovery. The rarity of upper limb involvement, along with the operative management technique of two needle arthrocentesis joint washout make this case an important contribution to the existing knowledge base and highlights the importance of considering this surgical emergency presenting in - what is usually - an overwhelmingly benign and self-limiting illness."

    "abstract": "Open globe injury is a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis to minimize morbidity. Orbital CT is frequently performed in trauma settings and is crucial for globe evaluation, particularly when bedside assessment is limited. The primary objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of overall CT impression for detecting open globe injury. The secondary objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CT imaging signs. A systematic review protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42025638703). On January 16, 2025, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched without date restrictions. Diagnostic accuracy meta-analyses were performed on overall CT impression and individual CT imaging signs for open globe injury. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Eight studies met inclusion criteria representing 827 patients, 830 injured globes, and 339 confirmed open globe injury. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of overall CT impression was 75% (95% CI, 0.69-0.79) and 94% (95% CI, 0.91-0.96), respectively. Among individual signs, change in globe contour or scleral irregularity had the highest diagnostic odds ratio (109; 95% CI, 17-718) with sensitivity and specificity of 71% (95% CI, 0.61-0.79) and 98% (95% CI, 0.86-1.00), respectively. Change in anterior chamber depth, vitreous hemorrhage, lens abnormality, and intraocular air were insensitive but highly specific signs. Overall CT impression and individual imaging signs demonstrate high specificity but limited sensitivity for open globe injury. Surgical exploration remains necessary when clinical suspicion persists despite inconclusive imaging."

    "title": "Minimally Invasive Surgical Techniques in the Treatment of Appendicitis: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide, conventionally managed through open appendectomy until the advent of minimally invasive techniques. This narrative review gathers current evidence on minimally invasive surgical approaches for appendicitis, such as laparoscopic, single-incision, robotic, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, and endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy, accessibility, and challenges of these techniques while addressing barriers to global implementation and strategies for optimization. Laparoscopic appendectomy is considered the gold standard, offering shorter hospital stays, reduced postoperative pain, and fewer surgical site infections compared to open surgery. Innovations such as single-incision laparoscopy and endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy show promise in enhancing cosmetic outcomes and organ preservation but encounter limitations because of technical complexity, costs, and infrastructural requirements, particularly in low-resource settings. Robotic-assisted appendectomy shows better ergonomics and recovery benefits but remains cost-prohibitive for global use. In special populations, like pediatric patients and pregnant women, tailored approaches enhance safety and outcomes. However, significant disparities remain in global access to minimally invasive techniques, caused by economic constraints and training gaps in low- and middle-income countries. In clinical practice, laparoscopic appendectomy is advised where expertise exists, with technique selection guided by patient-specific factors like age, pregnancy, and appendicitis severity. Future efforts must prioritize standardized training, funded equipment, diagnostic algorithms to reduce unnecessary surgeries, and rigorous validation of emerging therapies. Collaborative policy and research initiatives are essential to bridge global differences and achieve evidence-based, minimally invasive management of appendicitis in all populations."

    "title": "Atypical Appendicitis Mimicking Gynecological Pathology: A Diagnostic Challenge in a Middle-Aged Woman.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but the diagnosis may remain unclear and challenging, particularly in middle-aged women who present with atypical features. Atypical appendicitis, defined as appendiceal inflammation without classic migratory pain, nausea, or fever; it often mimics gynecological disorders, contributing to diagnostic delays. The present case is unique because it involved an unusually prolonged 2-month history of persistent suprapubic pain before acute exacerbation. Such a chronic course preceding the acute phase is uncommon and further complicated the diagnostic process, underscoring the need for clinical vigilance in prolonged, unexplained lower abdominal pain. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old woman presented with a 2-month history of persistent suprapubic pain without associated systemic symptoms. Her gynecological history included prolonged intrauterine copper device use and recent postcoital bleeding. Initial clinical evaluation suggested pelvic inflammatory disease, and empirical antibiotics provided minimal symptomatic relief. Laboratory investigations and imaging, including pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography, were inconclusive, demonstrating bilateral simple ovarian cysts and a minimally distended appendix with mild periappendiceal fat stranding. Due to worsening localized right lower abdominal pain and persistent symptoms, laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed early acute appendicitis. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the need to maintain high clinical suspicion for appendicitis despite normal white blood cell counts and equivocal imaging, thereby supporting re-evaluation protocols for persistent abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is a common indication to surgery in paediatric emergency departments. Appendicitis is the most frequent diagnosis, followed by bowel obstruction and female genital conditions. Some rare aetiologies may lead to challenges in surgical management. Aim of this study is to analyse the distribution of rare causes of acute abdomen in patients undergoing emergency surgery in the past five years at our centre. Records of patients undergone urgent abdominal surgery were retrospectively reviewed from 2015 to 2019. Information relative to age, sex, underlying pathology, and surgery was recorded. The inclusion criteria were age <18 years and undergoing abdominal surgery. Neonates were excluded. The study population consisted of 957 patients. Median age was 9.7 years. Surgical procedure was laparoscopic in 22%, open in 78%. Common diagnoses were appendicitis in 815 patients, bowel obstruction in 72, adnexal and gynaecological pathology in 43, trauma in 9, complicated Meckel's diverticulum in 8. Rare findings included omental pathology (2), endometriosis (2), ectopic pregnancy (1), intestinal duplication (1), internal hernia (1), Amyand's hernia (1), epiploic appendix torsion (1), accessory spleen torsion (1). The aetiologies of acute abdomen in children vary depending on the age. Appendicitis is the most common surgical cause of acute abdomen, followed by other causes. Differential diagnosis, including rare pathologies, is required to predict the right surgical approach and to apply the proper treatment. Imaging techniques sometimes still result too invasive or insufficient, whereas the widespread use of laparoscopy may render surgical exploration acceptable in selected cases."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous hemoperitoneum caused by a uterine leiomyoma is an exceptionally rare but potentially life-threatening condition. We report the case of a 40-year-old woman who presented with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain and hemorrhagic shock. Focused sonography revealed massive hemoperitoneum, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated intra-abdominal bleeding associated with a large uterine mass. Emergency laparotomy revealed a large pedunculated leiomyoma with rupture of a superficial vessel on its surface, without evidence of torsion. Approximately 2,250 mL of blood was lost, and myomectomy was performed because the fibroid could be rapidly and safely excised by transecting the stalk, and the patient wished to preserve fertility. The postoperative course was uneventful, and histopathology confirmed a benign leiomyoma. Rupture of superficial vessels overlying uterine fibroids is extremely uncommon but should be considered in women presenting with hemoperitoneum of unknown origin, especially those with large leiomyomas. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are essential to prevent severe morbidity or mortality. This case underscores the importance of including the vascular rupture of a leiomyoma in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen."

In this report, we present a 29-year-old female patient with three days of worsening right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination showed tenderness to palpation at the RLQ. Workup showed acute appendicitis with probable localized perforation and peri-appendiceal abscess, and CT-guided drainage was performed. The patient was discharged after four days. Seventeen days later, the patient returned to the ED with complaints of new right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain with nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. The ultrasound showed similar gallbladder findings with a positive sonographic Murphy's sign. A CT scan showed appendicitis and cholecystitis with gallstones and mild gallbladder wall thickening. The patient then had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy. This case report sheds new light on this rare and interesting surgical emergency."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but its parasitic causes are often overlooked, particularly in non-endemic regions. Schistosomiasis, which affects over 250 million people globally, can rarely lead to schistosomal appendicitis (SA). A 32-year-old Filipino woman presented with acute right iliac fossa pain, vomiting, and loose stools. Clinical and imaging findings were consistent with appendicitis, and she underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. Histopathological analysis revealed multiple calcified Schistosoma ova in the appendiceal wall, confirming SA. The patient recovered uneventfully and was referred to the Infectious Diseases department for further management. This case represents the third reported instance of SA in Qatar. SA is clinically and radiologically indistinguishable from typical appendicitis and is usually diagnosed retrospectively via histopathology. SA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of appendicitis in migrants from endemic regions. Routine histopathological examination of appendectomy specimens is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate postoperative care."

We report a 4-year-old male who presented with acute febrile illness, suprapubic abdominal pain, and dysuria, initially managed as cystitis. Despite treatment, he developed peritonitis; imaging revealed free subdiaphragmatic air. Exploratory laparotomy showed an ischemic ascending colon with a solitary perforation, necessitating right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis. Histopathology demonstrated nonspecific ileitis, typhlitis, and colitis complicated by cecal perforation, with no evidence of typhoid, tuberculosis, or inflammatory bowel disease. Postoperative recovery was uneventful following broad-spectrum antibiotics. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of spontaneous colonic perforation in children, where non-specific presentations may mimic urinary tract or infectious illnesses. Early recognition and timely surgical intervention are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, this represents one of the few pediatric reports of spontaneous ascending colon perforation in the absence of identifiable etiology."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is a common clinical emergency requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. Abdominal radiography (AR) remains a first-line imaging tool due to its accessibility and specificity for certain conditions, but minimizing radiation exposure is a persistent concern. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-dose abdominal radiography (LDAR) protocol for patients with acute abdomen. A total of 354 patients (189 men, 165 women; mean age, 50 years) who underwent acute abdominal surgery after being admitted with an acute abdomen were randomly assigned to a LDAR group [121 kVp, with automatic exposure control (AEC)] and a standard-dose abdominal radiography group (SDAR; 81 kVp, with AEC) group. Plain LDAR and SDAR were independently reviewed by two radiologists for the overimpression, diaphragm, and intestinal gas, and program analysis was performed in a delayed manner, with diaphragm sharpness computed by Matlab. The mean values of parameters assessed by the two radiologists were compared. All images, from both the LDAR group and the SDAR group, were appropriate for direct diagnosis. No patients were exposed to additional doses in this study. The imaging quality of plain LDAR was superior to that of the plain SDAR, with higher mean scores for overimpression (4.97±0.18 vs. 4.68±0.55; P<0.001), diaphragm (4.97±0.18 vs. 4.69±0.55; P<0.001), and lower diaphragm sharpness (1.27±0.35 vs. 1.90±0.48; P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the LDAR and SDAR groups based on the mean scores of intestinal gas (P=0.057). The radiation dose was significantly lowered by approximately 64% for entrance skin dose (ESD; 1.13±0.22 vs. 3.13±1.30, P<0.001) and effective dose (ED; 0.19±0.04 vs. 0.53±0.22, P<0.001) demonstrated in the LDAR group. The LDAR with 121 kVp could significantly reduce radiation dose while maintaining comparable image quality to that of SDAR, holding value in specific clinical scenarios.

    "abstract": "Background: Acute appendicitis, a frequent pediatric surgical emergency, requires distinguishing simple from complicated cases for treatment decisions. Current tools, such as clinical scores and ultrasound, are sometimes ineffective. This study evaluates the biomarkers: neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (NLR), monocytes to lymphocytes ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophils to monocytes ratio (NMR), neutrophils to platelet ratio (NPR), pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) ratio, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) to lymphocytes ratio (CLR) for differentiation between simple and complicated appendicitis. Methods: A retrospective study of 878 pediatric patients (<18 years) who underwent appendectomy (2018-2024) at a tertiary medical center, with appendicitis classified as simple (SA, n = 696) or complicated (CA, n = 182) using intraoperative findings. Biomarkers were calculated from preoperative blood counts and CRP. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using Mann-Whitney U tests, ROC curves, and logarithmic regression. Results: Patients with CA had higher neutrophils counts (13.61 ± 4.92 vs. 11.39 ± 4.29 K/μL), monocytes counts (1.23 ± 1.41 vs. 0.95 ± 0.48 K/μL), platelet counts (294.31 ± 72.73 vs. 270.15 ± 72.08 K/μL), CRP levels (88.55 ± 97.75 vs. 27.15 ± 44.74 mg/L), and elevated biomarker ratios as compared to those with SA: NLR (≥10.15, OR = 2.45), MLR (≥0.645, OR = 2.78), PLR (≥224.38, OR = 2.502), NMR (≥6.38, OR = 2.34), NPR (≥0.0405, OR = 1.876), PIV (≥2433.85, OR = 3.348), and CLR (≥11.77, OR = 5.935), all at p < 0.01. CLR demonstrated the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.772, sensitivity 78%, specificity 62.6%), outperforming established biomarkers, followed by PIV (AUC = 0.679). NPR was the least effective marker (AUC = 0.569). Conclusions: CLR, a promising biomarker, can aid in distinguishing complicated from simple appendicitis in children, and may offer accessible tools for resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This retrospective analysis aimed to identify key predictors for the need for surgery in SBO management and to develop a simple clinical risk score to support decision-making. Methods: This retrospective study included 285 patients treated for SBO at the University Hospital Erlangen from 2018 to 2022. Pretherapeutic clinical, laboratory, and imaging data, as well as treatment details and outcome parameters were assessed and analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify significant predictors for the need of surgery. A weighted point-based risk score was then derived from the final model, and its discriminative performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Of the 285 patients, 234 (82.1%) underwent surgery and 51 (17.9%) were successfully managed conservatively. Multivariate analysis identified the following independent predictors for surgery: 0-1 previous abdominal operation (OR 4.7, p = 0.009), serum albumin ≤ 34 g/L (OR 4.5, p = 0.011), free intraperitoneal fluid on imaging (OR 3.6, p = 0.015), air-fluid levels on plain abdominal X-ray (OR 3.5, p = 0.024) and a transition point on CT (OR 11.4, p = 0.002). A weighted score (range 0-6 points) was constructed, assigning 1 point to each of the first four predictors and 2 points to the transition point. The score showed good discrimination for predicting the need for surgery (AUC 0.874). Using a cut-off of ≥3 points, sensitivity was 96.2% and specificity 64.7%. The observed proportion of patients requiring surgery increased from 21.4% in the low-risk group (0-2 points) to 88.6% in the intermediate-risk group (3-4 points) and 97.3% in the high-risk group (5-6 points). Conclusions: The proposed predictors and the weighted risk score may support bedside decision-making in SBO by distinguishing patients who require surgery from those eligible for conservative management, but they require prospective multicenter validation before routine clinical implementation."

    "abstract": "Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but critical surgical emergency, with a global incidence of 1-3 cases per 100,000 annually. Despite its rarity, CES has paradoxically emerged as one of the most common referral diagnoses to tertiary spinal centres. This discrepancy between referral rates and the actual prevalence of CES raises concerns about potential over-referral and inefficiencies in clinical pathways. This study aimed to evaluate compliance with national guidelines from the British Association of Spine Surgeons (BASS) and Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) concerning the streamlined referral pathways and timely magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilisation for suspected CES at a major tertiary spinal centre in the UK. A retrospective audit was conducted on all urgent and emergency CES referrals (n=353) received by a tertiary spinal centre via an electronic referral system over a 15-week period (June-September 2023). Electronic patient records were retrospectively reviewed to assess compliance with national CES pathway standards, particularly the proportion of patients receiving MRI scans prior to referral and within 24 hours of symptom presentation. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS. Of the 353 urgent and emergency referrals, 102 (29%) were for suspected CES, but only 6 cases (1.7%) were confirmed and required surgical intervention. MRI scans were completed before referral in 48% of suspected CES cases, with 94% being within 24 hours of presenting with symptoms. Compliance rates significantly differed between daytime (72%) and out-of-hours referrals (31%). Despite clear national guidelines, adherence to recommended CES pathways remains suboptimal, particularly regarding timely MRI access and pre-referral imaging. Variations in guideline compliance, especially out-of-hours, highlight the need for improved access and workforce adjustments to optimise resource utilisation, reduce inappropriate referrals, and prioritise care for true CES patients."

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic hernias arise when a defect in the diaphragmatic musculotendinous framework allows the abnormal protrusion of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity, which can be further complicated by visceral incarceration, strangulation, and perforation. Whilst the vast majority occur congenitally or are acquired through trauma, diaphragmatic hernias arising from iatrogenic insults represent an exceedingly rare but important clinical entity. Diagnostic challenges arise in large part due to their tendency towards delayed presentation, often with varied, nonspecific and subacute clinical manifestations, as well as equivocal or indeterminate radiographic findings. The report herein represents the inaugural account of an iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia arising following thoracoscopic pleural endometriosis removal, which was subsequently complicated by gastric strangulation and perforation, culminating in a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. We describe a safe, effective approach to managing this surgical emergency using an entirely laparoscopic technique and relate our findings to the broader literature pertaining to complicated diaphragmatic hernias."

This study aims to evaluate and analyze the impact of MSCs on the healing process of duodenal perforation wounds. MSCs were extracted from the umbilical cords of rats and injected into the site of duodenal perforation at two different doses: 1.5 × 106 for Treatment Group 1 and 3 × 106 for Treatment Group 2. The control group consisted of rats with duodenal perforation that received local injections on normal saline. The levels of Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) and Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA) were assessed via Western Blot analysis, while collagen and fibroblast presence were evaluated through histopathological examination. These examinations were conducted on days 3 and 7 post-treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 25.0, with significance defined at p<0.05. Significant increases in the expression of TGF-β, fibroblasts, collagen, and α-SMA were observed in the treatment groups compared to the control group on both day 3 and day 7. The administration of MSCs significantly enhances the proliferation phase of duodenal wound healing through the increased expression of fibroblasts, collagen, TGF-β, and α-SMA."

    "title": "Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis Presenting as Acute Abdomen: A Rare Case Report.",
    "abstract": "ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of autoimmune diseases characterized by necrotizing inflammation and fibrinoid necrosis of small- and medium-sized blood vessels. Renal involvement is common in AAV; however, renal hemorrhage is extremely rare, particularly in cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Spontaneous renal hemorrhage often presents as acute abdomen. We report a 51-year-old male with a prior diagnosis of EGPA who presented to the emergency department with acute left-sided abdominal pain and signs of hypovolemic shock. Imaging revealed a massive left perirenal hematoma without active contrast extravasation, suggestive of renal rupture. Initial management focused on hemostasis and stabilization, but recurrent contralateral renal hemorrhage occurred during hospitalization. Further immunological, histopathological, and bone marrow evaluations confirmed EGPA complicated by renal involvement. The patient was treated with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab, but recurrent hemorrhage indicated rapid disease progression or insufficient therapeutic response. Due to financial constraints, the patient was discharged prematurely, precluding long-term follow-up. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing and managing AAV-associated renal hemorrhage, particularly in EGPA patients. While the renal vascular changes observed, such as inflammation and potential necrosis, may be linked to the underlying vasculitis in EGPA, causality should be interpreted with caution, as other factors like coagulopathy, concurrent infections, or iatrogenic effects could contribute. Current literature suggests that ANCA-associated mechanisms, including NETs formation, play a role in vascular damage, but direct causation in rare complications like renal hemorrhage remains uncertain and requires further investigation. While EGPA treatment primarily involves immunosuppressive therapy targeting vasculitis and eosinophilia, spontaneous renal hemorrhage requires an integrated approach, including conservative management, interventional embolization, or surgical exploration in life-threatening cases. Reports of AAV-associated renal hemorrhage are rare, and large-scale studies are lacking, necessitating further research to optimize treatment strategies."

    "title": "Chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy versus physical therapist-led exercise and the risk of cauda equina syndrome in adults with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, or radiculopathy.",
    "abstract": "Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency often caused by lumbar disc herniation. Spinal manipulative therapy is commonly used for lumbar spine disorders, but case reports have raised concerns it may precipitate cauda equina syndrome. One cohort study suggested no increased risk, although it did not focus on patients with lumbar spine disorders pertinent to cauda equina syndrome, such as disc herniation, stenosis, or radiculopathy/sciatica. To address this evidence gap, we tested the null hypothesis that there is no increased risk of cauda equina syndrome following spinal manipulative therapy among adults with these lumbar spine disorders compared to matched controls receiving physical therapist-led therapeutic exercise (PTE). Using a retrospective cohort design, we queried a U.S. research network (TriNetX) including patients aged ≥18 years with a lumbar spine disorder and excluding those with preexisting cauda equina syndrome, incontinence, serious spinal pathology, and recent spine surgery/injection. Data spanned 2005-2025. Patients were divided into cohorts: (1) spinal manipulative therapy administered by a chiropractor or (2) PTE without spinal manipulative therapy. Propensity score matching controlled for confounding variables. Outcomes included the risk ratio of cauda equina syndrome (primary), and bladder catheterization and bowel incontinence as additional cauda equina syndrome markers (secondary). After matching, there were 34,376 patients in each cohort. Comparing the spinal manipulative therapy cohort to PTE cohort, the incidence and risk of cauda equina syndrome did not significantly differ (risk ratio=0.88 [95% CI, 0.43-1.79]; p = .715). The risk of bladder catheterization (risk ratio = 0.50 [95% CI, 0.39- 0.64]; p < .001) and fecal incontinence (risk ratio = 0.50 [0.37, 0.68]; p < .001) was significantly lower in the spinal manipulative therapy cohort. Among adults with lumbar disc herniation, stenosis, and/or radiculopathy, we did not identify an association between spinal manipulative therapy and an increased risk of cauda equina syndrome."

    "abstract": "Acute Type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) remains a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality despite improvements in operative management. The influence of age on outcomes among patients undergoing surgical repair remains incompletely characterized. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2010-2018, 2020), we identified adult hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of ATAAD who underwent surgical repair. Patients were stratified into three age groups (<65, 66-75, and >75 years). Weighted analyses compared demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, and outcomes across groups. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of in-hospital mortality, adjusting for comorbidities and hospital factors. Among 32,798 weighted admissions, 48.1% were aged <65 years, 23.3% were 66-75 years, and 28.6% were >75 years (median age 65 years). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 11.9%, increasing from 8.9% in younger patients to 17.1% in those >75 years (p<0.001). Older adults had greater comorbidity burden (with most comorbidities differing significantly), shorter median length of stay (5 vs 6 days, p<0.001), and lower total hospital charges (p<0.001). On multivariable analysis, age remained an independent predictor of mortality in patients 66-75 years old (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.34-1.63; p<0.001) and in patients > 75 years (OR 2.29, 95% CI 2.10-2.5; p<0.001). Larger hospitals demonstrated modestly higher adjusted mortality, while hospital teaching status was not independently associated with outcomes. Advancing age substantially increases in-hospital mortality after ATAAD repair. These findings emphasize the need for individualized operative decision-making, early referral to experienced centers, and system-level strategies to optimize outcomes for older adults with ATAAD."

    "abstract": "Omental torsion (OT) is a rare cause of acute abdomen, it can be difficult to diagnose preoperatively and is frequently misdiagnosed. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality for OT. It typically shows the swirl sign. contrast-enhanced CT can better visualize the central vascular structure of the mass, thus improving the diagnostic accuracy for OT. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for OT. Laparoscopy allows direct visualization of the primary torsion site and comprehensive abdominal exploration, thereby decreasing misdiagnoses. It is a safe and reliable approach for OT treatment, which offers the advantages of minimal trauma, mild postoperative pain, and rapid recovery for stylistic precision. A 48-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to lower right abdominal pain for the preceding 70 hours. Physical examination revealed lower right abdominal muscle strain, tenderness, and rebound pain, but no mass was palpable. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a thickened, blurred omentum with swirling changes in the right abdomen. Laparoscopic exploration and omentectomy were performed in the emergency setting. The procedure revealed 50 mL of dark-red bloody ascites in the pelvis and twisting of the right omentum along its longitudinal axis, with a 10 cm × 8 cm purple-black necrosis at the distal end. Post-surgical pathology revealed omental hemorrhage, degeneration, and necrosis. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. During the subsequent nine-month follow-up, he remained asymptomatic. OT is a rare disease that lacks specific clinical manifestations. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT plays a crucial role in diagnosing OT, and laparoscopic surgery is a safe and effective diagnostic and therapeutic approach."

    "title": "Investigating the Benefit of Fluorescence in Acute Mesenteric Ischaemia: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis.",
    "abstract": "Acute Mesenteric Ischaemia (AMI) is a life-threatening surgical emergency, with a high mortality rate. Timely revascularisation is crucial to avoid bowel necrosis; however, once tissue becomes non-viable, surgical resection is necessary. Delineating viability is a critical challenge. Indocyanine Green (ICG) fluorescence, used to visualise tissue perfusion in elective resections, could be used to assess bowel perfusion in the emergency setting. This narrative synthesis aims to evaluate the benefit of intraoperative ICG in the context of AMI. A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted according to a predefined protocol (PROSPERO ID: 42024581088). The following electronic databases were interrogated between January 1st 1945 and 1st May 2024: EMBASE and Medline (via OVID). All studies that investigated the use of ICG in the management of AMI were considered. The search returned 2941 articles. 84 abstracts were reviewed leaving 6 articles with a total of 196 patients for full assessment and which were included in the final narrative synthesis. Macroscopic perfusion assessment was inconsistent with ICG in 35% of cases, with ICG proposing more conservative resection in 75%. No statistically significant difference in re-look rates, morbidity or mortality was found when comparing ICG to visual assessment alone. ICG may reduce length of bowel resection and both planned and unplanned re-look laparotomies. Outcomes reporting is sparse and comparative studies lacking. Randomised studies comparing ICG against direct light are needed. Improved intraoperative decision-making using ICG could optimise resection boundaries, enhance patient outcomes and reduce mortality in this critical population."

    "title": "Twisted Mystery: Identifying Gallbladder Volvulus: Challenges in Preoperative Diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Gallbladder volvulus (GV) is a rare surgical emergency caused by the twisting of the gallbladder on its mesentery, leading to vascular compromise and potential necrosis. It primarily affects elderly women but can occur at any age or in either sex. Excessive gallbladder mobility is a key predisposing factor, and the condition often mimics acute cholecystitis, making early diagnosis challenging. Timely recognition is crucial to prevent severe complications. Given its rarity and frequent diagnostic uncertainty, each reported case provides valuable insight, and the present report contributes to the existing literature and serves as a practical example of how such uncommon conditions can be recognized and managed. CASE REPORT We report a case of an 85-year-old women with no significant medical history who presented with a 2-day history of severe right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. Initial imaging (ultrasound and CT) was indicative but not typical of acute acalculous cholecystitis. Other differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out. Further review of the ultrasound and CT scans by a specialist radiologist raised suspicion of GV through some radiological pathognomonic signs (eg, the whirl sign). Laparoscopic view revealed a 360° gallbladder torsion, confirming the diagnosis of GV. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed without complications, and the patient had an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of considering GV in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in elderly patients. Increased awareness, a comprehensive clinical assessment, and advancements in radiological diagnostics are essential for early diagnosis and timely intervention."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis represents a prevalent surgical emergency globally, posing a significant risk of severe complications. These complications encompass a spectrum of conditions, including ileus, peritonitis, abscess formation, and, in extreme cases, mortality. The present study aims to assess the association of existing risk scores for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and patient characteristics with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, the odds of operative vs non-operative management, and postoperative outcomes. In total, 109 patients assessed for acute appendicitis were included in this study. Sex (p = 0.99, OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87-1.17) and age (p = 0.23, OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.98-1.04) were not found to be significantly associated with the diagnosis of appendicitis. Patients with radiating pain were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with appendicitis compared to those with localized pain (p = 4.05 × 10-6, RR = 0.0918, 95% CI: 0.039-0.217). The duration of symptoms did not significantly influence the diagnosis (p = 0.12, RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.98-1.11). Increased ALVARADO scores were significantly associated with operative treatment, with patients receiving an appendicectomy having a mean score of 7.56 (SD 1.91) and patients undergoing conservative management having a mean score of 4.92 (SD 1.56) (p-value < 0.001). The results of this study highlight the importance of clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and specific laboratory markers in the diagnosis of appendicitis. While demographic factors and certain biomarkers did not show significant associations, the combination of clinical and laboratory data can aid in accurate diagnosis and timely intervention."

    "abstract": "Vaginal cuff dehiscence (VCD) with bowel evisceration is a rare but serious post-operative complication following hysterectomy, particularly associated with minimally invasive surgical approaches. It carries significant morbidity and requires prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. We report the case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with post-coital acute lower abdominal pain and evisceration of bowel through the vagina 3 months after undergoing a total laparoscopic hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding. On examination, large loops of small bowel were noted to be eviscerated through the vaginal canal, with pieces of tissue paper adhered to the eviscerated bowel. Emergent surgical exploration was performed, revealing a dehisced vaginal cuff with underlying viable bowel. The bowel was reduced, the vaginal cuff was repaired transvaginally, and an exploratory laparoscopy was performed with the remaining adherent tissue paper being left on the bowel. The patient recovered without complication and was discharged after a 3-day hospital stay. VCD with evisceration is a rare complication that requires high clinical suspicion, particularly in posthysterectomy patients presenting with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding or protrusion. Timely surgical management is essential to avoid bowel ischaemia and other complications. Awareness of risk factors and careful surgical technique during cuff closure at the time of hysterectomy may help prevent this potentially life-threatening condition. This case also highlights the unique and novel occurrence of tissue paper being left intra-abdominally at the time of surgery in support of potential conservative management in these instances."

    "abstract": "Congenital transmesenteric hernia, an uncommon cause of acute abdomen with an incidence of less than 1%, is often identified only intraoperatively.We present a rare case of internal hernia through a congenital mesenteric defect posterior to the gastric antrum, precipitated by strenuous exercise after a meal in an adolescent. A 17-year-old male developed sudden severe abdominal pain and distension after vigorous exercise following a meal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an abnormally displaced duodenal loop, raising suspicion for internal herniation. Laparoscopic exploration revealed that a large segment of the small bowel had herniated through a congenital mesenteric defect posterior to the gastric antrum into the right upper abdomen. The herniated bowel exhibited clockwise torsion, forming a closed-loop obstruction with strangulated necrosis. Due to extensive necrosis and limited working space, the procedure was converted to an open laparotomy for definitive resection. Following resection of the necrotic bowel, only 6 cm of terminal ileum remained. To preserve the ileocecal valve function, after the viability of both ends was confirmed and with informed consent from the patient's guardians, an ileo-ileal side-to-side anastomosis was performed to restore intestinal continuity. By postoperative day 7, pelvic drainage was clear, without evidence of anastomotic leakage, and the patient had a smooth recovery and was subsequently discharged. Emergency physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for transmesenteric hernia as a potential cause of acute strangulation and bowel necrosis in patients presenting with acute abdomen, and timely surgical intervention is essential. Although long-term outcomes require further evaluation, ileal resection near the ileocecal region with preservation of the valve using a side-to-side anastomosis may represent a salvage strategy under high-risk anatomical conditions."

In patients with cirrhosis, the frequency of PVT increases with the severity of cirrhosis. The main symptoms of recent PVT include abdominal pain and an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP). The main symptoms of chronic PVT are manifestations of portal hypertension (esophageal varices, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly). The diagnosis of PVT is fortuitous in 30% of cases. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with acquisitions without injection, at the arterial, portal, and tardive phase are mandatory to confirm the diagnosis and assess complications. Mesenteric ischemia is a medical and surgical emergency and represents the most severe complication of PVT. It must be systematically investigated using imaging. Surgery should be considered when intestinal necrosis is suspected, namely in cases of hyperlactatemia and associated organ failure. Anticoagulant therapy is the first-line treatment of recent and chronic PVT. Its modalities are based on a case-by-case assessment, considering features of thrombosis, comorbidities, and the therapeutic plan. In case of failure of anticoagulant therapy and/or severe manifestations, radiological portal vein recanalization may be considered. Treatment in a center with expertise in vascular liver diseases is recommended.

    "abstract": "The global population is aging rapidly, leading to a significant increase in geriatric patients requiring emergency surgical intervention. This demographic presents unique challenges due to high frailty, multisystem comorbidities, and atypical disease presentations, which contribute to elevated surgical risks and poorer outcomes compared to younger populations. This review aims to synthesize the current research landscape regarding emergency general surgical conditions in older adults. It focuses on the common disease spectrum, evolving management strategies, and critical prognostic determinants to inform and enhance evidence-based clinical practice. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to delineate the etiology of acute abdomen in the elderly, evaluate the utility of preoperative assessment tools and surgical approaches, and identify key factors influencing patient outcomes, including mortality and complication rates. Acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, and biliary diseases represent the most prevalent conditions. Precise preoperative risk stratification using scoring systems like POSSUM is crucial. For hemodynamically stable patients, a laparoscopic-first approach is associated with reduced complications and shorter hospital stays. Prognosis is critically influenced not just by age, but more significantly by frailty, multimorbidity, and psychosocial factors. The integration of Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) models and rehabilitation medicine principles is pivotal for optimizing comprehensive care. The management of geriatric emergency surgical patients necessitates a tailored, multidimensional strategy. Future efforts to improve outcomes should focus on refined preoperative optimization, the promotion of minimally invasive techniques, and the systematic implementation of multidisciplinary collaboration and early rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous neonatal gastric perforation (SNGP) is an extremely rare but life-threatening surgical emergency. Open surgery has been the traditional mainstay of treatment, whereas reports on laparoscopic repair in neonates remain scarce. This report delineates a successful case of laparoscopic repair for SNGP in a newborn. We herein detail the surgical technique and elucidate the advantages of this minimally invasive approach over conventional open surgery. A 34-week premature male neonate, with a birth weight of 2550 grams and born to a G6P4 mother, was admitted presenting with a one-day history of vomiting and abdominal distension. An abdominal x-ray obtained at a referring hospital demonstrated pneumoperitoneum, suggestive of neonatal gastrointestinal perforation. Upon transfer to our institution, a repeat abdominal x-ray revealed massive subdiaphragmatic free air, elevated diaphragmatic arches, and central clustering of bowel loops, constituting the classic \"football sign.\" A preliminary diagnosis of spontaneous neonatal gastric perforation was established. The patient subsequently underwent emergent laparoscopic repair of the gastric perforation. Postoperatively, he was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for close monitoring. Full enteral feeding was gradually reestablished, commencing on the seventh postoperative day. In this case, a newborn with SNGP was successfully managed via laparoscopic repair. This case underscores the potential of minimally invasive techniques for managing this condition. The laparoscopic approach provided superior visualization of the gastric fundus and facilitated enhanced vessel mobilization compared to open surgery. The patient's uneventful postoperative recovery exemplifies the documented advantages of laparoscopy, including reduced tissue trauma, diminished postoperative pain, and a more rapid recovery. We therefore conclude that, for hemodynamically stable neonates in centers with appropriate surgical expertise, laparoscopic repair represents a viable and advantageous alternative to open surgery."

Renal involvement, most frequently distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), may present with severe metabolic disturbances. Rhabdomyolysis due to hypokalemia and systemic vasculitis are uncommon but potentially life-threatening complications. We report a 36-year-old woman who presented with fever, profuse diarrhea, progressive proximal muscle weakness, and a 10-kg weight loss. Laboratory evaluation revealed profound hypokalemia, hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis consistent with dRTA, and rhabdomyolysis with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) of 42,000 U/L. Electromyoneurography (EMNG) confirmed inflammatory myopathy, while autoimmune serology was positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Ro52, anti-SSA, and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) with marked hypocomplementemia. Despite supportive therapy, she developed an acute abdomen. Emergency laparotomy revealed perforated ischemic colitis and gangrenous cholecystitis. Histopathology confirmed necrotizing vasculitis of small- and medium-sized arteries. Treatment included continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT) with cytokine hemoadsorption. After surgical stabilization and histopathological confirmation of necrotizing vasculitis, immunosuppressive therapy was initiated according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommendations for the management of severe systemic vasculitis with visceral involvement. The patient received intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide (CYC) at a dose of 800 mg (corresponding to a total induction dose of approximately 2.5-3 g (as recommended for remission induction), combined with high-dose methylprednisolone with gradual tapering. Supportive measures included intravenous hydration, Mesna uroprotection, and antiemetic prophylaxis. The patient showed significant clinical improvement, normalization of electrolyte and laboratory parameters, and functional recovery within two weeks. This case underscores two severe extraglandular phenotypes of pSS: dRTA-induced hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis and fulminant systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Both are rarely reported and carry high morbidity and mortality. Recognition of hypokalemia as a potential trigger for rhabdomyolysis and vigilance for vasculitic complications are crucial for timely diagnosis. Multidisciplinary management, including nephrology, immunology, surgery, and aggressive immunosuppression, proved life-saving. pSS may present with atypical and catastrophic extraglandular involvement. Physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when encountering metabolic disturbances with multisystem features. Early recognition and coordinated intervention can significantly improve outcomes."

Timely diagnosis and prompt surgical fasciotomy of the involved compartments prevent complications, which can cause long-term morbidity, rehabilitation, renal failure, multiorgan failure, and even death if management is delayed or diagnosis is missed. The aim of this review was to identify and summarise existing literature on ACS, its complications, and the medicolegal impact when a diagnosis is delayed or missed. A narrative review was conducted using evidence from EMBASE, PubMed, and Google Scholar. There is extensive literature on the diagnosis and presenting signs and symptoms of ACS. However, not the same can be said about the effect of ACS on kidney function, rhabdomyolysis, multiorgan failure, and death. ACS is associated with a multitude of complications and has systemic effects, including electrolyte imbalance, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure. Overall, ACS is one of the most common causes of litigation in trauma and orthopaedics, and care must be taken to remember that not all ACS is associated with trauma and fractures, resulting in higher rates of delayed diagnosis. To avoid litigation and morbidity to patients, timely diagnosis of ACS is essential, combined with avoiding delays to fasciotomy. Overall, ACS can cause devastating effects to patients, even without a missed diagnosis, as its complications can range from toe clawing and Volkmann contractures to muscle necrosis, which develops into sepsis and can cause multiorgan failure and death."

    "abstract": "Background Acute appendicitis remains the most frequent paediatric surgical emergency worldwide. Although laparoscopic appendicectomy has progressively supplanted the traditional open approach in specialist paediatric centres, evidence regarding its outcomes in non-specialist District General Hospitals remains limited. In such settings, appendicectomies in children are frequently performed by general surgeons, introducing potential variability in outcomes related to surgeon experience and institutional resources. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom. All patients aged ≤16 years who underwent emergency appendicectomy for suspected acute appendicitis between 1st January 2016 and 31st August 2025 were included. The primary outcome was the immediate postoperative complications within the same admission and a 30-day postoperative admission rate, including surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, and postoperative ileus. Secondary outcomes included operative duration, length of hospital stay, and conversion rate. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v28.0. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 254 paediatric patients underwent appendicectomy for suspected acute appendicitis between January 2016 and August 2025. Following exclusion of incomplete records, 237 patients were included in the final analysis, comprising 199 (84.0%) open appendicectomies (OA), 36 (15.2%) laparoscopic appendicectomies (LA), and 2 (0.8%) laparoscopic procedures converted to open. The mean patient age was 10.9 ± 2.7 years, with a male predominance (63.3%). The mean American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade was 1.21 in the OA group and 1.25 in the LA group. Preoperative imaging was performed in 101 (42.6%) cases, most commonly ultrasound, with comparable diagnostic accuracy between groups (p = 0.99). The mean operative duration was 70.0 minutes, with median durations of 63.8, 97.2, and 195.0 minutes for open, laparoscopic, and converted cases, respectively. Complicated appendicitis occurred in 58 (28.9%) OA and 10 (27.8%) LA cases (p = 0.89). Drain placement was required in 26 (12.9%) OA and 7 (19.4%) LA cases (p = 0.31). The overall postoperative complication rate was 23 (9.7%), most frequently due to postoperative ileus (8 (3.4%)) and intra-abdominal abscess (8 (3.4%)), with no significant difference between surgical approaches. The 30-day readmission rate was 26 (10.9%), predominantly for intra-abdominal collections (10 (4.2%)) and postoperative pain (7 (3.0%)). The negative appendicectomy rate was 13 (5.5%), lower than national averages (~10-13%). The majority of procedures (174 (73.4%)) were performed by registrars under consultant supervision, reflecting the reproducibility of both approaches in a training environment. No intraoperative access-related complications or major adverse events were recorded. Conclusion Laparoscopic appendicectomy performed by general surgeons in a District General Hospital is safe and effective for paediatric patients, demonstrating outcomes comparable to open surgery with low complication and negative appendicectomy rates. The high proportion of registrar-performed procedures highlights its reproducibility in a training environment. These findings support the routine use of laparoscopic appendicectomy in non-specialist centres with appropriate training and resources."

    "title": "A Twist in the Tale: A Case Report on the Laparoscopic Management of a Rare Gallbladder Torsion.",
    "abstract": "Gallbladder torsion is a rare but potentially life-threatening surgical emergency that poses a significant diagnostic challenge due to the condition's non-specific clinical presentation and often inconclusive imaging findings. We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with sudden-onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss. Her low body mass index and initial clinical findings suggested acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonography revealed a distended gallbladder without cholelithiasis. Despite conservative management, her symptoms worsened, prompting an emergency diagnostic laparoscopy. Intraoperatively, a 360° clockwise torsion of a completely mobile, ischemic gallbladder was identified. Detorsion followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, resulting in an uneventful recovery for the short-term follow-up period of three months. Gallbladder torsion should be considered in middle-aged or elderly patients presenting with atypical features of acute cholecystitis, particularly when imaging is inconclusive and there is a poor response to medical therapy. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are essential to prevent serious complications. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for rare causes of acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) of the head and neck is a rare but rapidly progressive and life-threatening soft tissue infection that constitutes a true surgical emergency. Due to the complex anatomy of the cervicofacial region and the proximity to the upper airway, early diagnosis and management are particularly challenging, and delayed recognition is associated with high morbidity and mortality. This article aims to provide a concise and clinically oriented overview of the presentation, diagnostic pitfalls, and current management strategies for cervicofacial necrotizing fasciitis. A narrative review of the available literature was conducted and complemented by clinical experience from a tertiary referral center. Key aspects including etiology, risk factors, clinical features, imaging findings, laboratory parameters, microbiology, surgical management, airway control, and adjunctive therapies were synthesized and critically discussed. Cervicofacial NF often presents with disproportionate pain, rapidly progressive swelling, and early systemic toxicity. Odontogenic infections represent the most common source, frequently in the presence of systemic comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or immunosuppression. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice, whereas laboratory scoring systems such as the LRINEC score show limited sensitivity in head and neck infections. The cornerstone of treatment is immediate and aggressive surgical debridement combined with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, early airway protection, and intensive care support. Repeated surgical interventions are frequently required. The role of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy remains controversial and cannot be routinely recommended based on current evidence. Necrotizing fasciitis of the head and neck requires a high index of suspicion, prompt imaging, and decisive multidisciplinary management. Early surgical intervention and airway control are critical determinants of outcome. Given the rarity of cervicofacial NF, further multicenter studies and registries are needed to refine diagnostic tools, identify prognostic factors, and optimize treatment strategies, particularly in high-risk populations such as immunocompromised and oncologic patients."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency, typically resulting from luminal obstruction caused by inspissated stool, lymphoid hyperplasia, vegetable seeds, parasites, or, rarely, foreign bodies. We report the case of a 10-year-old girl presenting with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. Ultrasound and laboratory findings were diagnostic for acute appendicitis. Her previous urinary tract infection initially obscured the clinical picture, delaying suspicion of an alternative cause. The discovery of a metallic pin within the inflamed appendix highlights the importance of thorough evaluation when symptoms are atypical or recurrent. While CT scans are highly accurate for identifying ingested foreign objects, ultrasound remains a valuable radiation-free modality in pediatric patients. This case reinforces the need for prompt assessment of unusual abdominal symptoms and for considering foreign body ingestion in the differential diagnosis. It also underscores the importance of parental education to prevent accidental ingestion of sharp objects in children."

Poor clinical specificity leads to a high rate of negative (normal/No-CES) MRI scans, placing additional burden on emergency services. A proportion of patients re-present with CES-like symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess this cohort of patients and identify the incidence, clinical risk factors, comparative MRI-findings and predictive factors for subsequent True-CES. Retrospective review of prospective data of patients aged 18-65 years, who first attended with suspected-CES with a normal MRI, between January 2019-December 2022; and re-presented with suspected-CES within one year. Patients with True-CES or abnormal MRI pathology at first attendance were excluded. Clinical, bladder scan and MRI findings from first and re-presentation visits were recorded and statistically analysed. 922 patients were included, 56 (6%) had True-CES on MRI and 356 met exclusion criteria, leaving 510 patients with normal MRI on initial presentation. 43 patients (8%) re-presented within one year (mean interval 152 days), and 7 presented a third time (mean interval 126 days). There was no significant difference in clinical symptoms, gender and bladder scans between presentations. No patient showed True-CES on re-presentation MRI, all demonstrating the same MRI findings as the initial scan. This is the largest series of patients that evaluates re-presentations of suspected-CES after initial attendance with normal/No-CES MRI. There were no significant clinical/radiological differences between presentations. No patient showed True-CES on re-presentation MRI, and therefore, no predictive factors were identified."

This report aimed at discussing the applicability of anticoagulants alone as a conservative treatment strategy for patients with superior mesenteric artery (SMA) embolism. A 70-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia presented to our emergency department with persistent moderate-to-severe lower abdominal dull pain for three hours. Her vital signs and initial laboratory studies were normal. An enhanced abdominal computed tomographic scan revealed a filling defect in the SMA and an infarcted right kidney suggestive of a diagnosis of SMA embolism. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Subsequent blood sampling demonstrated an elevated D-dimer level at 6.08 mg/L. Surgery was not indicated due to the absence of bowel necrosis or overt peritonitis. The patient was admitted to the cardiology ward, where anticoagulation therapy with a 5-day course of subcutaneous enoxaparin was started, followed by switching to oral edoxaban. The patient was discharged uneventfully 1 week after admission. Our unexpected discovery of a case of SMA embolism complicated with right renal infarction underscored the need for vigilance in identifying the condition through imaging studies, pinpointing the potential contributor (e.g., atrial fibrillation), and implementing appropriate treatment. Our case underscores the importance of anticoagulation once the diagnosis is made and the efficacy of conservative treatment in selected patients without signs of systemic inflammation or peritonitis."

    "abstract": "Acute hemoperitoneum represents a gynecological and surgical emergency with significant morbidity if diagnosis and intervention are delayed. In women of reproductive age, the etiology is most frequently ruptured ectopic pregnancy; however, when pregnancy testing is negative, the differential diagnosis becomes considerably broader and less well defined. Hematosalpinx, although most commonly associated with ectopic gestations, may also occur secondary to non-pregnancy-related etiologies, including endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or primary tubal pathology. In rare instances, chronic hematosalpinx can rupture or leak, leading to substantial intraperitoneal hemorrhage and clinical features that mimic more common acute abdominal emergencies. This diagnostic uncertainty may obscure timely recognition and delay appropriate management. This case demonstrates acute hemoperitoneum secondary to chronic hematosalpinx in the context of a negative pregnancy test and highlights the diagnostic challenge. Pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound usually represents the first-line imaging modality for suspected adnexal pathology, aiding differentiation between hematosalpinx and ruptured ectopic pregnancy before proceeding to CT or surgical exploration. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are essential for accurate diagnosis, definitive treatment, and preservation of reproductive potential."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder volvulus (GV) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the torsion of the gallbladder around its vascular pedicle. It predominantly affects elderly females and is often underdiagnosed. We report the case of an 84-year-old female patient with a history of deep vein thrombosis on rivaroxaban, presenting with acute upper abdominal pain. On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable but in a poor general condition. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the right upper quadrant without guarding. Laboratory tests showed significantly elevated inflammatory markers and electrolyte disturbances. Abdominal CT demonstrated a distended gallbladder located in the mid-abdomen with a thickened wall and mild ascites. No radiopaque gallstones were detected. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was initiated. Due to persistent symptoms and worsening inflammatory parameters, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. Intraoperatively, a 180° torsion of the gallbladder around the infundibulum was identified. Due to a lack of adequate visualization, conversion to an open cholecystectomy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed transmural ischemia, hemorrhage, and purulent inflammation without malignancy. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in good general condition on the 11th postoperative day. GV should be considered in elderly patients presenting with atypical acute cholecystitis symptoms. Prompt surgical intervention is essential to prevent severe complications such as gangrene and perforation."

    "abstract": "Background: Mechanical intestinal obstruction (MIO) remains a global surgical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. While prior studies suggest divergent etiological patterns between developed and developing nations, recent trends and underlying drivers remain understudied. Objectives: This study evaluates 30‑year trends in MIO etiology and outcomes in Jordan and compares these with global data to assess convergence of patterns. Methods: A retrospective cohort study (2020-2023) of MIO patients at a tertiary Jordanian center was combined with a systematic literature review of MIO etiologies in developed and developing nations pre‑ and post‑2000. Data included demographics, management, outcomes, and mortality. Statistical analysis employed chi‑square and t‑tests. Findings: Postoperative adhesions were the leading cause of MIO (64% in 2023, rising from 25% in 1993), followed by malignancy (20%) and hernias (5%). Mortality was 10%, with sepsis as the primary cause. Global comparisons revealed adhesions as the predominant etiology in both developed (7/9 studies, 77.7%) and developing nations (8/14 studies, 57.1%) post‑2000, contrasting with historical hernia predominance in developing regions. Conclusion: Adhesions have become the leading cause of MIO globally, reflecting increased surgical access and aging populations. Socioeconomic advancements in developing nations may explain converging trends with developed countries. Standardized global reporting and adhesion prevention strategies are urgently needed."

We present two patients with pneumatosis intestinalis different in their clinical presentation, clinical course, and treatment. A 79-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented with an acute abdomen. Clinical findings and abdominal radiography suggested perforation of the digestive tract. During emergency laparotomy, multiple cystic bubbles and perforation were found in the terminal ileum, and the affected part of the ileum was resected. The second patient was a 64-year-old female under adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel for ovarian adenocarcinoma. She presented with signs of bowel obstruction. Abdominal computed tomography was diagnostic for intestinal pneumatosis. She was successfully treated conservatively. These two cases highlight the varied clinical presentation of pneumatosis intestinalis and differences in its treatment. High clinical suspicion, cautious judgment of clinical and laboratory findings, and careful assessment of the imaging findings are necessary for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."

    "abstract": "Staff in low resourced emergency units of a low-income country face the challenge of obtaining informed consent for incapacitated patients or their next of kin in a time-constrained situation often in an overcrowded environment. Therefore, we aimed to establish the informed consent practices for emergency surgical care among healthcare professional at two emergency surgical units at two tertiary teaching hospitals in Uganda. In October 2022 - February 2023we conducted key informant interviews in Uganda and purposively selected 16 staff in surgical emergency units at two tertiary teaching hospitals and directly observed the informed consent practices. Data was managed and analyzed inductively using NVivo version 12. Six themes emerged from key informant interviews including knowledge and perspectives on informed consent; processes, procedures, and practices regarding informed consent; communication strategies for informed consent; ethical considerations; benefits of informed consent during surgery; and challenges to emergency informed consent. Staff had adequate knowledge about informed consent but faced several challenges during the consent process due to lack of guiding institutional policies. Overall, the informed consent process was inadequate at both institutions with greeting of patients, disclosure of risks and assessment of understanding poorly done. Consent was conducted in a noisy environment at both institutions and there was no privacy in the public hospital. Although knowledge about consent practices by emergency staff at both institutions was good, in practice there was inadequate disclosure of risks, inadequate knowledge about the surgical procedure, risks, and benefits. Emergency staff identified the need for procedure specific consent documents which capture the information that is given to the patient and guiding policies on consent for incapacitated patients who have no surrogates."

    "abstract": "For people with a prior caesarean, avoiding a repeat caesarean and undergoing vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) may decrease both short- and long-term complications. Current options include awaiting labour or undergoing induction of labour (IOL) with mechanical cervical dilation followed by amniotomy and oxytocin infusion. Spontaneous labour is preferred as the use of exogenous oxytocin increases the rate of uterine rupture, a feared complication of VBAC. Additional options are vital to improve the chance of labour in people with a prior caesarean scar. Mifepristone, a progesterone receptor antagonist, may have utility in people with a prior caesarean. The medication occupies progesterone receptors on the myometrium, thereby making the uterus more receptive to endogenous contractile agents. The MiLabour trial is a double-blinded randomised controlled trial being carried out at two sites in New Zealand. People with a history of lower uterine segment caesarean birth are eligible. Participants are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either a single dose of 200mg of mifepristone or to a single dose of placebo. The primary outcome of the MiLabour trial is onset of labour within 48 h of ingestion of study medication. To identify an increase in the rate of spontaneous labour within 48 h from 10 to 30% in the group receiving mifepristone, a minimum of 168 participants are required with a confidence interval of 95% and power at 90%. Safely preventing repeat caesarean births is a health priority. If mifepristone is an appropriate option, this would greatly impact pregnancy care. Research in this area has been hampered by the well-founded fear of uterine rupture, a surgical emergency with the potential for morbidity and mortality. If mifepristone achieves a higher rate of labour without the need for oxytocin, this could become a standard treatment approach for people with a lower uterine segment scar as they approach their due date. The trial is registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, anzctr.org.au. Full registry title is \"Mifepristone versus placebo to increase the rate of spontaneous labour in people with a prior caesarean: A double blind randomised controlled trial (Mi-labourTrial)\".

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency. The role of laparoscopy in managing its strangulated form is usually not preferred by many surgeons due to technical challenges and concerns about safety. This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of a \"laparoscopic-first\" policy for patients with suspected strangulated SBO at a single institution. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent a laparoscopic-first approach for suspected strangulated SBO between January 2013 and December 2024. We analyzed the conversion rate to open surgery, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes for patients in whom the laparoscopic procedure was successfully completed. A total of 24 patients underwent a laparoscopic-first approach. Of these, six patients (25.0%) required conversion to open laparotomy, primarily due to difficulty in safely releasing the strangulation or poor visibility. The remaining 18 patients were successfully managed laparoscopically. Within this cohort (median age: 80.0 years), the cause of obstruction was an adhesive band in all cases (100%). Bowel resection, performed extracorporeally via the single-port site in most cases, was required in 16 patients (88.9%). The median operative time was 89 minutes. Postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ II) occurred in two patients (11.1%). There was no 30-day mortality. The median postoperative hospital stay was 9.5 days. A laparoscopic-first approach for selected patients with strangulated SBO is a feasible and safe strategy when performed with a low threshold for conversion. Favorable short-term outcomes with low morbidity can be achieved, even in an elderly cohort requiring a high rate of bowel resection. Prudent patient selection and experienced surgical judgment are paramount to the success of this approach."

    "abstract": "Gastric perforation is a life-threatening surgical emergency most commonly caused by peptic ulcer disease. Fungal involvement, particularly by Candida albicans, is exceedingly rare but associated with poorer outcomes than bacterial peritonitis. We report a case of a 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with acute abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 5 mm perforation on the anterior gastric wall, which was repaired primarily. Postoperatively, the patient developed persistent sepsis, acute kidney injury, and hypoalbuminemia. Two weeks later, imaging showed focal dehiscence at the repair site. Intra-abdominal cultures grew Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while blood cultures confirmed candidemia. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining demonstrated fungus-hyphae consistent with invasive gastric candidiasis. Despite antifungal therapy, the patient's condition deteriorated, necessitating re-exploration, where a friable gastric wall precluded re-repair. Candida albicans-associated gastric perforation is exceptionally uncommon, with less than 15 cases reported in the literature. Diabetes, malnutrition, and prolonged antibiotic exposure are key risk factors. Early recognition of fungal involvement, timely antifungal therapy, and tailored surgical management are critical to improving outcomes. This case highlights the importance of considering fungal etiologies in refractory intra-abdominal sepsis."

    "abstract": "Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) or Early Recovery Programs (ERP) represents a paradigm shift in perioperative care, aiming to mitigate surgical stress and accelerate patient recovery. While well-established in elective colorectal surgeries, its efficacy in emergency settings, particularly for acute abdomen requiring emergency laparotomy, remains less explored. This study investigates the effect of a tailored ERAS care protocol on patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in the Department of General Surgery, Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India, from April 2023 to April 2025 (CTRI No: CTRI/2023/05/052783).Seventy-eight patients aged 18-65 years, presenting with acute abdomen and scheduled for emergency laparotomy (ASA I-II), were randomized 1:1 into either the ERAS group or conventional (CONV) group (n=39 each) using computer-generated block randomization and serially numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE). The study was blinded to patients, envelope opening personnel and investigators. The primary endpoint variable was the duration of hospital stay (DHS). Secondary endpoints included postoperative morbidities/ complications (according to Clavien-Dindo classification), time to first flatus, postoperative pain scores/analgesia requirement and reexploration readmission rate. The mean DHS was significantly shorter in the ERAS group (3.17 ± 0.79 days) than the CONV one (7.87 ± 3.22 days) (p<0.001). Early removal of nasogastric tubes (64.10% on Day 0 vs 58.97% on Day ≥3, p<0.001) and urinary catheters (97.44% on Day 1 vs 69.23% on Day ≥3, p<0.001) was significantly higher in the ERAS group. Also, ERAS patients were mobilized earlier (100% on Day 1 vs 48.72% on Day 2, p<0.001) and showed faster recovery of bowel function (early flatus passage 100% vs 74.36% in ≤ three days, p<0.001). Oral diet initiation was significantly earlier in the ERAS group (66.67% on Day 1 vs 87.18% on Day ≥3, p<0.001). Overall postoperative complications were lower in the ERAS group (10.26% vs 33.33%) for immediate complications, and specifically, ERAS showed lower incidences of postoperative ileus (2.56% vs 15.36%), postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV) (5.12% vs 10.24%), lung complications (0% vs 8.18%), superficial surgical site infection (SSI) (5.13% vs 12.82%), deep SSI (0% vs 5.12%) and anastomotic leak (0% vs 2.56%) and readmission-requiring complications (5.13% vs 7.69%). Also, ERAS patients reported lower postoperative pain scores and required less opioid analgesia than subjects in the CONV group. Application of a tailored ERAS care protocol approach in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy significantly reduces the DHS, lowers intraoperative blood loss, facilitates earlier removal of tubings, promotes early mobilization and bowel function recovery, accelerates oral diet initiation and significantly decreases postoperative complications including Postoperative ileus, PONV, lung complications and surgical site infections. These findings support the adoption of ERAS principles even in challenging emergency surgical settings."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain frequently drives patients to seek care at family physician clinics and emergency departments. It often signifies serious underlying conditions, presenting diagnostic challenges for physicians. Failure to diagnose an acute abdomen can result in patient morbidity and mortality and medicolegal risks for physicians. Herein, we report an unusual gynaecological case involving a paratubal cyst in a 15-year-old girl who presented with acute abdominal pain. This case underscores the critical role of primary care physicians in identifying red flags and initiating timely specialist referral. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a large, unilocular mass in the right adnexa, measuring 18x9.8 cm. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy with a clinical diagnosis of a twisted ovarian cyst. However, intraoperative findings revealed a right paratubal cyst measuring 18x16x16 cm, which was not twisted. A fertility-preserving cystectomy was subsequently performed, successfully removing the cyst while preserving the ovary. Histopathological examination confirmed it as a benign paratubal cyst, consistent with the intraoperative findings. Although paratubal cysts are uncommon, they are a significant cause of abdominal pain. Therefore, timely identification, thorough clinical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests are essential for optimal patient care."

    "abstract": "Hydatid disease remains endemic in many regions, particularly in the Mediterranean basin. While hepatic involvement is common, spontaneous exovesiculation of a hydatid cyst with an intact daughter vesicle is exceptional. This phenomenon results from gradual detachment and extrusion of the germinal layer without rupture or spillage. A 46-year-old female with a known hepatic hydatid cyst diagnosed two years earlier by abdominal ultrasound (WHO CE2) presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. She had neither undergone surgery nor received albendazole therapy, as she was lost to follow-up after the initial diagnosis. Emergency laparotomy revealed an intact exovesiculated daughter vesicle lying freely in the peritoneal cavity, corresponding to the same cyst previously identified. The vesicle was removed intact without rupture, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Spontaneous exovesiculation of hepatic hydatid cysts represents a rare complication that can clinically mimic cyst rupture or secondary peritoneal hydatidosis. The mechanism is thought to involve progressive thinning of the pericyst and increased intracystic pressure, leading to extrusion of the intact endocyst into the peritoneal cavity. Recognition of this unusual event is crucial to avoid unnecessary extensive resections or contamination during surgery. Spontaneous exovesiculation with an intact vesicle is a rare but distinctive manifestation of hepatic hydatid disease. Awareness of this presentation and careful surgical handling are essential to ensure complete removal and prevent recurrence."

Administration of analgesia, including opioids, has not been shown to delay the diagnosis of appendicitis, yet oligoanalgesia remains a common occurrence. We aimed to determine the proportion of any analgesia and opioid analgesia administration, the median time to first analgesia administration, and to identify factors associated with the administration of any analgesia and opioid analgesia in patients with suspected appendicitis. We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study of children less than 18 years of age evaluated in the pediatric ED from June 2014 to June 2021 for suspected appendicitis. Deidentified data were extracted from the electronic record through a data repository. Our primary outcomes were the administration of analgesia and the median time to first analgesia administration. We used descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis to compare independent influences on analgesia administration. During the 8-year study period, 7065 children were evaluated for appendicitis. Overall, 4821 (68.2%) received some form of analgesia, 3157 (44.7%) received nonopioid analgesia only, and 1664 (23.6%) received opioid analgesia during their ED visit. Overall median time to first analgesia was 104 minutes. Median time to first nonopioid analgesia and first opioid analgesia was 94.5 minutes and 136 minutes, respectively. Moderate and severe pain scores, fever, tachycardia, and higher ESI level of acuity were significantly associated with analgesia administration. Analgesia administration in children with suspected appendicitis varies considerably. Efforts to target more consistent and timely pediatric pain management practices are needed."

In severe cases, incarceration or strangulation may occur, posing the risk of tissue necrosis and requiring urgent surgical intervention. We report a case of a 13-week-old female infant presenting with a painful, irreducible swelling in the left inguinal region. Surgical exploration revealed a strangulated necrotic left ovary. An oophorectomy and herniotomy were performed. An incarcerated hernia of the canal of Nuck is a surgical emergency, and limited imaging access should not delay the decision. High clinical suspicion of an incarcerated hernia and cost-effective ultrasonography are crucial for early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention to prevent irreversible complications.

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation is a very common surgical emergency with significant mortality and morbidity, which needs urgent intervention. Foreign body-related perforations are very rare, accounting for less than 1% of cases. However, Colonic perforation by Eel fish is an extremely rare phenomenon; only three cases have been reported in the existing literature. Here, we report a rare case of traumatic colonic perforation with septic shock by a rectally inserted Eel fish. A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of abdominal pain, accompanied by high-grade fever and a loss of consciousness lasting 1 day. Initial workups suggested the case might be a case of intestinal perforation with septic shock. However, in the abdominal X-ray, there was a bizarre radiopaque shadow in the right iliac fossa. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was done, and a large perforation was found at the rectosigmoid junction. Multiple pieces of fish bone were found in the peritoneal cavity. A putrefied Eel fish was found in the peritoneal cavity, approximately 25 cm in length. After thorough peritoneal toileting, a Hartmann-like procedure, where the distal end was closed and secured with a silk suture and the proximal exteriorized for fecal diversion, was done, and the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. However, despite the best medical care, the patient expired on the third postoperative day. Live animals causing rectal perforation have rarely been documented in the literature. Unusual healthcare beliefs, inadvertent sexual conduct, or criminal aggressiveness may be involved. However, the cause may remain a mystery. Rapid diagnosis with proper history, aided by imaging, with urgent surgical intervention, may increase patient survival. Therefore, emergency care physicians should also be conscious of the rare and unusual causes of intestinal perforation to reach the diagnosis promptly."

Intraoperatively, a perforated MD with adhesions was identified and resected with ileal reconstruction. Histopathology confirmed ectopic gastric tissue in the diverticulum without malignancy. The patient recovered without complications and remained symptom-free at follow-up visits after 1 week, 6 months, and 2 years. While symptomatic MD often requires immediate surgery, selected cases with localized inflammation may benefit from initial conservative management. This approach can prevent emergency procedures and allow for safer, delayed, minimally invasive resection. LATUM, chosen in our case, offered a tactile advantage and a cost-effective, hand-sewn anastomosis. To date, only three adult cases of interval MD resection have been reported, with none in children. A complicated MD in a child with acute abdomen presents diagnostic and treatment challenges. Accurate imaging aids diagnosis, and careful case selection can prevent emergency surgery, enabling delayed, minimally invasive interventions like LATUM."

    "abstract": "Polypoid endometriosis (PE) is a rare entity, but it is important to recognize because it represents a huge diagnostic challenge due to rarity. On the other hand, it presents as a mass, so it can mimic multiple medical conditions like tumors or abdominal ectopic pregnancy, just like our case. In our case, we present a 16-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted to a rural hospital with amenorrhea and an acute abdomen. Finally diagnosed with PE by accidentally! The patient underwent an emergency surgery under suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. During the operation, a mass arising from Douglas pouch was found, which was suspected to be an abdominal ectopic pregnancy. The patient was referred to our hospital for further management due to lack of surgical resources. We removed the mass and sent it for histology, which revealed benign PE. Our goal through this case is to shed light on these conditions so that they are not misdiagnosed."

    "abstract": "Juvenile granulosa cell tumor (jGCT) is a rare subtype of pure sex-cord tumors, mostly affecting patients under 20 years of age. As this tumor originates from ovarian cells specialized in sex steroid secretion, jGCT can present with endocrine disorders, including precocious puberty in prepubertal girls or menstrual irregularities in postpubertal patients. In other cases, jGCT may manifest with symptoms related to pelvic mass effects or acute abdomen, prompting urgent gynecologic or surgical evaluation. Most patients are diagnosed with ovarian-confined disease, and for these patients, the survival rates exceed 90% following surgery alone. However, advanced and relapsed disease remains a significant concern. As the survival rates for cancer continue to improve, addressing survivorship care is essential. Long-term follow-up for patients diagnosed with jGCT in childhood requires a multidisciplinary approach. We hereby describe a clinical case of jGCT diagnosed in an infant girl for whom a comprehensive multidisciplinary care plan was arranged. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, we developed a clinically applicable flowchart for the multidisciplinary management of jGCT at diagnosis and during follow-up, emphasizing the need for patient-centered care that integrates the work of oncologists, endocrinologists, surgeons, gynecologists, and geneticists."

    "title": "Diagnostic Performance of Onset Characterization vs. Time-to-Peak Assessment in Acute Abdominal Pain.",
    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of symptom onset is crucial for diagnosing acute abdominal pain, particularly to identify life-threatening conditions such as rupture, dissection, vascular occlusion, torsion, or perforation. However, the optimal method for evaluating pain onset remains unclear. To compare the diagnostic performance of two history-taking approaches for evaluating pain onset: sudden onset characterization, which asks whether the pain began suddenly, and time-to-peak assessment, which asks how long it took for the pain to reach maximum intensity, considering \"instantaneous peak\" responses as positive. Prospective diagnostic study at a single acute care hospital in Japan between December 2022 and October 2024. A consecutive sample of adult patients presenting with abdominal pain of 7 days' duration or less in the emergency department was assessed. The primary outcome was the presence of a target condition, defined as rupture, dissection, vascular occlusion, torsion, or perforation of an intra-abdominal organ, confirmed by contrast-enhanced computed tomography findings or clinical follow-up. Diagnostic measures including specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated for each approach. Of the 629 patients (median age, 58 years [interquartile range (IQR), 44-72 years]; 48.5% male), 20 (3.2%) were diagnosed with a target condition. Specificity improved from 86.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 83.8%-89.2%) with sudden onset characterization to 94.3% (95% CI, 92.1%-95.8%) with time-to-peak assessment (P < .001). Sensitivity was 40.0% (95% CI, 21.9%-61.3%) for sudden onset characterization and 30.0% (95% CI, 14.5%-51.9%) for time-to-peak assessment (P = .48). Time-to-peak assessment demonstrated higher specificity without a significant loss of sensitivity compared with sudden onset characterization. This approach may assist in ruling-in critical intra-abdominal conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain. However, neither method alone is sufficient to rule-out life-threatening conditions."

    "abstract": "Few health care organizations have structured approaches to assimilate and analyze disruptive behavior data. In 2012, Veterans Affairs (VA) developed the Workplace Behavior Risk Assessment (WBRA), a tool that collects behavioral threat data from multiple systems, consolidates it, and tailors staff training based on the frequency and type of events. This paper provides an overview of the WBRA and how it can inform nurse training. A repeated measures design evaluated trends in workplace violence reporting and event rates across 140 VA health care systems from 2013 to 2024. Data were collected annually using a standardized electronic reporting system and reviewed by multidisciplinary teams. Risk levels were categorized based on the frequency and type of disruptive events, including manual restraint and physical or verbal violence. Descriptive statistics were used to prevalence of incidents and analyze trends, particularly among nursing professionals in high-risk areas. Four VA workplace settings: acute care (psychiatric and medical/surgical), emergency/urgent care, and Community Living Centers (CLC) were consistently classified as high-risk. In FY 2024, nursing staff accounted for over 90% of reports in inpatient and extended care settings and 73% in emergency/urgent care. From FY 2013 to FY 2024, reports involving nurses increased significantly, with the largest rises in CLCs (289%) and Medical/Surgical Units (271%), whereas the proportion of physical violence reports involving nurses rose from 59% to 83%. The WBRA enables health care systems to analyze behavioral risk data to align training with risk."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency characterized by inflammation of the appendix, often attributed to luminal obstruction or bacterial infection. However, rare etiologies, such as parasitic infections, can also lead to appendicitis. Among these, Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite causing amoebiasis, is an infrequent but noteworthy cause. Amoebic infection of the appendix occurs when trophozoites invade the mucosal layer of the appendix, leading to inflammation, tissue necrosis, and, in severe disease, perforation. Amoebic appendicitis is more common in regions where amoebiasis is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical areas, and is often associated with poor sanitation and contaminated water supplies. The clinical presentation of amoebic appendicitis often mimics acute bacterial appendicitis, including abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis, making it challenging to diagnose preoperatively. The condition may coexist with colonic amoebiasis or present independently. The severity of amoebic appendicitis may be much more than that of bacterial appendicitis, and it may require more intensive management, hence the importance of knowing the diagnosis. Histopathological examination and identification of E histolytica in the appendix are crucial for a definitive diagnosis. Prompt surgical intervention, along with anti-amoebic therapy, is essential for successful management. This case report highlights an uncommon etiology of appendicitis due to amoebic infection, emphasizing the need for clinicians to consider parasitic etiologies in regions where amoebiasis is prevalent."

    "abstract": "Perforated gastric cancer (GC) is a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency. Optimal surgical management remains controversial, and evidence from high-volume centers, especially in Western countries, is limited. To evaluate surgical and survival outcomes of patients with perforated GC (PGC) according to the initial treatment strategy. A retrospective cohort study was conducted including all patients with pathologically confirmed perforated gastric adenocarcinoma treated at a single tertiary cancer center between January 2009 and March 2024. Surgical strategies were categorized as gastrectomy or primary perforation repair. Outcomes analyzed included 30- and 90-day mortality, postoperative major complications, and overall survival (OS). Among 1586 GC patients undergoing surgical treatment, 36 (2.3%) presented with PGC. The mean age was 62.5 years, and 55% were male. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III/IV was present in 58.3%, and 83% had stage IV disease, with distant metastasis in 50%. Perforation repair was performed in 26 patients (72.2%), while 10 (27.8%) underwent one-stage gastrectomy. ASA III/IV status (57.7% vs 30%, P = 0.260) and metastatic disease (57.7% vs 30%, P = 0.137) were more frequent in the Perforation Repair Group, though not statistically significant. This group also had a higher rate of diffuse-type and poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.024 and P = 0.014, respectively). Thirty- and 90-day mortality were higher in the Perforation Repair Group (61.5% vs 30%, P = 0.139; and 65.4% vs 30%, P = 0.073), without significance. Three patients initially repaired were later referred for gastrectomy. OS was significantly better in the Gastrectomy Group (P = 0.002), with median survival of 8.8 months vs 0.5 months. On multivariable analysis, gastrectomy was independently associated with improved survival (P = 0.026). When clinically feasible, gastrectomy-either immediate or delayed-provides superior survival compared to local perforation repair alone in patients with PGC."

Computed tomography revealed pneumoperitoneum and mesenteric stranding. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a jejunal perforation with secondary peritonitis, which was managed with primary repair and ureteral stenting. The patient made a full recovery. This case highlights a severe but rare complication of a common urological procedure. It underscores the critical need for high clinical suspicion in any patient presenting with abdominal pain post-ESWL, as prompt diagnosis via cross-sectional imaging and immediate surgical intervention are paramount for survival.

    "abstract": "For more than 100 years, physicians and patients considered appendicitis a surgical emergency requiring hospitalization for urgent removal of the obstructed and inflamed appendix to prevent rupture and sepsis. With the advent of modern imaging, uncomplicated appendicitis is identifiable, and later evidence showed that surgical delay does not increase the risk of appendiceal perforation. Perforation appears to be a separate disease, with uncomplicated appendicitis likely related to infection, which sometimes self-resolves. Most recently, studies compared nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics and observation followed by selective surgery to urgent appendectomy, including 4 multicenter trials involving more than 2,000 adults and 2,000 children. The results led the American College of Surgeons to endorse nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis as a safe alternative treatment. Furthermore, emergency department discharge and outpatient management appears feasible in as many as 90% of nonoperative treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis-treated patients. We review methods and results of these trials and evaluate implications for emergency care."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is a frequent surgical emergency. Although laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) is associated with favorable postoperative outcomes, open appendectomy (OA) remains widely used. Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication, with obesity recognized as a risk factor. However, body mass index (BMI) may not reliably reflect fat distribution. Subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) measured on computed tomography (CT) may offer improved predictive value for surgical outcomes. This retrospective study included 1,231 patients who underwent LA or OA for AA between 2017 and 2022. Preoperative SFT was measured on CT, and patients were analyzed by surgical technique and SFT subgroups. Postoperative complications, including SSI, were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified the SFT threshold associated with increased SSI risk. Despite similar BMI values between groups, SFT was significantly higher in LA patients (P < .001), highlighting the nonlinear relationship between BMI and SFT. LA was associated with shorter operative time (P = .004), reduced hospital stay (P = .009), and lower SSI rate (5.6% vs 13.5%, P < .001). Among patients with SFT ≥33 mm, LA resulted in significantly fewer SSIs (22 vs 50, P < .001) and shorter hospitalizations. ROC analysis confirmed SFT ≥33 mm as a strong predictor of SSI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.841). LA offers superior outcomes compared to open surgery, particularly in patients with higher SFT. The discrepancy between BMI and SFT underscores the need for direct fat measurement in surgical risk assessment. Incorporating SFT into preoperative evaluation can guide optimal surgical strategy and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR) is an uncommon but life-threatening surgical emergency. When it occurs as a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy becomes particularly complex. Published literature on SSR in the setting of SLE is sparse, and there is no clear consensus on the optimal management of such a surgical catastrophe. What is the optimal treatment strategy for patients with SSR complicated by SLE? This paper addresses these questions by providing an in-depth analysis of a representative case of SLE complicated by SSR that we successfully diagnosed and treated. Our case study details the patient's entire clinical course, from the initial presentation with non-specific abdominal pain, through confirmation via imaging diagnostics, to the final recovery achieved through a personalized treatment plan developed by a multidisciplinary team (MDT). A key finding of our research is the emphasis that, for patients with known autoimmune diseases such as SLE, the acute onset of abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability, or any signs of intra-abdominal bleeding should prompt clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion and include SSR in the differential diagnosis. Rapid identification, multidisciplinary collaboration (involving close coordination among rheumatology, critical care, surgery, and radiology), and individualized treatment decisions based on the patient's specific condition are the cornerstones of successfully managing this severe complication and improving patient outcomes. We believe the significance of our findings lies in their potential to greatly enhance clinicians' understanding of this rare yet fatal complication of SLE. The detailed diagnostic and therapeutic pathway and the decision-making rationale provided in this report can serve as a valuable reference guide for colleagues worldwide when faced with similar challenging cases, potentially saving more patients' lives."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND This report describes a rare spontaneous esophageal rupture presenting as left shoulder pain. Spontaneous transmural rupture, or Boerhaave syndrome, is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality but is often missed due to atypical signs. Mackler's triad of vomiting, acute chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema raises concern for this diagnosis but appears in only about 50% of cases, emphasizing early recognition and high suspicion in atypical presentations. CASE REPORT We present a rare case of an Asian man in his 90s with hypertension presenting with left shoulder pain and chest discomfort, accompanied by a mild cough. Physical examination revealed that a crunching sound known as Hamman's sign was heard synchronous with the heartbeat. The chest X-ray showed air in the neck's soft tissue. Computed tomography (CT) and endoscopy confirmed a mid-esophageal perforation despite initial suspicion of a muscle sprain. Notably, symptom onset followed a forceful pulling maneuver on a bedside rail to sit up, an exertional Valsalva-like strain that can acutely increase intra-esophageal pressure and is a plausible precipitant of Boerhaave syndrome. The patient died 21 days later after a do not resuscitate (DNR) order was signed. We report this uncommon case and discuss the diagnostic challenges. CONCLUSIONS This case emphasizes the importance of promptly identifying esophageal perforation in patients with vague symptoms. Early imaging and intervention are essential, and Boerhaave syndrome should be suspected when unexplained shoulder or chest pain coexists with Hamman's sign or cervical subcutaneous emphysema."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, most frequently caused by postoperative adhesions. However, neoplastic etiologies, including malignant lymphoma, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. A 78-year-old Japanese man with a history of recurrent SBO since 2021 presented with nausea and abdominal distention. He had previously undergone conservative treatment on seven occasions. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed small bowel dilatation with segmental wall thickening and enhanced contrast effect, along with enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. He was diagnosed with SBO and admitted for emergency treatment. An ileus tube was inserted, and contrast study on day 3 revealed a stricture in the ileum, which the tube could not pass. Adhesive ileus and small intestinal tumor were both considered. As conservative treatment was ineffective, laparoscopic-assisted segmental ileal resection was performed. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 21. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed FDG uptake in mesenteric lymph nodes (SUVmax 3.7), consistent with Lugano stage II disease. Due to advanced age and dementia, the patient did not undergo chemotherapy. He remains under surgical follow-up without disease progression one year postoperatively. This case highlights that repeated SBO may not always be caused by adhesions alone, and intestinal lymphoma should be considered, especially when imaging reveals suspicious findings. In cases of recurrent SBO, small intestinal lymphoma should be included in the differential diagnosis, even in elderly patients with a history of abdominal surgery."

Its non-specific clinical presentation and variable etiologies pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This systematic review synthesizes existing data on clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, management approaches, and outcomes.MethodsThis systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Initially prepared as a narrative review and subsequently advanced to systematic methodology, this study was not prospectively registered. A comprehensive search of English-language publications from 1882 to 2024 was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and reference lists. All studies reporting adult cases (≥18 years) of non-traumatic bile duct perforation were included. Exclusion criteria were pediatric cases, traumatic/iatrogenic perforations, non-English language, and unavailable full text. Data extraction included demographics, etiology, presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcomes. Missing data were documented and reported for each variable. ASA classification was retrospectively assigned based on clinical descriptions when not explicitly stated, representing a study limitation. Management approaches were categorized by temporal era to assess the evolution from traditional to minimally invasive techniques. Mortality risk factors were analyzed using chi-square test with P < 0.05 considered significant.ResultsFrom 102 eligible studies containing 223 reports, 124 adult cases of non-traumatic bile duct perforation met inclusion criteria (median age 56 years, IQR 38-68; 71.4% female). Stone-related etiology was identified in 54.0% (n = 67): choledocholithiasis (36.3%, n = 45) and cholelithiasis without choledocholithiasis (21.8%, n = 27). Clinical presentation was characterized by abdominal pain (99.1%, n = 112/113), tenderness (96.5%, n = 109/113), and vomiting (87.6%, n = 99/113). Median time to diagnosis was 3 days (IQR 1-7). Diagnostic modalities evolved significantly across eras: from 0 modalities (1880-1940) to 3.4 modalities (2010-2023). Ultrasonography (42.1%, n = 45/107) and CT (31.8%, n = 34/107) were most frequently used. Paracentesis demonstrated 91% positivity when performed (n = 38/97). Surgical treatment, primarily cholecystectomy with T-tube placement (72.8%, n = 83/114), was performed in 73.7% (n = 84/114). Preoperative ERCP was performed in 23.2% (n = 13/56). Overall mortality was 17.7% (n = 20/113), showing dramatic improvement from 45.7% (1880-1940) to 0% (2011-2023). Preoperative ERCP demonstrated a protective effect (0% vs 17% mortality). Hypotension at presentation (P = 0.086) and elevated WBC (P = 0.051) showed trends toward increased mortality.ConclusionsNon-traumatic bile duct perforation carries considerable morbidity and mortality. The evolution from purely surgical to combined endoscopic-surgical approaches has dramatically improved outcomes. A high index of suspicion and prompt use of paracentesis or cholangiographic studies (ERCP, MRCP) are critical for timely diagnosis. Treatment should be tailored to patient stability and perforation characteristics, with ERCP-based interventions favored in stable patients and immediate surgical intervention reserved for unstable or extensive cases. Early recognition and individualized, minimally invasive management strategies are key to improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. Surgical site infection (SSI) is a major cause of morbidity after appendectomy. Obesity is one of the risk factors for the occurrence of SSI. Subcutaneous fat thickness (SCFT) and Body mass index are markers for obesity. SCFT is easily readable and non-invasive marker and helps to predict the adiposity of the incision site. This study aims to find the association of SCFT with the occurrence of SSI in patients undergoing open appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. This is a prospective study is patients undergoing emergency open appendectomy. The study was conducted from June 2022 to May 2023. Preoperative SCFT at McBurney's point was measured by ultrasonography in 150 patients and these patients were followed up till 1 month in the post-operative period to watch for the occurrence of SSI. The data was analyzed using EPI-INFO 7 and EZR. Our study included a total of 150 patients. Most of the patients fell in the age group of 20-30 years. The male population was slightly higher than the female. SSI occurred in 24% of the population. Out of these, 21.3% were superficial type and 2.67% were deep type of SSI. The logistic regression of the risk factors showed that SCFT (P-value = 0.001) was significantly associated with SSI. Another risk factor, BMI was also significantly associated with SSI. This study concludes that SCFT is a risk factor for the occurrence of SSI after emergency open appendectomy in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis."

We report the case of a 25-year-old primigravida at 36+3 weeks of gestation with a known right ovarian dermoid cyst who presented with acute abdominal and back pain. She had experienced multiple previous admissions for abdominal pain that were managed conservatively. Initial investigations, including ultrasound and MRI, confirmed the presence of an 8 cm complex right ovarian mass but did not conclusively demonstrate torsion. Despite conservative management and antibiotic therapy for suspected sepsis, her pain worsened, and laboratory results showed raised inflammatory markers. Owing to persistent symptoms and clinical deterioration, an emergency caesarean section with concurrent surgical management was undertaken. Intra-operatively, the right ovary was found to be twisted four times, and a cystectomy with partial oophorectomy was performed along with delivery of a healthy female infant. Postoperative recovery was favourable, and histopathology confirmed a dermoid cyst. This case highlights the diagnostic uncertainty of adnexal torsion in pregnancy, where overlapping symptoms can obscure recognition. It underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion, early multidisciplinary involvement, and timely surgical intervention to optimize maternal and neonatal outcomes."

This report details a unique case of such a rupture in a postmenopausal woman, secondary to a fulminant pelvic infection. A 55-year-old grand multipara postmenopausal woman, with a history of recurrent lower abdominal pain, presented with severe abdominal pain, malodorous vaginal discharge, and fever of six days duration. Physical examination revealed a diffusely tender abdomen with guarding, and laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis and anemia. Abdominal ultrasound revealed intra-abdominal collection with an echo complex mass in the paracolic gutter, suggestive of abscess collection in the abdominoplevic cavity. Due to hemodynamic instability, the patient was resuscitated with crystalloids and underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy involving both surgical and gynecologic teams. Intraoperatively, about 2000 ml of purulent material was sucked out, and the uterine fundus was found ruptured, necrotic, and eaten up for which a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done. Microbiological analysis confirmed Escherichia coli infection, and histopathology ruled out malignancy, showing only inflammatory changes. A spontaneous uterine rupture in a non-gravid, unscarred uterus resulted from fulminant pelvic infection, establishing chronic pelvic inflammatory disease as an etiology through direct tissue erosion. This case underscores the necessity of considering genital tract sepsis in postmenopausal women presenting with acute abdomen and highlights the critical importance of emergent surgical intervention, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and rigorous adherence to PID management guidelines for preventing this life-threatening complication."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous uterine rupture outside of pregnancy is exceptionally rare, with adenomyosis potentially acting as a structurally weakening substrate. Most reports involve gravid patients, underscoring the unusual nature of nongravid presentations. We report the case of a 26-year-old nongravid, nulliparous woman who presented with sudden, diffuse abdominal pain and hemorrhagic shock. Imaging revealed a markedly enlarged, heterogeneous uterus with hemoperitoneum. Emergency laparotomy evacuated approximately 3000 mL of blood. Multiple transmural ruptures precluded repair, necessitating total hysterectomy with adnexal preservation. Histopathology confirmed diffuse adenomyosis with extensive hemorrhagic necrosis.This case highlights that in reproductive-age women presenting with an acute abdomen, a negative pregnancy test, and an enlarged heterogeneous uterus, spontaneous rupture secondary to adenomyosis should be considered. Early resuscitation and definitive surgical management are critical, and proactive counseling is recommended for patients with severe adenomyosis who may be at risk for catastrophic decompensation."

    "title": "Ultrasound-Guided Regional Anesthesia as Primary Analgesic Management in the Orthopedic-Surgical Emergency Department of an Affiliated Hospital: A Retrospective Analysis over a 6-Year Period.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Ultrasound (US)-guided peripheral regional anesthesia (pRA) is gaining increasing importance in emergency medicine as an effective, low-ridsk alternative to general anesthesia (GA), procedural sedation (PS), or opioid therapy. By enabling rapid, direct pain management in the emergency department (ED), pRA can help preserve scarce surgical and anesthetic resources and, in some cases, avoid inpatient admissions. The aim of this study was to analyze the indications, techniques, and clinical impact of pRA in the orthopedic-focused ED of an affiliated hospital. Materials and Methods: All pRA and PS procedures performed over a six-year period were retrospectively reviewed among 35,443 orthopedic-trauma emergency patients. pRA was carried out under US guidance with standardized monitoring. Diagnoses, block techniques, effectiveness, and complications were analyzed descriptively. Results: A total of 1292 patients (3.7%) underwent either pRA (n = 1117; 3.2%) or PS (n = 175; 0.5%). pRA was performed in 22% of cases for interventions such as reductions or extensive wound management. In 78%, pRA was applied for analgesia, for example, in the diagnostic work-up and treatment of non-immediately operable fractures, lumbago, or arthralgia. The most common pRA techniques were brachial plexus blocks (54%) and femoral nerve blocks (25%). Fascial plane blocks (6.1%) and paravertebral blocks (1.5%) were rarely used. PS was performed in 175 of 1292 patients (13%), although pRA would have been feasible in 159 of these cases. No complications of pRA were observed, and GA could routinely be avoided. Conclusions: US-guided pRA proved to be an effective and safe alternative to PS, GA, or systemic analgesia for selected indications, allowing immediate treatment without the need for operative capacities. To ensure safe application, these techniques should be an integral part of the training curriculum for ED personnel."

    "abstract": "Appendiceal endometriosis is a rare cause of acute appendicitis, accounting for approximately 1% of cases.This report describes a case of a female patient presenting with right iliac fossa pain and clinical signs of acute abdomen, who underwent emergency appendectomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed acute appendicitis secondary to endometriosis, establishing a direct pathological link. Subsequent imaging with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and MRI revealed multifocal deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) involving the rectosigmoid junction, retrocervical region and rectovaginal septum. Based on these findings, the patient underwent a second surgical intervention, which included rectovaginal shaving. Intestinal endometriosis, a common manifestation of DIE, affects adjacent pelvic structures in up to 93% of cases. TVUS and MRI are essential tools for diagnosis and preoperative planning. While surgical treatment improves quality of life, access to timely, multidisciplinary care remains a major challenge in resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common surgical emergency in preterm infants; nonetheless, besides supportive measures, no treatment is available. NEC significantly increases length of hospitalization of preterm infants, causes severe morbidity and up to 70% mortality. Despite limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms, prematurity, dysbiosis and an underdeveloped immune system are known to increase the risks of developing NEC. The low weight of preterm infants (often < 2000 g) and unpredictable progression of NEC hinder clinical research; hence, most of our mechanistic understanding of NEC pathophysiology has arisen from animal models. Recent advances in bacterial genomic analyses highlighted the intestinal microbiome's key role in NEC, strengthening the concept that this disease results from an interaction between the patient's developing immune system and their microbiome. This notion is supported by the moderate effect of probiotics in preventing NEC. Here, we review the current knowledge on how the immune system interacts with the intestinal microbiome in early life, including in relation to NEC, describe the current evidence from cohort studies, clinical trials, in vivo and in vitro models used to study NEC, and methods to modulate the immune system and microbiome in early life. Knowledge on the early-life microbiome and immune system in health and diseases, including NEC, can be harnessed to develop novel and urgently needed immunomodulatory and microbiota-based therapeutics."

    "abstract": "Splenectomy is a procedure, most commonly performed for trauma, hematological disorders, and certain malignancies. Rare indications such as congenital bleeding disorders, pancreatitis complications, and splenic cysts may also warrant splenic removal, especially in life-threatening conditions or diagnostically unclear scenarios. In this retrospective descriptive case series, we report cases of six patients who underwent splenectomy for rare indications. The first case involves a 13-year-old boy with congenital afibrinogenemia who presented with signs of acute abdomen and class 3 hypovolemic shock. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large perisplenic hematoma and hemoperitoneum suggestive of spontaneous hemorrhage. Despite fibrinogen replacement therapy, the patient remained hemodynamically unstable, and emergency open splenectomy was performed, which proved to be life-saving. The second and third cases involved middle-aged men with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis who developed large intrasplenic pseudocysts with spontaneous rupture, evidenced by contrast extravasation on CT. Both underwent emergency splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy. Histopathology revealed pseudocysts with no evidence of malignancy. These cases confirm how the anatomical proximity between the pancreatic tail and spleen can facilitate enzymatic injury leading to splenic rupture, an infrequent but dangerous complication of chronic pancreatitis. The remaining two cases were two young female patients who presented with large splenic cysts, and one of them had undergone prior percutaneous catheter drainage and developed infection. Both underwent elective splenectomy due to persistent symptoms and diagnostic uncertainty. Histopathology revealed a benign epithelial cyst in one and a splenic abscess in the other, illustrating the importance of definitive surgical management in selected cystic lesions of the spleen. The final and most aggressive case involved a 44-year-old woman who presented in hemorrhagic shock. Imaging revealed a ruptured splenic mass with multiple lesions in the liver. Emergency splenectomy was performed, and histopathology confirmed primary angiosarcoma of the spleen. Despite surgical intervention, the patient succumbed postoperatively, underscoring the dismal prognosis associated with this rare vascular malignancy. Each case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic role of splenectomy in atypical scenarios. Awareness of such rare indications can aid timely surgical decision-making when imaging or conservative strategies are inconclusive or ineffective. Though uncommon, conditions such as congenital bleeding disorders, pancreatitis-related complications, and primary benign splenic cyst must be considered in the differential diagnosis of splenic pathology. Splenectomy remains a definitive solution in selected cases."

    "abstract": "Pica is a complex behavioral condition with both psychological and biological components, characterized by the persistent ingestion of non-nutritive substances. It often coexists with other mental health conditions, and when left untreated, may lead to life-threatening medical complications. While gastrointestinal obstruction is a known outcome, intussusception caused by pica is extremely rare, particularly in adolescents. We report a case of a 13-year-old Middle Eastern girl of mixed Emirati Indonesian descent, with a history of emotional distress and familial instability, who presented with persistent abdominal pain and vomiting. Imaging revealed an intussusception caused by foreign bodies extending from the stomach to the duodenum. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, during which multiple ingested objects were removed, including hair ties, shoelaces, and a thin metal wire. A postoperative psychiatric evaluation led to a diagnosis of pica and major depressive disorder. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was initiated shortly after diagnosis, and the patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement, including cessation of pica behaviors without pharmacological intervention. This case demonstrates the rarity of intussusception as a surgical complication of pica and highlights the importance of early psychiatric assessment and coordinated multidisciplinary care. The patient's recovery was facilitated by timely psychosocial intervention, with marked improvement following the introduction of CBT."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to hernia remains a prevalent surgical emergency disproportionately affecting elderly and co-morbid populations. Limited high-quality data exist to guide evidence-informed interventions for hernia-related SBO. This study explored the management and outcomes of hernia-related SBO (hSBO) for patients captured in European Society for Trauma and Emergency Surgery (ESTES) SnapSBO database. SnapSBO is a prospective multicentre time-bound study that accrued consecutive inpatient admissions between November 2023 and May 2024. The present analysis was restricted to patients with abdominal wall hernias. Management pathways were categorized as direct to surgery (DTS), successful non-operative management (NOM), or surgery after trial of NOM (NOM-T). Outcomes of interest included complications, 30-day in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and functional recovery assessed through patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) using the PRO-diGI tool. Among 1737 patients, SBO due to abdominal wall hernia was noted in 386. The median patient age was 73 (range 16-98) years, with 64.8% of patients aged > 65 years. Primary inguinal/abdominal wall hernias were the most common (62.2%). Of the patients, 51.6% were categorized as DTS, where 17.1% required surgery after NOM-T. NOM was successful in 31.2% of patients. Parastomal hernia management led to the highest complication rate (57.1%) and prolonged postoperative LOS (mean(standard deviation) 9.1(4.8) days; P = 0.030) compared with other hernia types. Functional recovery measured in 218 patients was significantly worse in those with parastomal hernia than in those with incisional or primary inguinal hernias (mean(standard deviation) bowel function scores 68.6(22.5) versus 83.6(17.6) and 82.0(20.3), respectively; P = 0.009). There is significant variability in practice and outcomes for hSBO management. Patients with parastomal hernias represent a high-risk subgroup. Future research should focus on PROMs and in developing evidence-based, context-specific guidelines for hSBO management."

Its clinical presentation is often nonspecific, frequently mimicking other causes of acute abdomen and delaying diagnosis. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with a previous near-total colectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis, admitted with acute abdominal pain and radiologic signs suggestive of pneumoperitoneum. Emergency laparotomy revealed a double omental internal hernia, with small bowel herniation through the gastrocolic and hepatogastric ligaments, resulting in obstruction and bowel perforation. Surgical treatment consisted of hernia reduction, segmental enterectomy, and closure of the omental defects. The patient had an uneventful recovery. This case highlights the importance of recognizing a double omental hernia as a potential cause of acute abdomen, especially in patients with previous abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis band syndrome (ABS) is difficult to diagnose preoperatively due to nonspecific clinical and radiological findings. Most cases are identified during laparotomy performed for presumed small bowel obstruction. Management ranges from simple appendectomy to extensive bowel resection, depending on the viability of the involved segments. Imaging, particularly CT, may show indirect signs such as transition points, but confirmation often requires surgical exploration. We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with no prior medical history, who presented with a two-day obstipation. The CT scan showed bowel obstruction secondary to a terminal ileum stenosis. We performed a laparoscopic exploration during which we found a portion of the small bowel had herniated through a loop formed by an inflamed appendix, and a laparoscopic appendicectomy was successfully performed. The patient showed no complications in the two-week and one-month follow-ups. Given its diagnostic difficulty and potentially severe complications, ABS should be considered in all cases of small bowel obstruction of unknown origin, particularly in patients with no history of prior abdominal surgery. Prompt surgical intervention is critical to reduce morbidity and mortality. Tailoring the surgical approach, laparoscopic or open, based on clinical context, remains essential for optimal outcomes."

    "abstract": "The appendix is a small, worm-like diverticulum of the caecum, potentially having a role in regulating intestinal microbiota and immunology. Inflammation of the appendix, acute appendicitis, is one of the most common reasons for acute abdominal pain in children and adults and surgical emergency visits worldwide. The pathophysiology of appendicitis is still poorly understood. During the past decade, evidence has overturned the long-lasting dogma that all appendicitis cases have a clinical course inevitably progressing to perforation and life-threatening peritonitis unless operated upon in a timely manner. Instead, this natural course occurs only in a smaller proportion of patients, for whom emergency appendectomy remains mandatory. Advances in diagnostic accuracy following utilization of clinical scoring systems and imaging has enabled more accurate pre-interventional assessment of appendicitis disease severity. While some patients still require urgent surgery, the majority can be treated successfully with antibiotics, and in some the disease has even been shown to resolve spontaneously. This has confirmed the notion of at least two different forms of appendicitis: non-perforating and perforating, often referred to as uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. Unified definitions of these forms are still undergoing rigorous research and debate, hampering both comparison of different studies and the establishment of unified treatment guidelines. The current knowledge on the safe and effective outcomes of non-operative treatment alternatives has further underlined the need for standardized uniform definitions of appendicitis severity and assessment of the success of two fundamentally different treatment options."

    "abstract": "Orbital fractures in children are uncommon. The existing literature shows a wide range of estimates for incidence, etiology, management protocols, and outcomes. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that orbital wall fractures with extraocular muscle entrapment is a surgical emergency due to the risk of permanent diplopia caused by ischemia and necrosis of the muscle. Pediatric orbital floor injuries have distinct mechanistic features and fracture patterns when compared to adults. As a result, the prevalence, typical presenting signs and symptoms, and management considerations for pediatric orbital floor fractures differ from those for adults. We report the case of a 7-year-old boy with a right orbital floor fracture presenting with restricted upward gaze and binocular diplopia. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a linear fracture with herniation of orbital contents into the maxillary sinus. Surgical management was performed via a transconjunctival approach assisted by endoscopic lighting, allowing accurate identification and repositioning of the fractured segment. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with complete resolution of diplopia and restoration of ocular motility. Endoscopic-assisted repair of linear orbital floor blowout fractures through a transconjunctival approach seems to be a safe and effective method for treating orbital blowout fractures in children. If the bone is not comminuted, the pediatric orbital floor fracture can be repositioned with careful dissection and preservation of the periosteum."

Prompt recognition guided by diagnostic imaging is critical for improving outcomes in affected children. A previously healthy nine-month-old male presented acutely with significant abdominal distension, metabolic acidosis, and septic shock. Initial plain radiography indicated colonic obstruction, and subsequent ultrasound was equivocal in elucidating the cause of obstruction. Eventually, a contrast-enhanced barium enema confirmed the cause of obstruction as colonic volvulus, demonstrating a characteristic \"beaked\" appearance within the transverse colon. Subsequent emergent laparotomy revealed extensive bowel necrosis due to volvulus-induced ischemia caused by intestinal malrotation. Timely surgical management included ileocolectomy, temporary open abdomen management, and successful staged reconstruction, resulting in complete patient recovery. This case highlights the importance of considering uncommon, acutely life-threatening etiologies of disease processes in the pediatric population such as colonic volvulus. It also signifies the indispensable role of dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging studies that not only facilitate the diagnosis of colonic volvulus in the pediatric population but also allow for timely surgical management, and thus significantly reduce morbidity and mortality."

Ultrasound imaging suggested early appendicitis, and therefore, a laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. Intraoperatively, multiple E. vermicularis worms were found within the appendiceal stump. Histopathological examination revealed no acute inflammation, but confirmed the presence of the E. vermicularis in the lumen. The patient recovered uneventfully and received antihelminthic therapy with albendazole.

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening cardiovascular surgical emergency with a mortality of 20-25%. This review offers an overview of current research on the morphology, taxonomy, epidemiology, and anesthetic, perfusion, and surgical strategies involved in ATAAD. Moreover, this review examines methods for predicting mortality risk and explores clinician-patient interactions, particularly those involving patients who refuse blood transfusions. The literature search included PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases, as well as any relevant books. This review references 144 sources: 129 peer-reviewed articles and 15 book chapters or books. Modern classification systems utilize aortic zones based on the location of intimal tears and the extent of dissection; recent updates have included coronary artery dissection as an additional mapping criterion. Socioeconomic factors are linked to higher ATAAD incidence and poorer long-term survival post-surgery. The duration of global myocardial ischemia correlates with mortality and is a key element in the surgical strategy. Compared to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA), moderate HCA with cerebral perfusion provides benefits such as reduced bleeding and improved survival. Standard prediction models may not accurately assess risks in patients with life-threatening anemia who refuse blood transfusion. Therefore, incorporating Auckland and Hamilton anemia mortality risk scores alongside conventional tools can improve prognostic accuracy and support personalized management. An interpretive-deliberative model balances patient preferences with surgical outcomes, especially in bloodless surgery. Advances in surgical and endovascular management, as well as postoperative strategies for residual aortic disease, have also been explored. Significant progress has been made in assessing in-hospital mortality, improving doctor-patient communication, refining anesthetic and perfusion techniques, and enhancing surgical management of ATAAD. However, further research is needed to validate these approaches."

    "abstract": "Recurrent fever and acute abdominal pain are common reasons for emergency visits, particularly in adolescents. These symptoms often lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgeries like appendectomy. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a rare autoinflammatory disorder, should be considered in patients with periodic febrile abdominal episodes, especially in those with a migration background. A 19-year-old male of Syrian origin presented with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, arthralgia, and pleuritic chest pain. Similar episodes had occurred in the past and resolved spontaneously. Physical examination revealed signs of peritonism; laboratory results showed elevated C‑reactive protein (CRP; 35 mg/L) with normal white blood cell counts. Abdominal ultrasound excluded appendicitis. Conservative treatment (fluids, analgesics, dietary rest) led to full symptom resolution within 2 days. After recovery, a detailed family history revealed consanguinity and a relative with similar symptoms. The diagnosis of FMF was made based on the Tel Hashomer criteria. Colchicine therapy (1.0 mg/day) was initiated. This report illustrates a case of late-onset FMF in a migrant adolescent, with typical symptoms but without definitive serositis or confirmed genetic diagnosis at the time of treatment. The case underscores the importance of thorough history-taking and highlights the need to avoid unnecessary CT scans in similar settings. Awareness of FMF is crucial in nonendemic regions experiencing increased migration from high-incidence countries. HINTERGRUND: Wiederkehrendes Fieber und akute Bauchschmerzen gehören zu den häufigen Vorstellungsgründen in der Notaufnahme, insbesondere bei Jugendlichen. Diese Symptome führen nicht selten zu Fehldiagnosen und unnötigen chirurgischen Eingriffen wie einer Appendektomie. Das familiäre Mittelmeerfieber (FMF), eine seltene autoinflammatorische Erkrankung, sollte bei Patienten mit periodischen febrilen Bauchbeschwerden – v. a. mit Migrationshintergrund – differenzialdiagnostisch berücksichtigt werden. Ein 19-jähriger Mann syrischer Herkunft stellte sich mit akuten Schmerzen im rechten Unterbauch, Fieber, Arthralgien und atemabhängigen Thoraxschmerzen vor. Ähnliche Episoden waren in der Vergangenheit spontan abgeklungen. Klinisch zeigten sich Zeichen eines Peritonismus, laborchemisch ein erhöhter Level für C‑reaktives Protein (CRP; 35 mg/l) bei normalen Leukozyten. Sonographisch ergaben sich keine Hinweise auf eine Appendizitis. Unter konservativer Therapie (Infusionen, Analgetika, Nahrungskarenz) kam es innerhalb von 2 Tagen zur vollständigen Besserung. Eine ausführliche Familienanamnese offenbarte eine Konsanguinität und einen ähnlichen Fall in der Familie. Die Diagnose FMF wurde anhand der Tel-Hashomer-Kriterien gestellt. Eine Therapie mit Colchicin (1,0 mg/Tag) wurde begonnen. Der Fall zeigt eine Spätmanifestation des FMF bei einem jugendlichen Migranten mit typischer Klinik, jedoch ohne nachgewiesene Serositis oder genetische Bestätigung zum Zeitpunkt der Behandlung. Er verdeutlicht die Bedeutung einer sorgfältigen Anamnese und spricht gegen den routinemäßigen Einsatz der Computertomographie(CT)-Diagnostik bei ähnlicher Konstellation. Das Bewusstsein für FMF sollte auch in Ländern mit niedriger Prävalenz erhöht werden."

We report the case of a 67-year-old woman who developed caecal volvulus 24 hours following routine colonoscopy with polypectomy. The patient presented with progressive cramping abdominal pain and nausea. Computed tomography revealed caecal displacement to the right upper abdomen without proximal ascending colon distension. Laparoscopic exploration confirmed caecal volvulus with ischaemia but no perforation. A laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was successfully performed, representing the first reported case managed with this minimally invasive approach. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on postoperative day 5. This case emphasises the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion for caecal volvulus in patients presenting with abdominal pain following colonoscopy. Early recognition and prompt laparoscopic intervention can prevent progression to bowel necrosis and perforation while offering superior outcomes compared to traditional open surgical approaches. The minimally invasive technique provides excellent visualisation, reduced morbidity, and faster recovery times, establishing it as the preferred management approach when surgical expertise is available."

The Alverado score is widely used but is limited in Asian populations, prompting the development of the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) score. This study aims to compare the accuracy of both systems. A prospective study was conducted at Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, from August 2024 to September 2025, including 100 patients with suspected acute appendicitis. Both RIPASA and Alvarado scores were assessed and compared with intraoperative findings using the Gomez classification. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated. The mean patient age was 28.1 years; 54% were male. Common presenting features were anorexia (90%), tenderness (99%), rebound tenderness (94%), and pain migration (76%). The RIPASA score showed sensitivity of 91.9%, specificity of 64.3%, PPV of 94.1%, NPV of 56.3%, and accuracy 88%. The Alvarado score demonstrated sensitivity of 94.2%, specificity of 57.1%, PPV of 93.1%, NPV of 61.5%, and accuracy 89%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 for RIPASA and 0.76 for Alvarado. Both the RIPASA and Alvarado scores demonstrated high accuracy, with Alvarado showing slightly higher sensitivity (94.2% vs. 91.9%) and RIPASA offering better specificity (64.3% vs. 57.1%). Overall, both scoring systems proved reliable tools for diagnosis, helping reduce negative appendectomy rates and improving clinical decision-making."

    "title": "Biomarkers for Detecting Surgical Emergency in Acute Abdomen-A Prospective Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "In the emergency setting, acute abdominal pain is a diagnostic challenge. We evaluated the diagnostic value of selected inflammatory and stress biomarkers to identify surgical emergency. Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute abdominal pain were included in this prospective observational study. Copeptin, cortisol, procalcitonin, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured upon presentation and at 4 h, in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte and neutrophil cell counts. At 2 weeks, follow-up was performed by telephone interview. Of the 304 patients included, 46 (15%) patients had a surgical emergency and 87 (29%) a medical emergency. On admission, CRP, procalcitonin, and leukocyte and neutrophil cell counts were higher in patients with a surgical emergency (P = 0.024, P = 0.009, P = 0.0032, and P < 0.0001, respectively) and medical emergency (all P < 0.001) as compared to patients without emergency. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was to predict surgical emergency and were good for leukocyte (AUC 0.75, 95% CI, 0.66-0.84) and neutrophil cell count (AUC 0.75, 95%, CI 0.66-0.84), mediocre for CRP (AUC 0.64, 95% CI, 0.55-0.73) and procalcitonin (AUC 0.62, 95%CI 0.45-0.75), and not useful for IL-6, copeptin, or cortisol. A recursive partitioning prediction model yielded CRP as the most relevant biomarker to predict surgical emergency. The stress biomarkers copeptin and cortisol were not useful for identifying surgical emergency. Among the tested biomarkers, initial leukocyte and neutrophil cell counts, CRP and procalcitonin, and IL-6 at Hour 4, performed similarly to identify surgical emergency in acute abdomen.

    "abstract": "Background Perforation peritonitis, a common surgical emergency, is associated with postoperative respiratory complications. This study aimed to measure diaphragmatic excursion and thickness using preoperative ultrasound in patients undergoing laparotomy for perforation peritonitis, thereby predicting extubation outcomes at the end of the surgery. Methodology A total of 80 patients aged 18-60 years, belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical class I-III, scheduled to undergo laparotomy under general anesthesia were included in this study. The study sample was divided into the following two groups (40 in each group): Group P, perforation peritonitis patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, and Group C, patients undergoing elective laparotomy. Preoperatively, diaphragm excursion on deep inspiration and diaphragmatic thickness at end-inspiration and end-expiration were measured using ultrasound in both groups. Respiratory rate, arterial blood gas analysis, abdominal girth, duration of surgery, extubation outcome, and duration of mechanical ventilation were recorded and compared between the groups. Results Diaphragm excursion was significantly reduced in Group P (1.62 cm) compared to Group C (3.3 cm) (p < 0.001). Diaphragm thickness at end-inspiration and end-expiration was significantly reduced in Group P compared to Group C (p = 0.008). In Group P, diaphragm thickness at end-inspiration and end-expiration was significantly higher in those who were successfully extubated. From the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a diaphragmatic thickness cut-off value of 0.15 cm at end-inspiration and 0.14 cm at end-expiration predicted successful extubation in Group P. Conclusions In this study, diaphragmatic excursion and thickness were significantly reduced in patients with perforation peritonitis. Hence, diaphragmatic thickness can be a useful predictor of extubation outcomes at the end of the surgery."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide. While the use of preoperative antibiotics has shown clear benefits in improving outcomes for uncomplicated appendicitis, the necessity of routine postoperative antibiotics remains a topic of debate. This meta-analysis evaluates the impact of preoperative and postoperative antibiotics on patient outcomes, adverse events, and hospital stay duration. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, including 14 studies published over the past 15 years, focusing on patients aged 14-65 with uncomplicated appendicitis. Both experimental and observational designs were included. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, Excel, and RevMan to assess adverse effects, hospital stays, and antibiotic duration outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, with all included studies showing low risk across key domains. The study received no external funding and was not registered in any clinical trial database. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrated significant benefits, including shorter hospital stays and reduced postoperative complications. Metronidazole was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic, followed by cefoxitin and cefuroxime. Conversely, the use of postoperative antibiotics was associated with increased rates of adverse events, including Clostridium difficile infections, deep surgical site infections, and urinary tract infections. Patients receiving only preoperative antibiotics experienced fewer complications and improved overall outcomes than those receiving postoperative antibiotics. Preoperative antibiotics, such as metronidazole and cefoxitin, are sufficient to optimize outcomes in uncomplicated appendicitis. Postoperative antibiotics offer no additional benefit and are associated with a higher risk of adverse events. These findings support limiting antibiotic use to the preoperative phase, aligning with antimicrobial stewardship principles, and ensuring safer, more cost-effective patient care. A revision of clinical guidelines is recommended to reflect these findings and enhance evidence-based practices in managing uncomplicated appendicitis. Despite some heterogeneity in study design and follow-up variability, this meta-analysis remains robust due to consistent inclusion criteria, high-quality studies, a large sample size, and rigorous methods like the Mantel-Haenszel model."

    "title": "Rate and Outcomes of Second Visits to the ED Among Patients Discharged With Non-specific Abdominal Pain in a Tertiary Hospital in Saudi Arabia.",
    "abstract": "Background It is well documented in the literature that the most common diagnosis for acute abdomen is nonspecific abdominal pain (NSAP). The context of NSAP in the literature is either (a) ranking it among other causes of acute abdomen or (b) addressing that some patients revisited the ED with a different diagnosis after being initially labeled with NSAP. These two contexts create a gap, as no article has discussed the characteristics of patients mislabeled with NSAP in KSA. In other words, what might be the risk factors making their presentation nonspecific? In this article, we discuss the characteristics of patients labeled with NSAP who revisited the ED within three days and were subsequently diagnosed with a different condition, if found. Methodology The study was a retrospective cohort study. Data were taken from case files at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), a tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using the Best-Care system. All adults who attended the ED and were discharged with the diagnosis of NSAP (ICD code R10.4) between 2015 and 2023 were included. Patients were then tracked for 3 days, which is the cutoff commonly used in ED research. Statistical analysis was performed using R 4.3. Categorical variables were summarized using counts and percentages, and continuous variables (normal and non-normal) using mean ± SD and median/IQR. The chi-square test was used to assess associations, and logistic regression analysis was used to predict revisits. Only statistically significant variables were included, and hypothesis testing was performed at a 5% level of significance. Results A total of 932 patients were discharged from the ED with NSAP. Out of these, 69 (7.4%) revisited the ED within 3 days and received a different diagnosis. The study found significant age differences between the two groups: the median age was 40 years (IQR: 27-58) in non-revisited patients and 29 years (IQR: 21-42) in re-visited patients. A higher proportion of re-visited patients had a BMI over 25 (64.1% vs. 40.6%, p < 0.001). Surgical history also showed a significant difference, with 39.1% of re-visited patients having a history of abdominal surgery compared to 18.2% of non-revisited patients (p < 0.001). Acute cholecystitis was the most common diagnosis during the second visit, accounting for 32.3% of revisits, followed by appendicitis. Re-visited patients also showed a higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (13.4% vs. 1.27%) and a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes (8.96% vs. 1.27%). Conclusion This retrospective cohort study revealed several significant findings regarding factors associated with ED revisits following an initial discharge with a diagnosis of NSAP. The most common diagnosis identified during the second visit was acute cholecystitis."

    "abstract": "Recurrent isolated angioedema (AE) is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Only a rigorous clinical approach can rule out the most obvious diagnoses. The recent international classification recognizes 7 subgroups: mast cells induced AE (spontaneous, allergic), Bradykinin mediated AE (Hereditary or acquired C1Inh; kallikrein-kinin mutations), HAE due to vascular endothelium dysfunction, drug induced AE and AE of unknow origin. Bradykinin-mediated hereditary angioedema (BK-HAE) are rare conditions. The currently accepted incidence of HAE-C1INH is approximately 1 in 50,000 inhabitants per year. Bradykinin is released following activation of the kallikrein/kinin pathway in the vascular lumen and is rapidly degraded by kininases, the main one being angiotensin-converting enzyme. The disease manifests as subcutaneous or submucosal edema. When an attack occurs in the pharynx/larynx area, there is a high risk of asphyxia (25% in the absence of specific treatment). This risk is unpredictable and exists throughout the patient's life. AE can be localized in the abdomen and resemble a surgical emergency. The disease is more symptomatic in women, as estrogen is an aggravating factor. In AE due to C1INH deficiency, the diagnosis is based on the search for a weight and/or functional deficiency in C1 inhibitor. In the forms with normal C1 inhibitor, the diagnosis is solely genetic, such as F12, PLG, or KNG1 mutations. The prognosis for these rare diseases has changed considerably in recent years with the arrival of new, highly effective specific drugs. Patient education is an important part of management. We present here the French protocol for the diagnosis and management of bradykinin-mediated hereditary AE."

It is rare for a uterine leiomyoma to present with a massive hemoperitoneum; only a few cases have been reported in the literature. We present the case of a 41-year-old Ghanaian female with a history of bilateral tubal ligation who presented to the emergency department with syncope and severe abdominal pain. Initial evaluation revealed hypotension, tachycardia, and significant free intraperitoneal fluid on ultrasound. An exploratory laparotomy identified a massive hemoperitoneum secondary to a ruptured vessel overlying a uterine fibroid, necessitating subtotal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy. This case highlights the importance of considering spontaneous hemoperitoneum in women with uterine fibroids who present with acute abdomen and hemodynamic instability."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific clinical presentations and limitations of imaging and blood tests. Saliva has emerged as a promising diagnostic medium because it is non-invasive, painless, inexpensive, and highly acceptable for pediatric patients. Salivary biomarkers may provide rapid and child-friendly adjuncts to existing diagnostic pathways. A systematic literature search was performed in Ovid/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies assessing salivary biomarkers in pediatric appendicitis. Eligible studies included children with suspected or confirmed appendicitis and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of salivary markers compared to clinical, laboratory, or imaging standards. To date, only three salivary biomarkers have been investigated. Leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) demonstrated high specificity of 100% but low sensitivity of 35-36%, with diagnostic accuracy ranging from AUC 0.77 to 0.85. C-reactive protein (CRP) showed excellent diagnostic performance with sensitivity of 91.3% and specificity of 95.4% (AUC 0.97), and strong correlation with serum CRP (ρ = 0.96). Irisin showed sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 60% with estimated AUC around 0.75, suggesting potential as an adjunct marker but limited as a standalone test. Salivary biomarkers in pediatric appendicitis are promising but remain underexplored, with evidence limited to small, single-center studies totalling fewer than 300 patients. Their advantages include feasibility, tolerability, and suitability for integration into point-of-care testing. Future research should focus on multicenter validation, development of multi-marker salivary panels, and application of biosensor technologies. With further evidence, salivary diagnostics could complement existing strategies and improve the accuracy and child-friendliness of appendicitis care."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common non-obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. Diagnosing appendicitis in the third trimester remains especially challenging due to physiological changes that obscure clinical presentation and limit the utility of imaging modalities. These challenges can lead to diagnostic delays, increasing the risk of severe complications for both mother and fetus. We present a complex case of a 36-year-old pregnant woman at 29 + 4 weeks of gestation who developed acute appendicitis with an atypical clinical course. Her initial symptoms were nonspecific and misattributed to gastrointestinal discomfort related to pregnancy. Her condition progressively worsened, leading to an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. Intraoperative findings confirmed a perforated, necrotic appendix. Postoperatively, she experienced multiple complications, including ileus, wound dehiscence, and complete eventration of the abdominal wall. These required two additional laparotomies and the application of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy for effective wound management. Despite the severity of maternal complications and the risk of preterm delivery, a multidisciplinary team provided coordinated care. The patient was delivered vaginally at 34 + 4 weeks using vacuum assistance. The neonate, who developed sepsis, was treated in the neonatal intensive care unit and discharged after 24 days. Both mother and child ultimately recovered. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of appendicitis in late pregnancy and the potential for severe postoperative complications. Prompt surgical intervention, high clinical suspicion, and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial. Moreover, this report adds to the limited literature on the use of VAC therapy for abdominal eventration in pregnancy, demonstrating its feasibility and safety in selected cases."

    "abstract": "Perforated viscus remains a high-risk surgical emergency with significant mortality despite advances in perioperative care. Accurate risk stratification is essential to guide triage, surgical decision-making, and postoperative management. The available scoring tools are the Boey score (three-variable risk model: shock, comorbidity, delay >24 hours), Peptic Ulcer Perforation (PULP) score, Mannheim Peritonitis Index (MPI), Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the Enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity (POSSUM), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II), each addressing different dimensions of patient risk, ranging from physiological stability to intra-abdominal severity. Simpler models such as Boey and MPI are valuable in emergency and resource-limited settings due to their bedside applicability. In contrast, PULP and APACHE-II offer greater precision by integrating systemic comorbidities and biochemical indices, making them more suitable for tertiary centers. POSSUM provides a balanced approach by combining physiology with operative severity, though it may overestimate mortality. No single model is universally applicable, highlighting the need for context-specific use. Future research should focus on hybrid scoring systems that merge clinical simplicity with modern predictive analytics for broader global relevance."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen requiring urgent surgical intervention, and early recognition of complicated forms, such as perforation or gangrene, is crucial to reducing mortality and complications. In recent years, bilirubin has gained attention as a potential biomarker of disease severity. The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of total bilirubin concentration as a marker of complications in AA, with particular emphasis on perforation, and to analyze its effectiveness in differentiating uncomplicated and complicated forms. A systematic search of PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar was performed to identify studies exploring the relationship between bilirubin levels and the severity of AA. The literature indicates a correlation between hyperbilirubinemia and perforated appendicitis. Bilirubin has higher diagnostic specificity compared to classical inflammatory markers such as leukocytosis or C-reactive protein (CRP), especially when combined with clinical assessment and imaging studies. Both retrospective and prospective studies suggest that elevated bilirubin significantly increases the risk of complicated disease. Based on the evidence synthesized in this review, hyperbilirubinemia appears to be associated with complicated forms of AA, particularly perforation. While it demonstrates higher specificity than classical inflammatory markers, the available studies emphasize that it should not be used as a stand-alone diagnostic marker. Instead, bilirubin may be considered a supportive parameter, particularly when interpreted together with clinical evaluation and imaging findings."

Methodology This retrospective, observational study included adults with confirmed colonic perforation treated between January 2022 and March 2025 at a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Data collection encompassed demographics, clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, diagnostic workup (imaging modalities, including X-ray and CT, and colonoscopy when available), perforation characteristics (site, suspected etiology, etc.), intraoperative findings, and definitive surgical management and its outcomes. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize patterns and outcomes, with particular attention to associations among perforation site, cause, and chosen surgical strategy. Results The cohort showed a female predominance of 9/15 (60%), with 60% aged 60 years or older. All patients presented with abdominal pain; tenderness was universal, 15/15 (100%), with abdominal rigidity in 86.6% (13/15) and peritoneal signs in most cases. Pneumoperitoneum was detected on imaging in all patients, 15/15 (100%). The transverse colon was the most frequently involved site, 8/15 (53.3%), followed by the sigmoid, 3/15 (20%), and descending colon, 2/15 (13.3%). Etiologies included iatrogenic, colonoscopy-related perforations, as well as infectious, inflammatory, and spontaneous causes. Imaging consistently demonstrated pneumoperitoneum, with CT and X-ray aiding localization and planning. All patients underwent surgery, with management strategies including Hartmann's procedure, 6/15 (40%), primary repair, 5/15 (33.3%), and primary repair with diverting stoma, 3/15 (20%), decisions guided by the degree of contamination and patient stability. The outcomes underscore the importance of prompt surgical intervention and individualized decision-making to optimize results in this setting. Conclusions Early recognition and meticulous, patient-specific surgical management are essential for favorable outcomes in colonic perforation. The transverse and sigmoid colon emerged as common sites, reflecting anatomical vulnerabilities and procedure-related risks in this cohort. Cross-sectional imaging facilitates rapid localization and planning, enabling appropriate selection among primary repair, diversion, or resection with stoma. This study reinforces the value of a multidisciplinary, tailored approach to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with colonic perforation in resource-limited, high-volume centers, emphasizing the potential for improved survival through timely, evidence-informed clinical decisions."

We report 2 cases of GT in patients initially suspected of acute appendicitis, both presenting with right lower abdominal pain. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical and radiological findings in these 2 patients to enhance our understanding of and management for this condition. Case 1 was a thin 80-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, persisting for 3 days. Case 2 was a thin 84-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with right-sided abdominal pain that had persisted for over 20 hours. Emergency abdominal ultrasound examination revealed a low-lying gallbladder in case 2 and an enlarged gallbladder with a small amount of perigallbladder fluid collection in both patients. Non-contrast computed tomography revealed an enlarged gallbladder with disrupted gallbladder mucosa in both cases. In addition, the first case exhibited a whirlpool structure in the cystic duct region, alongside a pedicled hyperdense structure located between the neck of the gallbladder and the liver bed. In the second case, a strip-like structure was observed within the cystic duct area. Postoperative pathology confirmed acute gangrenous cholecystitis in both patients' gallbladders and acute simple appendicitis in their appendices. Both patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Both patients recovered well and were discharged within 1 week. GT presenting with appendicitis-like symptoms is relatively uncommon. For thin elderly female patients presenting with signs related to appendicitis, the possibility of GT should be considered. Non-contrast computed tomography is valuable for diagnosing GT."

    "abstract": "A frequently occurring surgical emergency in gynecology is ovarian torsion, which occurs when the ovary twists on its ligamentous supports, which obstructs blood flow. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and tadalafil against ischemia‑reperfusion (IR) injury in a rat model of ovarian torsion. Female Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n=8/group): Control, IR, IR + tadalafil, IR + HBOT and IR + tadalafil + HBOT. Ovarian torsion was induced under anesthesia for 2 h, followed by daily post‑operative treatments with tadalafil (10 mg/kg) and/or HBOT (2.4 atmospheres absolute for 1 h) for 7 days. Blood and ovarian tissue specimens were collected for analysis at the end of the treatment period. IR‑induced ovarian tissue injury significantly decreased the counts of primordial, primary and preantral follicles compared with those in the control group. In addition, serum ELISA and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that IR injury reduced anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels in serum and the granulosa cells of primary, preantral and secondary follicles. HBOT alone resulted in a significant increase in the counts of primordial, primary and preantral cells, as did the combination of HBOT with tadalafil. In addition, AMH immunoreactivity significantly increased in primary, preantral and secondary follicles following treatment with HBOT and tadalafil. Furthermore, all therapeutic interventions elevated serum AMH levels in the IR model rats. These findings suggest that tadalafil treatment combined with HBOT may help protect ovarian reserve and mitigate IR‑induced tissue damage in rat ovaries."

The plasma renin level increased in the immediate postoperative period in the NE group (median difference [MD]: 21 μIU/mL (interquartile range [IQR]: 5-51], p = 0.020), but not in the PE group (MD: 7 μIU/mL [IQR: -1 to 33], p = 0.336). However, the plasma renin levels were significantly decreased in both groups at 24 hours postoperation. Furthermore, in both groups, the levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone were reduced at 24 hours postoperation. The upper quartile of the plasma renin level before surgery was associated with higher vasopressor requirements and higher acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence. Furthermore, the groups showed no significant difference in AKI incidence (relative risk [RR]: 1.50 [95% CI, 0.65-3.47], p = 0.569), myocardial injury (RR: 1.11 [95% CI, 0.64-1.93], p = 0.497), and 30-day mortality rate (RR: 1.00 [95% CI, 0.44-2.27], p = 1.000). PE and NE exert similar effects on RAAS components and postoperative complications. A higher plasma renin level before surgery is associated with greater vasopressor requirement and a higher incidence of postoperative complications."

    "title": "Surgical approach to intraabdominal sepsis: a damage control approach can reduce stoma rates.",
    "abstract": "In patients with perforated diverticulitis and/or intraabdominal sepsis (IAS), the best surgical strategy remains controversial. While open, non-restorative Hartmann's procedure represents the procedure of choice in many centers, ostomy-sparing and minimally invasive techniques have been increasingly utilized due to short- and long-term benefits, including a reduced stoma rate. This dynamic manuscript illustrates strategic and technical considerations of the standardized institutional staged or damage control approach to IAS. The institutional strategy to IAS is demonstrated through an emergency procedure for perforated Hinchey IV diverticulitis in a 70-year-old woman developing an acute abdomen. After a diagnostic laparoscopy, stercoral peritonitis was confirmed and the patient underwent laparotomy. A two-stage approach (stage 1: damage control with resection of the perforated sigmoid, abdominal lavage, vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) - stage 2 (36-48 h later and during daytime): primary colorectal anastomosis and abdominal closure) was performed. While laparoscopic exploration represents the standard approach in hemodynamically stable patients, the staged procedure (resection and sepsis control) helped refine the definite strategy (goal of reconstruction and no ostomy) in a clinically improved patient during the second step. The patient recovered well during the critical therapeutic window, allowing to perform primary anastomosis and a stoma-free discharge. Clinical condition during surgery, surgeon expertise, and comorbidities are key determinants to decide whether to proceed to primary anastomosis in the case of IAS. An institutional series of our group revealed feasibility and safety of the staged approach, with 65% stoma-free patients at discharge. A standardized algorithm based on intraoperative hemodynamic parameters intends to guide surgical decision-making during staged procedures to seek optimized conditions allowing to proceed to primary anastomosis. A staged approach according to a predefined decisional framework may help decrease the need for ostomy creation in patients with IAS."

    "abstract": "Gastric volvulus is a rare but serious gastrointestinal disorder that can lead to obstructive complications, necessitating prompt diagnosis and management. Rarely, gastric volvulus coexists with scare conditions like pancreatic volvulus and wandering spleen as a triad, further complicating clinical management. Although the primary presentation is acute and severe abdominal pain, other findings may exist, including nausea, bilious vomiting, fever and chills, leukocytosis, and elevated liver or pancreatic enzymes. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by advanced radiologic techniques, mainly abdominal computed tomography scans. Early recognition and timely surgical correction are essential to prevent severe complications such as ischemia and necrosis. This paper presents two cases of gastric volvulus with pancreatic volvulus and wandering spleen, highlighting the importance of radiologic awareness and multidisciplinary management in such rare presentations."

We report a unique case of a 78-year-old male who presented during the 2024 Islamic pilgrimage season with symptoms of epigastric pain and persistent vomiting. Imaging revealed a mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus associated with a large hiatal hernia and a wandering spleen-an uncommon triad, especially in adults. The patient underwent successful laparoscopic reduction of the volvulus, cruroplasty, Toupet fundoplication, and anterior gastropexy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in good condition. This case highlights the importance of high clinical suspicion, appropriate imaging, and timely surgical intervention in managing gastric volvulus. It also underscores the need to identify and address contributing anatomical abnormalities to prevent recurrence. To our knowledge, this is the first reported adult case of concurrent gastric volvulus, hiatal hernia, and wandering spleen."

We report an elderly male who underwent emergency surgery for ileal volvulus and, several years later, developed sigmoid volvulus (SB) requiring colectomy. This case highlights a possible shared predisposition (elongated/mobile bowel on a narrow mesenteric base and postsurgical adhesions), underscores the diagnostic value of computed tomography, and supports early elective sigmoidectomy after successful endoscopic detorsion to prevent recurrence and ischemic complications."

    "abstract": "Background: Multiple high-powered magnet ingestion is a surgical emergency due to inter-loop attraction leading to ischemia, necrosis, perforation, and fistula formation. While well documented in children, adult cases-particularly those complicated by entero-enteric fistula-remain rare, and management is largely extrapolated from pediatric guidelines. Objective: To present a rare case of adult entero-enteric fistula following multiple neodymium magnet ingestion, we review the literature and propose an adapted management algorithm for adults. Methods: A narrative PubMed review was performed to identify pediatric and adult cases of magnet ingestion complicated by gastrointestinal fistula. Search terms included magnet ingestion, entero-enteric fistula, neodymium, and adult. Reported case characteristics, diagnostic modalities, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Results: A 38-year-old male with schizophrenia presented with small bowel obstruction five days after ingesting multiple magnets. Abdominal radiography revealed clustered radiopaque bodies in the distal ileum. Emergency laparotomy identified an entero-enteric fistula caused by pressure necrosis from inter-loop magnetic attraction. Segmental enterectomy with side-to-side anastomosis was performed, with uneventful recovery. The literature review identified only a few adult cases, which showed similar pathophysiology but frequent diagnostic delays and higher complication rates compared with pediatric cases. Conclusions: This case adds to the scarce adult literature on magnet-induced entero-enteric fistula and supports the adaptation of pediatric-based protocols for adults, with attention paid to psychiatric comorbidity and delayed presentation. Early imaging, timely intervention, and multidisciplinary care are essential to prevent severe gastrointestinal injury."

    "abstract": "Right iliac fossa (RIF) pain is a frequent and challenging presenting complaint in emergency departments, encompassing a wide spectrum of acute and chronic conditions. To compare effectiveness of ultrasound versus initial clinical and lab tests for diagnosing acute appendicitis in patients with RIF pain, while also evaluating the impact of ultrasound operator experience as well as portable ultrasound system. This retrospective study included 525 patients (aged ≥15 years) presenting with acute RIF pain to three emergency departments in Thi-Qar Governorate, Iraq (January 2024-January 2025). Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (PPV and NPV), and accuracy for diagnosing acute appendicitis were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of diagnostic accuracy for both modalities. Among 525 patients, appendicitis was the final diagnosis in 273 (52.00%). For diagnosing acute appendicitis, ultrasound demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (89.7% vs 67.4%), specificity (67.1% vs 46.4%), and overall accuracy (78.9% vs 57.3%) compared to clinical-laboratory assessment. Independent predictors of higher ultrasound accuracy included US operator experience (Senior EM Physician vs. Resident: aOR 3.15, 95% CI: 1.80-5.52) and presence of rebound tenderness (aOR 2.40, 95% CI: 1.35-4.27). For clinical-laboratory assessment, ED physician experience (Senior vs. Resident: aOR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.15-2.41) was one of the independent predictors of higher accuracy. Ultrasound significantly outperforms initial clinical-laboratory assessment in diagnosing acute appendicitis among patients with RIF pain in this setting. US operator experience is a key determinant of ultrasound accuracy. Our findings support the effective use of portable ultrasound systems in the emergency setting."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias are rare causes of small bowel obstruction and are often difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Retro-appendicular internal hernias are exceedingly rare, with very few reports in the literature. This case is noteworthy for involving a patient with no prior history of abdominal surgery, highlighting an unusual presentation of a retro-appendicular internal hernia. A man in his mid-60s, with no history of abdominal surgery, presented to the emergency department with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed localized peritonism, and laboratory results were unremarkable. CT showed signs of small bowel distension with segmental hypoperfusion of the bowel loop in the right lower quadrant. Given the clinical presentation of an acute abdomen, the patient underwent exploratory laparoscopy, which revealed a herniation of the small intestine into the retro-appendicular space. The herniated bowel appeared ischemic but was successfully reduced without further need for resection. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. This case underscores the importance of considering internal hernias in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, even in patients without prior abdominal surgery. Awareness of rare anatomical variants such as retro-appendicular hernias is critical, as early surgical exploration can prevent bowel necrosis and reduce morbidity. This report contributes to the limited research literature on retro-appendicular internal hernias and emphasizes the value of maintaining a high index of suspicion in atypical presentations."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children and adolescents, yet its global epidemiological trends and burden remain understudied. This study aims to analyze the global burden of appendicitis in children aged 0-19 years from 1990 to 2021. We extracted data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study to analyze the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to appendicitis. Age-standardized rates and trends were stratified by sex, age group, region, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI). In 2021, there were 4.53 million new cases of appendicitis and 360 249 DALYs among children and adolescents globally. The highest age-standardized incidence rate (270.38 [95% uncertainty interval {UI}, 180.93-386.54]) was observed in high-SDI regions, while the highest mortality rate (0.23 [95% UI, 0.14-0.35]) occurred in low-SDI regions. From 1990 to 2021, global age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates decreased slightly, while mortality and DALYs declined substantially. However, the age-standardized incidence and prevalence rates began increasing after 2015 and are projected to rise by over 21% by 2040. Frontier analysis highlighted strong performance in Somalia and Niger among low-SDI countries, whereas the United States Virgin Islands, a high-SDI region, exhibited considerable potential for improvement. The burden of appendicitis among children and adolescents remains significant, with pronounced inequalities across SDI levels. Addressing these inequities requires targeted interventions, such as improving surgical infrastructure in low-SDI regions and optimizing resource utilization in high-SDI regions. These findings provide a foundation for evidence-based policies to ensure equitable care for this vulnerable population."

    "abstract": "Torsion is the most frequent complication of ovarian dermoid cysts. Adnexal torsion typically presents as a severe abdominal pain and is treated as an acute surgical emergency. However, if surgery is delayed or the diagnosis is not made in a timely manner, autoamputation of the ovary is a very rare, but possible, complication. Herein, we report a case of an autoamputated ovary with a dermoid cyst and review the literature. A 33-year-old patient presented with pelvic pain lasting three weeks and was scheduled for a laparoscopy due to the presence of bilateral ovarian cysts, with a dermoid cyst identified on the left ovary. During the procedure, it was discovered that both the left fallopian tube and ovary were absent. The infundibulo-pelvic ligament appeared to terminate abruptly at the pelvic brim. Moreover, an 8 cm pelvic mass was found lodged in the cul-de-sac, which was extensively adherent to the bowel and the uterus, and was covered by vascular omental tissue. Histopathological analysis revealed that this pelvic mass was a dermoid cyst. The cyst contained adipose tissue, hair, and microscopic ovarian stroma, confirming the diagnosis. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing and managing pelvic masses. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for ovarian torsion and consider the possibility of autoamputation when an ovary is not found in its anatomical location, especially if imaging suggests the presence of a dermoid cyst. This case also underscores the importance of meticulous surgical dissection for the complete removal of such masses."

    "abstract": "Traumatic pericardial tamponade is a life-threatening emergency caused by the rapid accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac, leading to cardiac compression, decreased cardiac output, and obstructive shock. Early recognition and prompt intervention are crucial in preventing cardiovascular collapse. However, timely diagnosis remains challenging due to overlapping injuries and non-specific clinical signs in trauma settings. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the diagnostic approaches, emergency management strategies, and surgical outcomes associated with pericardial tamponade in trauma patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2000 and 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies reporting on diagnosis, emergency interventions, and surgical outcomes in traumatic pericardial tamponade were included. Five studies involving a total of 546 patients met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently conducted by two reviewers using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. The majority of cases resulted from penetrating chest trauma. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) proved to be the most effective tool for early diagnosis, significantly improving detection rates in emergency settings. Pericardiocentesis (PCC) was primarily used as a temporizing measure, while definitive management commonly involved surgical intervention, most notably thoracotomy or pericardial window. Early surgical intervention, especially within the first hour post-injury, was associated with significantly improved survival outcomes. Traumatic pericardial tamponade is a time-critical surgical emergency where rapid diagnosis and early operative management are vital. While PCC may serve as a bridge in select scenarios, definitive surgical treatment remains the gold standard. Multicenter prospective studies are needed to establish standardized protocols and improve outcomes across various healthcare settings."

A 62-year-old patient, in septic condition and exhibiting symptoms of acute abdomen, was admitted to our hospital five days after undergoing diagnostic endometrial curettage due to postmenopausal metrorrhagia. Inflammatory markers were elevated. An emergency computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the presence of pneumoperitoneum and multiple fluid collections with air-fluid levels throughout the peritoneal cavity. Emergency laparotomy was performed, with severe fecal peritonitis secondary to small bowel perforation being observed. No primary uterine perforation site was confirmed intra-operatively, although histological examination of the endometrial curettage material confirmed the presence of smooth muscle tissue and debris of intestinal epithelium. Salvage surgery for neglected peritonitis was carried out, including enterectomy that involved the perforation site and creation of two ileostomies (end ileostomy and mucus fistula). The patient's worsening condition prompted admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she remained for 22 days and was subsequently transferred to the surgical ward, where she remained for another 15 days. She was discharged from the ward in good condition with instructions for follow-up assessment and scheduling of bowel restoration surgery. Based on the description of this rare case, the diagnostic approach and therapeutic options for this rare complication are discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the benefits of early diagnosis, which significantly contributes to ensuring the best prognostic outcome."

This study aimed to determine current practice and short-term outcomes globally. A prospective, international cohort study of patients presenting with acute diverticulitis to secondary care units was undertaken. Countries were stratified by geographical region and income groups. Patients presenting over a 44-week recruitment period (1/10/2020-31/8/2021) were included. Patient and disease covariates, management and short-term outcomes were captured in a secure web application. The primary outcome of interest was the geographical variation in presentation and treatment. The secondary outcome was treatment success at 30-days. 6189 patients presenting with acute diverticulitis (confirmed by CT imaging and/or surgical findings) were recruited. 2798 of 6189 patients presented with uncomplicated disease of whom 849 (30.3%) were treated in an ambulatory manner. Overall antibiotic use ranged across geographical regions from 1838 of 1982 patients (92.7%) to 340 of 342 patients (99.4%). Surgical intervention was undertaken in 782 of 6189 patients (12.6%) varying between geographical regions from 29 of 342 patients (8.8%) to 59 of 195 patients (42.8%). 675 of 782 patients underwent resection, of whom 180 (26.6%) underwent formation of a primary anastomosis. 707 of 6189 (11%) patients experienced treatment failure, with an overall 30-day mortality of 2.8% (169/6189 patients). 30-day mortality was higher in patients with complicated disease (142/3391 patients, 4.5%) and in low-middle income units (20/335 patients, 6.2%). This large, global study reveals significant variation in the management and outcomes of patients presenting to hospital with acute diverticulitis.

    "abstract": "Transomental hernia (TOH) is a rare internal hernia, representing approximately 1-4% of all internal hernia cases. The spontaneous form, occurring in patients without a history of abdominal surgery or trauma, is exceptionally uncommon and presents a significant diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific clinical features. TOH typically involves herniation of small bowel loops through a defect in the greater omentum. We report a case of spontaneous TOH in a 76-year-old male undergoing chemotherapy for synchronous primary malignancies - left lung adenocarcinoma and right renal cell carcinoma - who presented with features of intestinal obstruction. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography suggested internal herniation with ischemia. Intraoperative findings confirmed approximately 100 cm of small bowel incarcerated through a 3-cm defect in the right side of the greater omentum. Age-related omental atrophy, along with chemotherapy-induced mesenteric fibrosis, microvascular injury, and impaired regenerative capacity, likely contributed to the defect formation. An emergency midline laparotomy was performed, involving resection of the gangrenous bowel and the creation of a double-barrel enterostomy. Postoperatively, distal enteral refeeding was critical in electrolyte correction, nutritional support, and early recovery. TOH carries a high risk of strangulation and should be considered in elderly patients with bowel obstruction, even with no history of prior abdominal surgery, especially those receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. Although rare, TOH should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in elderly oncology patients, even without previous abdominal surgery. Timely surgical intervention is vital to reduce morbidity and optimize outcomes."

However, identifying the optimal approach in a patient with a history of prior chemoradiation and multiple native-tissue pelvic reconstructive surgical procedures may be challenging. We present here a multidisciplinary case of a 74-year-old patient where flap and graft material placement were utilized as part of her management. She presented as a transfer from an outside hospital for vaginal evisceration of small bowel contents. She was hemodynamically stable, and physical examination revealed 14 cm of edematous, nonreducible, hyperemic bowel protruding beyond her introitus. General surgery and plastic surgery services were consulted for multidisciplinary management. She underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy with an oblique rectus abdominus flap (performed by plastic surgery), small bowel resection and right hemicolectomy (by general surgery), and closure of the distal posterior vaginal wall dehiscence site with placement of a saline-reconstituted decellularized fish skin xenograft within the vaginal defect (by urogynecology). Her postoperative course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged home on postoperative day (POD) 11. She was recovered and asymptomatic at her 4-week postoperative follow-up visit, where she declined scheduling further follow-up appointments. In conclusion, vaginal incision dehiscence with evisceration is best approached early on in a multidisciplinary manner. Select patients, such as those with an extensive pelvic surgical history, multiple vulnerable vaginal incision lines, and history of recurrent prolapse may benefit from consideration of flap placement and application of graft material for wound healing and surgical site integrity at the time of repair."

    "abstract": "Splenic lymphangiomas, per se, are exceedingly rare, benign congenital malformations of lymphatic vessels, typically diagnosed in childhood or incidentally in adulthood. Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (AMNs) are also infrequent, often asymptomatic, and usually discovered incidentally. To date, the co-occurrence of these two distinct primary lesions in the same patient has not been previously reported. We present the case of an 83-year-old Turkish female who underwent emergent abdominal surgery for an acute abdomen secondary to a strangulated left diaphragmatic herniation. Multiple perforations were identified in the transverse colon, accompanied by widespread ischemia involving the terminal ileum, cecum, and right colon. Upon laparotomy, a diaphragmatic defect measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter was identified in the left hemidiaphragm. The herniated abdominal viscera were meticulously reduced and examined, and multiple perforations were identified in the transverse colon, accompanied by widespread ischemia involving the terminal ileum, cecum, and right colon. An emergent splenectomy was performed due to severe ischemia and irreparable structural damage observed within the compromised hernia sac, with the resection of the terminal ileum, the ascending, and transverse colon. During the operative intervention, both a splenic lymphangioma and a low-grade AMN were incidentally discovered. The histological diagnosis was confirmed with factor VIII-related antigen (factor VIII-R antigen) immunohistochemical positivity. The patient, unfortunately, succumbed on the fifth postoperative day due to progressive multi-organ failure. This report documents the first known instance of the simultaneous identification of splenic lymphangioma and AMN as primary lesions in a single patient. This unique case underscores the critical importance for surgeons to remain vigilant for unexpected pathologies and highlights the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach in evaluating rare incidental findings for appropriate classification and follow-up."

While treatable with nasogastric tubes, delayed surgery for SBO with ischemia drastically increases mortality (up to 25%). This study aim to investigate the diagnostic utility of computed tomography (CT) for small bowel obstruction (SBO). A comprehensive search for relevant articles was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, encompassing studies published until February 2024. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened to identify eligible studies. We then assessed the quality of the included articles, extracted relevant data, and performed a rigorous analysis. A total of 40 observational studies comprising 4,502 patients were eligible for the analysis. CT demonstrated high performance in both ruling in and ruling out SBO. The pooled sensitivity was 77.55% (95% CI: 71.41-83.69%) and specificity was 86.43% (95% CI: 82.75-90.12%), supporting its continued use for diagnosing SBO in patients with acute abdominal pain. Our findings indicate that CT offers a reliable tool for diagnosing SBO in patients with abdominal pain. CT effectively identifies key signs of SBO, facilitating informed clinical decision-making. However, observed variations in sensitivity and specificity across studies highlight the importance of using CT alongside other diagnostic modalities for a comprehensive evaluation.

However, it can also occur in benign conditions such as diverticulitis, where the clinical course may be less severe. Management decisions must balance the alarming imaging appearance with the patient's clinical stability. We present the case of a 47-year-old male patient with underlying diverticular disease who developed extensive HPVG and mesenteric venous gas secondary to sigmoid diverticulitis. Despite the dramatic radiological findings, he remained haemodynamically stable with no signs of peritonism. Blood cultures grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, suggesting a gas-forming infective source. He was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and close monitoring. Repeat imaging showed a significant reduction in portal venous gas, and the patient made a full recovery without requiring surgery. He was discharged on day 9 with outpatient follow-up for elective sigmoid colectomy. This case highlights that HPVG, while often considered a surgical emergency, may be managed non-operatively in selected patients with diverticulitis who are clinically stable. Multidisciplinary evaluation and careful correlation between imaging and clinical findings are essential in guiding appropriate management."

Thromboelastography (TEG) is a viscoelastic, point-of-care test that provides a comprehensive real-time assessment of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Although TEG has been successfully adopted in trauma and cardiac surgery for individualised transfusion guidance, its role in rAAA has not been sufficiently explored. We conducted a review of studies published between 2009 and 2024 to assess the utility of TEG or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in rAAA management. Evidence from vascular surgery suggests reduced blood-product transfusions and postoperative bleeding. Additional data from cardiac surgery and emergency/trauma demonstrated improved survival, fewer reoperations and cost efficiency. Although there are few direct studies on the utility of TEG in rAAA and these are mostly descriptive, the results presented in this review suggest its potential role in vascular emergencies. To confirm this, well-designed prospective studies are essential to determine when and how TEG should guide decision-making in this critical setting."

    "abstract": "Carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) is a rare but potentially fatal complication in head and neck cancer patients who have undergone free flap reconstruction and/or radiotherapy. This review examines CBS, with incidence ranging from 0.5-0.9% in patients treated with modern radiotherapy to 3-4% in postoperative patients, and exceeding 20% in previously irradiated cases. CBS carries high mortality (40-60%) and neurological morbidity (∼60%). The pathogenesis involves arterial wall breakdown due to radiation-induced endarteritis, surgical exposure of vessels, wound complications, and tumor recurrence. CBS is classified as threatened (exposed carotid), impending (sentinel bleed), or acute (active hemorrhage). Diagnosis relies primarily on clinical assessment, computed tomography angiography, and catheter angiography with balloon occlusion testing. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach with immediate stabilization followed by definitive intervention. Treatment options include surgical management (ligation, bypass, flap coverage) and endovascular techniques (deconstructive embolization or reconstructive stent grafting). The endovascular approach has become first-line for many CBS cases, though hybrid approaches combining endovascular stabilization followed by surgical intervention show promise. Despite advancements, prognosis remains guarded with 30-day survival of 70-77% and 1-year survival as low as 32% in patients with active cancer. Rebleeding occurs in 20-40% of cases despite successful initial treatment. Prevention through prophylactic flaps in high-risk cases and early recognition of warning signs are emphasized. A multidisciplinary strategy with timely intervention offers the best chance for improved outcomes in this surgical emergency."

    "abstract": "Paraduodenal hernia (PDH), a rare cause of acute abdominal pain in the emergency department, is difficult to diagnose and can cause serious issues by mimicking common conditions. We present a 49-year-old male with a right PDH causing a 2-day history of nausea, bowel obstruction, and periumbilical/right abdominal pain. CT revealed bowel obstruction and a right PDH, confirmed intraoperatively. A Ladd procedure was performed, and the patient recovered well. This case highlights specific CT signs that were instrumental in diagnosing this rare disease, ultimately guiding a successful treatment strategy for the patient."

    "title": "Emergency obstructed hernia admissions over the COVID-19 national lockdowns: a regional review.",
    "abstract": "Emergency obstructed hernias pose a significant clinical challenge and can lead to higher complication rates, prolonged recovery, bowel resection and recurrence. Early diagnosis, urgent surgical intervention and appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis are key. Our study aimed to describe the impact of national lockdowns on emergency obstructed hernia admissions and the effect on patient demographics and compliance with recommendation rates. Should another lockdown be in place in the future this could help us prepare plans for appropriate care and service provision. Patient records for those who received emergency surgery on obstructed hernias at a single site during the three COVID-19 lockdown periods in England were reviewed and underwent thematic analysis. A temporal comparison was undertaken, and 105 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences in age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade and length of stay. The mean duration of symptoms was 1,307 ± 1,779 days in the lockdown group vs 215 ± 593 days in the control group (p < 0.005). Long-standing hernias were the primary reason for admission in the lockdown group compared with 'other medical issues' in the control group. Both the 7-day (7.5% vs 4.6%; p < 0.05) and 30-day (10.0% vs 7.7%; p < 0.05) re-admission rates were higher in the lockdown group than the control group. This study suggests that more patients presented in obstruction and as an emergency with long-standing hernias during the COVID-19 lockdown. We recommend enacting adequate postoperative follow-up to reduce higher rates of re-admission, and better patient education or discussions with primary care to ensure adequate forward referrals of hernias."

We describe a case of a 49-year-old woman admitted for acute abdominal pain due to an ileal stenosis that proved to be metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. Mammography and ultrasonography were negative, while breast MRI showed only subtle lesions. Histology combined with immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis, consistent with an occult primary tumor. The patient underwent segmental ileal resection, followed by hormonal therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, with an uncomplicated early postoperative course. This report underlines the importance of considering atypical causes of acute SBO in women, particularly when initial imaging is inconclusive."

    "abstract": "Diverticular disease (DD) represents a prevalent clinical challenge, especially in the aging population. The sigmoid colon is the most frequently affected area. However, the presence of DD in the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the duodenum and jejunum, underscores the need for comprehensive understanding and management. In this minireview we analyzed the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of DD with a specific focus on jejunal diverticulosis. Although the incidence of gastrointestinal DD increases with age, the male and female prevalence is the same. Clinical presentation is either asymptomatic or with unclear abdominal symptoms. However, complications such as perforation and bleeding can occur in a subset of patients and demand urgent diagnosis and surgical treatment. Imaging alternatives, including CT and enteroscopy, play key roles in diagnosis. Surgical management is warranted in cases with persistent bleeding or more complicated acute abdomen. Jejunal diverticulosis (JD) is a less common condition and poses a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Bleeding has been reported as the most important complication in JD. Therefore, early diagnosis and management are critical to improve patient outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality. This article highlighted the importance of considering JD in the differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in patients with concurrent colon diverticulosis in which the bleeding source remains unidentified. Therefore, current challenges in JD are better understanding the etiopathology and optimal management strategies."

    "abstract": "Neonatal intestinal obstruction (NIO) is a critical surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality, particularly in resource-limited settings. This study aims to evaluate the predictors, treatment modalities, and outcomes of NIO in neonates admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at the Department of Pediatric Surgery, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh, from July 2017 to October 2018. Data were collected from 60 neonates diagnosed with NIO through detailed clinical evaluations, laboratory investigations and imaging studies. Treatment modalities included surgical interventions and conservative management, with outcomes analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The majority of neonates (71.67%) were aged between 2-5 days, with a male predominance (66.67%). Anorectal malformation (45%) and Hirschsprung's disease (26.67%) were the most common causes of NIO. Surgical interventions were predominant, with pelvic colostomy (26.67%) and anoplasty (18.33%) being the most frequently performed procedures. Morbidity was observed in 71.67% of cases, while mortality occurred in 23.33%. Low birth weight (p<0.05), delayed presentation (p<0.05), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p<0.05), and sepsis (p<0.05) were significantly associated with mortality. Early treatment (within 72 hours) showed a trend toward better survival, though not statistically significant (p>0.05). The study highlights low birth weight, delayed presentation, sepsis and elevated CRP levels as key predictors of adverse outcomes in neonates with NIO. Timely diagnosis, early intervention, and improved perioperative care are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Regional healthcare improvements are crucial for optimizing neonatal outcomes in resource-limited settings."

    "abstract": "Emergency abdominal surgery is associated with high rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality. A structured classification system for emergency surgery may help prioritize cases more effectively, reducing delays to the operating room and postoperative complications. This study evaluates the impact of a locally implemented classification for emergency abdominal surgery on postoperative complications. A before-and-after study was conducted in a University Hospital and included patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery over two 6-month periods: before (September 2019 to March 2020) and after (June 2023 to December 2023) the implementation of a surgical emergency classification. The classification, developed by a panel of local experts, assigned an ideal time to surgery (iTTS) based on five urgency grades. Propensity score-weighted analysis was used to adjust for confounding factors. The endpoint was the occurrence of major postoperative complications within 30 days. A total of 438 patients were analyzed (219 before and 219 after implementation). Excess iTTS measured by the actual time to surgery (aTTS)/iTTS ratio and postoperative complications (respiratory, infectious, digestive, cardiac) as well as acute kidney injury were significantly lower in the post-implementation group (p <  0.05). After inverse probability weighting (IPW), the risk of postoperative complications was significantly associated with the implementation of classification, with a relative risk of 0.40 [95% CI, 0.19-0.85], P < 0.001. This study shows that the implementation of a classification of emergency abdominal surgery could reduce the rate of postoperative complications probably by reducing the delay to surgery."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Acute scrotal pain in children and adolescents requires prompt evaluation to differentiate testicular torsion from other scrotal pathologies. Testicular torsion, a surgical emergency, can lead to irreversible testicular damage if not managed rapidly. This study aims to assess the clinical signs, diagnostic tools, and outcomes related to testicular torsion in patients presenting with acute scrotal pain. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 111 patients diagnosed with acute scrotal conditions. Clinical signs, presentation times, ultrasound findings, and treatment outcomes (surgical intervention, orchiectomy, or medical management) were evaluated. The statistical analysis was performed with a p-value < 0.05 being considered significant. Correlations between clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, and treatment modalities were assessed. Results: The most prevalent clinical signs were scrotal swelling (92.2%), pain on palpation (93.5%), and scrotal hyperemia (84.4%). Testicular torsion was strongly associated with the absence of the cremasteric reflex (p < 0.0001) and testicular retraction (p < 0.0001). Ultrasound findings, including absent blood flow and testicular heterogeneity, were highly predictive of surgical intervention (p < 0.01). Patients presenting within 8 h of symptom onset had higher success rates of detorsion and testicular preservation. Conclusions: Timely and accurate clinical assessment, including the identification of key signs such as the absence of the cremasteric reflex and testicular retraction, is critical for differentiating testicular torsion from other conditions. Ultrasound findings are pivotal in guiding treatment decisions in cases of clinical uncertainty. Early intervention significantly improves testicular viability and outcomes, underscoring the importance of rapid diagnosis and management."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is a common yet diagnostically challenging presentation in pediatric emergency care due to nonspecific symptoms. While ultrasound offers a safe and accessible diagnostic tool, its clinical utility and correlation with laboratory markers remain understudied in many regions, including Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and diagnostic value of ultrasound findings and their association with clinical and laboratory indicators. This cross-sectional study included 174 children aged 5-18 years who presented with acute abdominal pain to the emergency department of Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, between 2021 and 2022. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory results, and ultrasound findings were recorded. Associations between sonographic abnormalities and clinical/laboratory parameters were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. Ultrasound revealed abnormal findings in 59 (33.9%) patients. The most common sonographic diagnoses were abdominal free fluid (7.5%), appendicitis (4.6%), renal stones (2.9%), and intestinal obstruction (2.9%). Right lower quadrant pain and elevated CRP levels (> 20 mg/L) were significantly associated with appendicitis (p = 0.018 and p = 0.012, respectively). Positive urine protein and blood were significantly associated with renal stones (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003). The majority (79.3%) of ultrasounds were normal, highlighting the role of clinical assessment in determining the necessity of imaging. Ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool in pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain, identifying both common and rare conditions. The study highlights the importance of clinical assessment in determining the need for further imaging and the necessity of localized research to inform diagnostic protocols in regional healthcare settings."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency in pediatric patients, yet its diagnosis remains challenging due to variable clinical presentations and the overlap with other causes of abdominal pain. Predictive scores can enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce unnecessary surgeries, and optimize resource utilization, especially in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to identify key predictive factors for acute appendicitis in children and to develop a combined clinical and biological scoring system to enhance diagnostic accuracy for this condition. We prospectively enrolled children aged 2 to 14 years presenting with abdominal pain to the pediatric surgery department at Fattouma Bourguiba University Hospital over a one-year period. Clinical, biological, and sonographic data were analyzed to identify key predictive factors and derive a predictive scoring model for acute appendicitis in this population. Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) on the same dataset used for model derivation. Among 420 children presenting with abdominal pain, 91 (21.7%) were diagnosed with AA. The median age of the children was 7 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.48. Binary logistic regression identified the following predictive factors: right iliac fossa tenderness, right iliac fossa guarding, positive right single-leg hop, and neutrophil percentage ≥ 75%. The predictive model achieved an AUC of 0.901 (95% CI [0.85–0.93]) with a significance of P < 0.0001. The optimal cut-off for the model was 5, yielding a sensitivity of 61.04%, specificity of 95.38%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 76.4%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.5%. Stratified management strategies based on the score were proposed to guide clinical decision-making effectively. The developed predictive score offers a simple, practical, and highly specific tool for diagnosing AA in pediatric emergencies. Its integration of functional signs, such as the right-sided single-leg hop test, enhances clinical utility, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings. Further validations are warranted to confirm its generalizability and reliability. Not applicable. II"

    "abstract": "There is currently little evidence to guide the management of ventricular-peritoneal shunts during subsequent intraperitoneal procedures, and the influence of these procedures on the risk of shunt malfunction is poorly understood. A ten-year single institution retrospective analysis was undertaken to identify all paediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Statewide electronic medical records were reviewed to determine whether the patient had undergone any subsequent intraperitoneal procedures, and if so, how the shunt was managed during the procedure. Intraperitoneal procedures were divided into elective and emergency categories. Shunt survival was compared with patients not undergoing subsequent intraperitoneal procedures in time-dependent univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 1084 shunt-related procedures were performed in 472 patients, of which 45 patients underwent elective and 15 patients underwent emergency intraperitoneal procedures during a mean follow-up of 4.85 years. The most common elective procedures were considered 'clean' procedures-gastrostomies 17 (38%) and hernia repairs 13 (29%), in addition to 8 (18%) 'clean-contaminated' colostomy or colectomy procedures. No significant association of elective intraperitoneal procedures with earlier shunt failure was found on univariate or multivariate analysis (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.57-2.44, p = 0.66). Of patients presenting with an acute abdomen requiring surgical intervention, 4/15 (27%) were secondary to shunt infection, which increases to 4/6 (66%) in those without a clear preoperative alternative diagnosis. The performance of an elective intra-peritoneal procedure on a patient with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ does not appear to increase the risk of subsequent shunt malfunction."

She underwent two manual uterine evacuations at a regional hospital, and histopathology confirmed a complete hydatidiform mole. She was referred to a gestational trophoblastic disease reference center with severe pelvic pain and persistent vomiting for two days, refractory to analgesics. On admission, she exhibited signs of peritoneal irritation. Ultrasound revealed the presence of theca-lutein cysts in the left ovary and torsion of the right ovary. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed adnexal torsion and necrosis, requiring right salpingo-oophorectomy. Postoperative recovery was favorable, and serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels normalized after nine months of follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering ovarian torsion as a possible complication in patients with molar pregnancy presenting with acute abdominal symptoms. Timely imaging is crucial for diagnosis and may allow conservative management, although adnexectomy remains necessary in cases of established necrosis. Awareness of this rare but serious complication is essential for prompt diagnosis and preservation of reproductive potential."

    "abstract": "Obstructed colon cancer (OCC) accounts for approximately 25% of colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis and represents a surgical emergency creating a dual challenge: (i) the management of an acute mechanical colonic obstruction with potentially life-threatening consequences (fluid and electrolyte disturbances, systemic deterioration, colonic ischemia, stercoral stasis); and (ii) the treatment of an advanced primary or metastatic malignancy, often in elderly or frail patients with significant comorbidities. For right-sided OCC, right hemicolectomy with or without ileocolic anastomosis is the recommended approach, while a primary diverting ileostomy as a bridge to delayed right colectomy may be considered a safe alternative. For left-sided OCC, a diverting colostomy allows for subsequent oncological colectomy following complete disease staging and patient optimization. Hartmann's procedure should be reserved for perforated OCC, whereas (sub)total colectomy is indicated in cases of proximal colonic ischemia. In the setting of ischemia or perforation of a markedly distended proximal colon, a bowel-preserving (or colonic-sparing) strategy consisting of ileocecal resection with ileocolostomy - temporarily leaving the primary tumor in situ - may represent an alternative to (sub)total colectomy. Colonic stenting can be considered as an alternative to diverting colostomy in experienced centers. Given the poor prognosis of OCC and the high morbidity of emergency surgery - which may delay or even preclude adjuvant chemotherapy - novel treatment strategies are warranted. These include the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy during the interval between creation of a diverting stoma (ileostomy or colostomy) or colonic stent placement and subsequent elective colectomy, regardless of the primary tumor location."

It contributes significantly to maternal mortality and morbidity. Uterine perforation is one of the major consequences that can occur while performing the procedure under unsafe conditions by unqualified personnel. It becomes a surgical emergency when bowel prolapses through the vaginal introitus. We present a case of a 35-year-old lady with bowel without its mesentery prolapsing through her vagina following a procedure of suction and evacuation for incomplete abortion. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy with segmental resection of the degloved large bowel from the cecum to the rectosigmoid junction. The distal healthy stump, located at the rectosigmoid junction, was closed primarily, and the ileum was divided at the ileocecal region (ICR) and brought out as a permanent end ileostomy, and primary closure of the uterine perforation was done. It is advised to manage it using a multidisciplinary approach. To raise awareness of these deadly complications and recognize high-risk and challenging cases, training programs must be organized."

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare access, potentially leading to more severe presentations of AA. This study assesses the pandemic's impact on the severity and outcomes of AA. Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed patients diagnosed with AA at the American British Cowdray Medical Center from November 2019 to July 2020. The patients were categorized into pre-pandemic (before March 23, 2020) and post-pandemic (after March 24, 2020) groups. Demographics, laboratory findings, intraoperative classification with American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grades I-V, histopathology, and duration of hospital stay were compared. Results Of the 192 patients included in the study, 119 were in the pre-pandemic group and 73 in the post-pandemic group. Although the post-pandemic group had longer symptom duration before hospital admission, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.1078). However, the post-pandemic group had significantly more cases of complicated appendicitis (p=0.0012) and perforated appendicitis (p=0.0171). Histopathological analysis showed that post-pandemic patients were 1.8 times more likely to have complicated appendicitis (OR=1.8, 95% CI:1.3-2.6). The duration of hospital stay remained similar between groups (p=0.2957). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic led to delayed AA presentation and increased disease severity. Public health measures should stress the importance of prompt medical evaluation to prevent complications. Further studies are needed to explore additional factors influencing delays in surgical emergencies."

It is most often associated with prior abdominal surgery or laxity of anatomical attachments. We describe a diagnostically challenging case of a 21-year-old man with spastic cerebral palsy and no history of abdominal surgery who presented with classical features of large bowel obstruction. CT imaging revealed a whirlpool sign at the splenic flexure, suggestive of volvulus. However, an emergency colonoscopy showed no evidence of torsion or mucosal ischemia. Because the patient was a poor surgical candidate, he was managed conservatively. Remarkably, his symptoms resolved, and he was discharged on day five of admission. Although rare, SFV should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, particularly in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. Diagnostic uncertainty and delays in management may compromise patient outcomes.

This case series highlights an uncommon etiology of small bowel obstruction(SBO), with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges, surgical management, and patient outcomes. We report three cases of SBO due to faecolith impaction: two geriatric and one pediatric patient. All presented with symptoms of abdominal distention, colicky pain, and failure to pass stool. Imaging, particularly contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen and pelvis revealed dilated small bowel loops with transition point and intraluminal hyperdense masses suggestive of faecolith-induced SBO, including one case of secondary small bowel obstruction due to a caecal faecolith. Emergency Surgical interventions included enterotomy in two cases and cecotomy in one, with one patient requiring a loop ileostomy due to bowel edema. All patients recovered uneventfully and were discharged between postoperative day (POD) 5 to 8. Faecolith-induced SBO is an uncommon but important differential diagnosis, particularly in patients with no prior history of abdominal surgery. In such case early imaging with CECT is crucial for diagnosis. Timely and appropriate surgical intervention results in excellent outcomes and helps prevent complications such as ischemia or perforation. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for faecolith-induced SBO in patients with typical features of bowel obstruction but no history of prior abdominal surgery. Prompt diagnosis and operative management can lead to favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "A strangulated inguinal hernia is a common surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Patient delay in seeking treatment is a critical factor that increases surgical complexity and worsens prognosis. A 59-year-old male presented with a two-hour history of acute, excruciating pain in his left scrotum and signs of bowel obstruction. He had a two-year history of a neglected, reducible inguinoscrotal hernia. Examination revealed a strangulated hernia with systemic signs of distress, including severe hypertension (170/120 mmHg) and tachycardia (119 bpm). Emergency surgery confirmed a strangulated left inguinal hernia containing congested ileal loops and dense adhesions resulting from the chronic nature of the hernia. The bowel was successfully preserved after meticulous adhesiolysis, and a Lichtenstein mesh repair was performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Patient delay is the primary determinant of morbidity in strangulated hernias. The chronic presence of the hernia led to the formation of dense adhesions, significantly increasing the surgical complexity and operative risk compared to an elective repair. The management highlights the critical intraoperative assessment of bowel viability and the nuanced decision to use prosthetic mesh in a potentially contaminated field, aligning with current guidelines when bowel resection is not required. The case underscores that neglecting a hernia transforms a low-risk condition into a life-threatening emergency. Neglecting an inguinal hernia leads to preventable, life-threatening complications. This case emphasizes the critical importance of patient education to promote timely elective surgery to prevent the significant morbidity and mortality associated with strangulated hernias."

We present a case of a 4-year-old female who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of appendicitis, including right iliac fossa pain, vomiting, and fever. Imaging studies were inconclusive, and a laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. No signs of appendicitis were found, but vasculitic changes were noted in a segment of the ileum. Postoperatively, the patient developed a mild purpuric rash, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels prompted further investigation. Subsequent laboratory tests and clinical findings led to a diagnosis of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, characterized by a small-vessel vasculitis affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges when presenting symptoms mimic appendicitis but are ultimately attributed to an atypical presentation of IgA vasculitis. The importance of considering systemic inflammatory conditions like IgA vasculitis in pediatric abdominal pain is emphasized, especially when initial diagnoses do not align with imaging or surgical findings. A multidisciplinary approach, including rheumatological evaluation, was crucial in securing the correct diagnosis and managing the patient's care. IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is a condition that causes inflammation of small blood vessels. It can often affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and digestive system. This condition usually involves the upper part of the small intestine, but in rare cases, it can affect the very end of the small intestine (terminal ileum). In our case, a patient came to the hospital with sudden, severe abdominal pain and imaging that suggested a localized bowel problem. Surgeons operated urgently, and only later (when a skin rash appeared) IgAV was diagnosed. The patient recovered quickly after starting steroid treatment, without needing further bowel procedures. This case shows that IgAV can sometimes look like a surgical emergency. By being aware of this possibility, we can prevent unnecessary surgery and guide treatment decisions."

    "abstract": "To present a case of intestinal nonrotation in a 26-year-old Indian male and conduct a detailed review of 16 additional cases from the PubMed database. A 26-year-old male presented with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain and vomiting. He had a similar episode seven years prior that self-resolved. Physical examination revealed generalized abdominal tenderness, guarding, and mild distention. Imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasound and CECT, confirmed midgut volvulus due to nonrotation. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and Ladd's procedure, leading to an uneventful recovery and discharge on postoperative day seven. A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted for case reports on midgut nonrotation in adults. 15 relevant cases were selected, and including the present case, 16 cases were reviewed. The mean age at presentation was 55.19 years (range: 26-86), with a slight male predominance (56.2%). The most common symptoms were acute abdominal pain (50%) and vomiting (31.25%). Notably, 50% of cases were identified incidentally during evaluations for unrelated conditions or procedures. CT scans confirmed diagnoses in 87.5% of cases. Positional anomalies included right-sided small bowel and left-sided colon in 37.5% and reversed SMA/SMV relationships in 33%. Ladd's procedure was performed in 25% of cases. Midgut nonrotation, resulting from abnormal embryonic bowel rotation, can occur at any age, more commonly in males. It may present as a surgical emergency due to bowel obstruction and volvulus or remain asymptomatic throughout life. CT imaging and surgical intervention, particularly Ladd's procedure, are effective management strategies. The frequent incidental discovery of cases suggests that asymptomatic nonrotation may be more prevalent than clinically recognized."

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether the appropriateness of imaging requests (AIR) for acute abdominal pain (AAP) in two private hospitals in Santiago (2023) was associated with higher diagnostic yield, and to explore predictors through a multivariable model. A retrospective cross-sectional study included patients aged ≥ 15 years presenting with AAP who underwent US, CT, or MRI. AIR was classified according to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, and radiology reports were categorized as confirmatory or normal. A multivariable logistic regression model, incorporating interactions between AIR, imaging modality, and age, was applied to identify predictors of diagnostic yield. A total of 189 imaging studies were analyzed (75 US, 62 CT, 52 MRI). Overall, 57.7% of requests were appropriate. Confirmatory findings occurred in 66.1% of cases, significantly more frequent in appropriate requests (84.4%) than in inappropriate ones (41.3%; p < 0.01). Inappropriateness reduced diagnostic yield from 78.3% to 17.4% in US and from 91.5% to 25.9% in CT, with no significant difference for MRI (86% vs. 81.3%). Older age was independently associated with higher probabilities of confirmatory findings. Epigastric pain and acute gastroenteritis were disproportionately linked to overuse, while hepatobiliary conditions showed predominantly appropriate use. The model demonstrated high discriminatory performance (AUC = 0.88). Adherence to ACR criteria was strongly associated with improved diagnostic yield in AAP, particularly for CT and US. Age and local epidemiology, including high biliary disease prevalence, influenced modality performance. These findings support context-sensitive decision-support tools and prospective studies to refine imaging strategies and enhance patient safety in emergency care."

    "abstract": "Acute airway obstruction secondary to a massive multinodular goiter represents a rare but critical surgical emergency, often occurring in patients with long-neglected thyroid disease. We report on an 85-year-old female who presented at Emergency County Hospital Tg Mures in March 2025 in critical respiratory distress, with documented tracheal deviation, orthopnea, and multiple episodes of cardiorespiratory arrest. Clinical and radiologic assessment revealed a giant anterior cervical mass with retrosternal extension and near-complete tracheal compression. Emergency airway control was achieved via awake fiberoptic intubation, followed by urgent total thyroidectomy. Intraoperative findings included significant tracheomalacia, prompting the need for concurrent tracheostomy. Postoperatively, the patient required intensive care monitoring and developed two systemic complications, a right hemispheric ischemic stroke and acute limb ischemia, both of which were managed conservatively. Histopathological analysis confirmed a benign multinodular goiter. This case emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition and surgical intervention in life-threatening compressive goiter, particularly in elderly patients, to prevent airway collapse and optimize outcomes."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (M.D.) is the most frequent congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. Inverted Meckel's diverticulum is a rare clinical condition, and intussusception caused by M.D. inversion is even more uncommon. We present a case report of an inverted Meckel's diverticulum with associated lipoma as a cause of unexplained anemia and acute intestinal obstruction in a young man, and a brief literature review. The patient presented to the emergency room with acute abdomen. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed ileo-ileal intussusception with a suspected intraluminal lipoma. Surgical resection of the intussuscepted ileal segment was performed, with an uneventful postoperative course. Histopathology showed an inverted Meckel's diverticulum with a lipoma associated. Inversion of a Meckel Diverticulum with an associated lipoma causing intussusception is extremely uncommon, and emergency abdominal surgeon could face it in differential diagnosis and treatment of acute abdomen. Surgical resection with primary anastomosis is the treatment of choice of this rare finding, with a high percentage of good results."

    "abstract": "This case report addresses an unusual etiology of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain in an elderly patient. While acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, especially among young people, older patients may exhibit atypical symptoms that conceal a more severe pathology. The main objective of this article is to highlight the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic implications of cecal adenocarcinoma that mimics acute appendicitis. We describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, intraoperative findings, and postoperative course of a 74-year-old female patient who had symptoms compatible with acute appendicitis. Despite preoperative imaging indicating appendicitis, the surgical investigation revealed a cecal tumor, prompting a right hemicolectomy. The initial investigation revealed localized RLQ pain and leukocytosis, along with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies indicated retrocecal inflammation and cecal distention. The intraoperative evaluation revealed a grossly normal appendix but a firm cecal mass. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed a moderately differentiated cecal adenocarcinoma classified as pT3N0Mx. The patient's recovery went smoothly, and she was discharged on postoperative day 7 with an oncology referral. Cecal carcinoma can manifest as acute appendicitis in elderly patients, necessitating a high level of suspicion and careful intraoperative evaluation. Prompt conversion to definitive oncologic surgery, as proven, enables correct diagnosis and timely treatment. Surgeons should be extra cautious, especially in patients over 40, and perform appropriate postoperative screening in search of underlying malignancies."

    "abstract": "Ovarian tumors are quite uncommon in the premenarchal age group, with the majority being functional cysts. Malignant tumors are unusual in this age group, making the diagnosis of ovarian malignancy in children quite challenging. Dysgerminoma is the most common malignant ovarian germ cell tumor in females. The clinical symptoms often include abdominal pain, distension, a palpable mass, reduced appetite, nausea, and vomiting. We discuss the case of an 11-year-old premenarchal girl who was brought to the emergency department with abdominal pain persisting for 3-4 days, which had intensified over the 24 hours before she arrived at the emergency department. The pain was accompanied by vomiting. On examination, her lower abdomen showed tenderness, guarding, and rigidity, and a firm mass approximately 10 x 8 cm in size was palpable in the midline. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large hypoechoic mass lesion, approximately 99 x 56 x 92 mm, in the right adnexa. A magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis was performed for confirmation, which substantiated the diagnosis of the right ovarian lesion with torsion. Following the patient's exploratory laparotomy, a right salpingo-oophorectomy and left oophoropexy were performed. The histopathological report confirmed the diagnosis of dysgerminoma. Malignant ovarian tumors are quite rare in the premenarchal age group, and the primary goal should be to offer fertility-preserving surgeries. This allows the individual to retain reproductive functions. However, close monitoring is essential, and if needed, radical surgery should be considered to save the patient's life."

    "abstract": "Perforated duodenal ulcer is a surgical emergency associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While open repair has long been the standard, laparoscopic repair is increasingly adopted for its minimally invasive advantages. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251117651), compared outcomes of laparoscopic versus open repair in adult patients with perforated duodenal ulcers. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library identified comparative studies published between January 2000 and December 2024. Six studies involving 739 patients met the inclusion criteria. Outcomes assessed included operative time, conversion rate, length of hospital stay (LOS), post-operative complications, leak rate, and mortality. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB-2) tool for the single randomized controlled trial and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Laparoscopic repair was consistently associated with shorter LOS (4.0-7.8 versus 7.8-11.7 days), lower complication rates (5.8-13% versus 8.6-44.3%), and reduced mortality (0-1.8% versus 0-27.9%) compared with open repair, while leak rates were comparable (0-7% versus 1.4-4.9%). Conversion to open surgery occurred in 0-17.8% of laparoscopic cases. Operative times were longer in earlier studies but equivalent or shorter in more recent work. Risk of bias ranged from low to moderate. In conclusion, laparoscopic repair is a safe and effective alternative to open repair, offering a faster recovery and lower morbidity without increasing the risk of leaks. Open repair remains essential for unstable patients or those with severe contamination. Further multicentre randomized trials with standardized outcome reporting are warranted to confirm these benefits and define optimal patient selection."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the commonest surgical emergency, yet its presentation can be atypical, often resembling non-urgent conditions. Delayed or missed diagnosis of appendicitis carries not only clinical risk but also significant legal exposure. Retrospective analyses of malpractice claims have long identified appendicitis as one of the top causes of emergency department malpractice suits. This article explores the medicolegal landscape surrounding appendicitis, highlighting common diagnostic errors, the transformative impact of widespread computed tomography (CT) use, and recent verdicts. It also examines the key legal principles involved in such cases, with a focus on how diagnostic uncertainty and communication breakdowns in the emergency department (ED) affect radiologists. Finally, we emphasize the radiologist's duty to clearly report imaging findings and to ensure critical results are communicated to the treating clinician, using a closed-loop communication system. Ultimately, both radiologists and emergency providers must stay alert to the varied manifestations of appendicitis and follow established imaging and follow-up protocols to enhance patient care and mitigate medicolegal exposure."

    "abstract": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumour derived from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, derived from embryonic neural crest cells. Pheochromocytoma affects approximately 0.3 %-0.6 % of the hypertensive population. Most cases of pheochromocytomas are sporadic, but they may also be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia Type II, von Hippel Lindau Syndrome, and less commonly with Neurofibromatosis Type 1. If symptomatic, the clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma is highly variable. The classic presentation of pheochromocytoma involves the triad of paroxysmal headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis accompanied by marked hypertension. However, pheochromocytoma may rupture either spontaneously or following trauma and mimic surgical emergencies, including acute abdomen and haemorrhagic shock, that may be lethal if not diagnosed promptly. The proper treatment of ruptured pheochromocytoma is elective adrenalectomy after medical or interventional patient stabilization. Emergency adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Emergency adrenalectomy can be complicated by circulatory shock due to excess catecholamine release, cardiomyopathy and adult respiratory distress syndrome."

    "abstract": "Perforated diverticulitis is a critical surgical emergency that demands immediate attention and intervention. Damage control surgery (DCS) has emerged as an alternative to traditional approaches for managing physiologically unstable and critically ill patients. This systematic review includes 16 articles published between 2015 and 2025, covering randomized controlled trials, observational cohorts, case reports, and guidelines. The inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on human studies published in English that addressed managing perforated diverticulitis with DCS. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines were used to guide article selection, which was further refined using standardized appraisal tools such as A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), Joanna Briggs Institute Checklists (JBI), the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool, the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II), and the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES). This review highlights DCS as an effective approach for managing perforated diverticulitis. Patient management with DCS showed significant improvement compared to traditional methods such as Hartmann's procedure. Physiological stabilization reduced complications such as stoma formation and improved anastomosis rates, as supported by the included studies. The findings suggest that DCS reduces morbidity and mortality, lowers the need for a stoma, and enhances bowel continuity in patients with perforated diverticulitis. Several studies also employed negative pressure therapy for temporary abdominal closure. The main prognostic factors identified were ongoing peritonitis and hemodynamic instability, which characterize critically ill patients. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing patient stability and controlling disease severity at the outset, before proceeding to definitive therapy once the patient is stable. Further high-quality, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes are needed to develop standardized treatment guidelines."

However, the coexistence of hernias and colon neoplasm is a rare finding, one that is usually identified intraoperatively. In addition, there is no consensus on the best treatment route. We present a case of an 86-year-old male who presented in an emergency setting with an initial diagnosis of intestinal obstruction and an incarcerated left inguinal hernia. Upon exploratory laparotomy, the content was discovered to be an obstructed sigmoid colon due to a sigmoid colon neoplasm."

    "abstract": "Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is an abdominal emergency with high mortality, the confirmation of which usually relies on computed tomography, a resource unavailable in many second‑level hospitals in Mexico. We report a case of a 37‑year‑old man with no prior comorbidities and a four‑year history of chronic methamphetamine use who presented with diffuse abdominal pain of 10 days' duration, fever, and incipient shock. Plain abdominal radiography demonstrated massive colonic distention. As computed tomography was unavailable and signs of peritoneal irritation were present, urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing patchy transmural necrosis of the entire colon with viable small bowel. Total colectomy and ileostomy were undertaken. Despite intensive vasopressor support, the patient died of refractory vasoplegic shock. This case underscores that NOMI secondary to methamphetamine use can occur in young patients and rapidly progress to massive colonic necrosis. It also highlights the need to maintain a high index of suspicion and proceed to early surgical exploration when the clinical scenario warrants it, even in settings with limited diagnostic resources, to avoid fatal delays."

We report the case of a 94-year-old Hispanic woman brought to the emergency department presenting with an acute abdomen. On physical examination, a tense, tender mass was seen in her left inguinal region, initially suspected as an incarcerated inguinal hernia. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed that this mass corresponded to a Nuck cyst. An encapsulated abscess adjacent to a jejunal segment and pneumoperitoneum were also seen, prompting an emergency surgical intervention. Intraoperative findings included a perforated diverticulum in the distal jejunum, as well as extensive diverticulosis involving the ileum and left colon. Resection and anastomosis were performed. Small bowel diverticulitis remains challenging to diagnose preoperatively, and more so in an elderly patient. This case report highlights the role of imaging in discerning among the differential diagnosis for acute abdomen in the elderly patients. It also demonstrates how rare pathologies, such as the Nuck cyst, could masquerade a different etiology and hinder its diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency worldwide. Obtaining a correct diagnosis and timely management can be challenging even in modern medicine. Hence, appendicitis is still considered a \"high-risk\" diagnosis for litigation and claims of malpractice. Few studies have investigated the pattern and outcome of claims for appendicitis in a contemporary universal health care system. The aim of this study is to analyze compensation claims related to the investigation and treatment of appendicitis in Norway. An observational study based on claims from the Norwegian System of Patient Injury Compensation (NPE) from 2005 to 2023. Population rates of appendicitis treatment were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR; data from 2016 to 2023) and Statistics Norway (SSB). Altogether 207 compensation claims were filed for appendicitis and 56 (27%) received compensation. The probability of receiving compensation was not influenced by age, gender, or geographical location. The most common reasons for compensation granted were delayed diagnosis (n = 25, 45%) and delayed treatment (n = 5, 9%). The most common reasons for the 151 (73%) denied claims were predictable complication (n = 48, 32%) and condition caused by an unrelated disease (n = 40, 26%). Out of the 59,450 appendectomies performed, 96 claims were filed to NPE, giving a claim rate of 0.16% or 1 claim for every 620 appendectomies. For the entire study period, there was a total payout of 27.2 mill NOK (approximately 2.4 mill EUR) with a mean of 460,000 NOK (approximately 40,000 EUR) and a median of 75,000 NOK (approximately 6,600 EUR) per claim. In acute appendicitis, about a quarter of claims are compensated due to malpractice. More than half of the approved claims involved delays in diagnosis or treatment, which can be related to the clinical challenges of diagnosing appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common pediatric surgical emergency worldwide. Misdiagnosis and perforation remain frequent, particularly among younger children in low- and middle-income countries. Prior studies have explored healthcare access or caregiving structures separately, but few long-term, large-sample retrospective studies in resource-limited settings have assessed their combined impact. We retrospectively analyzed 1839 children (0-14 years) undergoing appendectomy at a tertiary hospital in southwestern China (2008-2017). Exposures included initial healthcare facility level (tertiary vs non-tertiary) and caregiving structure (biparental, single-parent, non-parental). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated predictors of misdiagnosis and perforation, adjusting for age, sex, year, and imaging. Phi coefficient assessed correlation between misdiagnosis and perforation. All key findings were validated in an independent external 2018cohort. Nomograms were subsequently constructed based on significant predictors identified in the primary cohort. Initial presentation to non-tertiary facilities was associated with higher odds of misdiagnosis (aOR 2.39, 95 % CI 1.89-3.02) and perforation (aOR 2.97, 95 % CI 2.38-3.72). Non-biparental caregiving increased the risk of diagnostic error and complications: single-parent caregiving (misdiagnosis: aOR 2.57; perforation: aOR 2.54), non-parental caregiving (misdiagnosis: aOR 5.26; perforation: aOR 2.94). A significant interaction between non-parental caregiving and non-tertiary healthcare increased risks of misdiagnosis (OR 7.52) and perforation (OR 8.19). Younger age, particularly 0-3 years, was the strongest predictor. Additionally, lack of imaging was independently associated with increased risk of both misdiagnosis (aOR 1.78, 95 % CI 1.34-2.36) and perforation (aOR 2.06, 95 % CI 1.50-2.83). Misdiagnosis and perforation were moderately correlated (ϕ = 0.352). These findings were statistically significant and validated in an external cohort. Younger age, no imaging, non-traditional caregiving, and lower-level initial healthcare independently and interactively contribute to misdiagnosis and perforation in pediatric appendicitis."

These include common presentations such as acute appendicitis, ureteric colic, and pancreatitis. With the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension, the clinical profile and complexity of these emergencies are increasing. To analyze the clinical spectrum, diagnostic patterns, management strategies, and outcomes of non-traumatic abdominal emergencies in a tertiary care setting. This prospective observational study was conducted over 18 months in a tertiary care hospital and included 103 adult patients diagnosed with NTAEs. Data on demographics, comorbidities, diagnosis, time of presentation, mode of treatment, and hospital stay were analyzed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Among the 103 patients, 64 (62.1%) were males and 39 (37.9%) females. A total of 88 patients (85.4%) presented within 72 hours of symptom onset. The most common diagnoses were ureteric colic (n = 20, 19.4%), acute appendicitis (n = 15, 14.6%), and acute pancreatitis (n = 10, 9.7%). Conservative management was sufficient in 76 patients (73.8%), while 27 patients (26.2%) underwent surgical intervention. Comorbidities included diabetes mellitus in 31 patients (30.1%), hypertension in 29 (28.2%), and obesity in 33 (32.0%). Surgical intervention was significantly associated with male gender (p = 0.03) and older age (p = 0.01). Surgical patients had a longer mean hospital stay (6.07 ± 1.4 days) compared to non-surgical patients (5.8 ± 1.2 days), which was statistically significant (p = 0.004, t = 2.96). Imaging modalities such as ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and influenced treatment decisions in over 90% of cases. Early recognition and timely imaging are pivotal in the management of NTAEs. Individualized treatment based on imaging and clinical findings is essential. Conservative management remains appropriate for most cases; however, prompt surgical referral should be considered for patients who are older, male, or have severe pathology, as these are significantly associated with the need for surgical intervention. Strengthening diagnostic pathways and enhancing early triage protocols may further improve outcomes in tertiary care settings."

A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who presented with acute abdominal symptoms to the emergency department between January 1, 2013 and May 30, 2023, and underwent abdominopelvic CT scans in the acute setting. Among this cohort, 149 patients had repeat abdominopelvic CT scans during the same admission and were classified into five groups based on findings: Group A (no change in diagnosis), Group B (confirmation of suspected initial diagnosis), Group C (disease progression), Group D (disease regression), and Group E (new diagnosis). The mean age of the cohort was 51.5+-18 years (range: 19-92). The average interval between initial and repeat CT scans was 40.9+-59.05 hours (range: 0.5-238). The number of patients in each group was as follows: Group A (n=21), Group B (n=60), Group C (n=32), Group D (n=25), and Group E (n=11).

The \"wait and follow-up\" approach significantly guided management decisions for partial bowel obstruction (p<0.01). This study emphasizes the importance of the \"wait and repeat CT\" strategy in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and guiding clinical management for patients with acute non-traumatic abdominal complaints. Follow-up CT scans were particularly effective in identifying conditions such as partial bowel obstruction."

This single-center retrospective cohort study included 500 consecutive patients aged ≥65 years who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography in the emergency department owing to acute abdominal pain between 2013 and 2014. Imaging data were retrospectively evaluated by a consultant interventional radiologist for 50% or greater stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), celiac artery (CA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The main outcomes of interest were the prevalence of atherosclerotic mesenteric artery stenosis in patients with acute abdominal pain, the prevalence of AMI in patients with mesenteric artery stenosis, and later presentation of mesenteric ischemia until the end of the follow-up, August 2025. Altogether, 123 patients (25%) had a mesenteric artery stenosis.

There were 14 patients (2.8%) with isolated 50% to 69% stenosis of the SMA of whom none had AMI at presentation; 9 patients (1.8%) had isolated ≥70% SMA stenosis of whom 2 (22%) presented with AMI. Of all patients with ≥70% SMA stenosis, 12 of 31 (39%) presented with AMI, and 12 of 40 (30%) with any multivessel stenosis presented with AMI. One of the patients with incidental mesenteric artery stenosis (ie, no AMI at presentation) developed symptomatic mesenteric ischemia during follow-up. Mesenteric artery stenosis is a relatively common clinical problem in elderly patients with acute abdomen. The risk of AMI is significant in emergency room patients with ≥70% SMA stenosis and involvement of other mesenteric arteries (multivessel disease). Occurrence of later symptoms seems to be rare in patients with incidental asymptomatic mesenteric artery stenosis."

    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm or abdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA/AAA) is a fatal surgical emergency, and time to surgery can be a key factor in improving survival outcomes in patients. In this study, we examined the association between systolic blood pressure on arrival and door-to-surgery time in patients with ruptured TAA/AAA, hypothesizing that patients with ruptured thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms without hypotension may have longer door-to-surgery times than those with hypotension. This retrospective study was conducted at two community hospitals, Shonan Kamakura General Hospital and Tokyo Nishi Tokushukai Hospital, in Japan, and included patients with ruptured thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms who were admitted to these hospitals from 2010 to 2021. Door-to-surgery time was compared between patients with stable blood pressure (>90 mmHg) and those with hypotension (≤90 mmHg) using multivariable linear regression. Among 94 patients (median age 82 years), 29.8% were in hypotension on arrival. Hemodynamically stable patients had a longer door-to-surgery time than those with hypotension (152 vs. 95.5 min, p = 0.003). Multivariable analysis showed significantly shorter door-to-surgery times for patients with hypotension (percent difference, -26.3%; 95% CI, -48.7% to -4.0%). Hemodynamically stable patients with ruptured TAA/AAA can have longer door-to-surgery times, leading to avoidable delays in successful treatment. This study underscores the need for heightened clinical vigilance among physicians, as a delay in treatment may lead to worse outcomes in these patients."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, typically asymptomatic but occasionally presenting with complications such as bleeding, obstruction, or rarely, perforation. Symptomatic MD is unusual in the elderly, often mimicking other acute abdominal conditions and posing diagnostic challenges, especially in low-resource settings. We report a case of a 64-year-old male presenting with a 2-day history of right iliac fossa pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical examination and laboratory findings were suggestive of perforated appendicitis. Due to the unavailability of CT imaging, an urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a perforated MD located 40 cm from the ileocecal valve. A wedge resection was conducted. Histopathological examination confirmed ischemic necrosis and ectopic gastric mucosa. The patient recovered smoothly and was discharged on postoperative Day 5. Perforation of MD is rare, particularly in elderly patients, and often leads to diagnostic confusion with more common causes of acute abdomen. In the absence of reliable imaging modalities, clinical acumen and timely surgical exploration are crucial. The presence of ectopic gastric mucosa within MD increases the risk of perforation. Surgical resection, tailored to intraoperative findings, remains the definitive treatment. This case underscores the need to consider MD in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, even in older adults. In resource-limited settings, prompt surgical intervention guided by clinical evaluation can be lifesaving and highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential to avoid missed or delayed diagnoses."

Sigmoid volvulus, an unusual but potentially catastrophic cause of major bowel obstruction, is rarely associated with Situs inversus. A 76-year-old male presented with abdominal pain and obstipation for 5 days. Clinical examination and imaging revealed signs of bowel obstruction and dextrocardia. Computed tomography (CT) scan abdomen confirmed sigmoid volvulus and situs inversus totalis. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 360-degree twisted, dilated sigmoid colon. Manual detorsion and excision of fibrous bands were performed. The patient recovered uneventfully. While sigmoid volvulus is a known surgical emergency, its diagnosis in situs inversus patients can be challenging due to reversed anatomical landmarks. Imaging plays a critical role in both diagnosis and surgical planning. Awareness of reversed anatomy in situs inversus is crucial for prompt diagnosis and successful surgical management acute abdominal conditions like volvulus."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous presentation of acute appendicitis and ovarian torsion is rare and requires urgent surgical intervention due to the high risk of complications, including sepsis and mortality. While adnexal torsion is a known cause of acute abdomen in reproductive-age women, co-presentation with appendicitis is exceptionally uncommon. This case underlines the importance of considering gynecological differentials in women presenting with acute abdominal pain. A 39-year-old woman presented with right lower abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Initially diagnosed with an appendicular lump, she was managed conservatively and discharged after symptomatic improvement. Upon recurrence of symptoms, imaging revealed an ovarian dermoid cyst with torsion. Exploratory laparotomy identified a gangrenous ovary with a twisted cyst and adherent appendix. Histopathology confirmed acute appendicitis and a benign dermoid cyst. Adnexal torsion occurs when the ovary and fallopian tube twist around their ligaments, often caused by ovarian cysts like dermoid cysts. These cysts are common in young women and can lead to acute abdominal pain, requiring urgent surgery to prevent ovarian damage. Diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms mimic other conditions like appendicitis. Imaging such as ultrasonography or computed tomography is used, and treatment involves surgical untwisting or removal of affected tissues. Torsion sometimes affects nearby organs, like an appendix. This case highlights the rare occurrence of simultaneous appendicitis and ovarian torsion, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and surgical intervention."

Vanek's tumor or inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP) is a rare benign gastrointestinal tumor. This tumor is responsible for intestinal obstructions and rarely bleeding. We report two cases of Vanek's tumor. The first was a 58-year-old woman with intestinal obstruction confirmed in computed tomography scan, the patient had an emergency laparotomy with bowel resection, the histopathological examination showed a polyp measuring 3.5 cm. The postoperative course was simple with no medico-surgical complications. The second case is a 22-year-old man with no significant pathological history who presented with colocolic intussusception and who underwent a left colectomy. Vanek's tumor is a rare tumor of the digestive tract. It is a benign tumor with no malignant potential, which can be asymptomatic or complicated by intestinal intussusception. Treatment is based on endoscopic resection when the tumor is small, or surgical resection in the case of complications. Intestinal intussusception is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in adults. IFP is a rare, benign tumor, which preferentially affects the stomach and ileum, and it can be responsible for serious complications."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency, but ileo-ileal knotting is an exceptionally rare cause in which two loops of ileum intertwine into a true knot, leading to strangulation. Preoperative diagnosis of ileo-ileal knotting is extremely challenging due to nonspecific clinical features, and most cases are identified only during emergency surgery. We present three cases of ileo-ileal knotting to illustrate varied precipitating factors, presentations, and diagnostic challenges associated with this condition. All patients underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy with resection of the knotted, nonviable bowel and primary anastomosis; each had an uneventful recovery and was discharged in good condition. Although rare, ileo-ileal knotting should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction, especially in rapidly deteriorating patients with signs of strangulation, since prompt surgical intervention is essential to prevent a fatal outcome."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency condition. Its timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial to prevent complications like perforation and abscess formation. However, distinguishing between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis can be challenging. Clinical and imaging findings are often used, but their predictive value is still debatable. The objective of the study is to identify the predictive value of clinical and computed tomography (CT) scan findings for complicated appendicitis in patients who underwent appendectomy. A retrospective analysis of data from a cohort of patients who underwent appendectomy in a tertiary governmental hospital was conducted. The study population included patients from varied demographic backgrounds, excluding those who were immunocompromised or had an appendectomy for reasons other than appendicitis. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Out of 256 patients, 57.4% were male and the majority were of Saudi origin (74.6%). A significant difference in the distribution of Alvarado scores between groups with complicated (6, IQR: 5-7) and uncomplicated appendicitis (5, IQR: 4-6) was observed. The logistic regression analysis revealed symptom duration, Alvarado score, and the presence of cecal and ileum thickness in CT scan as significant predictors for complicated appendicitis. Symptom duration, Alvarado score, and the presence of cecal and ileum thickness in CT scan are significant predictors for complicated appendicitis. Healthcare professionals should consider these predictors when assessing patients with suspected appendicitis to facilitate early identification and management of potential complications. Further research is required to validate these predictors in different populations and settings."

    "title": "Value of Early Kinetics of Procalcitonin with Point-of-Care Test to Predict Postoperative Abscess Following Non-Complicated Acute Appendicitis: A Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, and while appendectomy typically results in good outcomes, post-operative complications, like intra-abdominal abscesses, can occur. Traditional biomarkers, such as white blood cells count and C-reactive protein, often lack the accuracy needed for early detection. Procalcitonin is emerging as a potential marker for predicting post-operative infections. This pilot study evaluates the role of kinetics of procalcitonin, measured via point-of-care testing, in predicting abscess formation in patients with non-complicated appendicitis. Materials and Methods: The study involved 33 patients undergoing appendectomy for non-complicated acute appendicitis. The levels of procalcitonin were measured at four time points: pre-operatively (T0), post-operatively (T1), on the first post-operative day (T2), and at discharge (T3). The primary outcome was the development of post-operative abscesses, confirmed by imaging or intervention. Results: Four patients (12%) developed abscesses. The levels of procalcitonin were significantly higher in the abscess group at all time points compared to the non-abscess group (p < 0.05). The levels of procalcitonin in the abscess group plateaued after an initial post-operative decline, while levels steadily decreased in the non-abscess group. Conclusions: Procalcitonin, particularly its kinetic profile, may serve as a valuable early marker for predicting post-operative abscess formation. Point-of-care testing for procalcitonin can enable timely intervention, improving outcomes. Kinetics of procalcitonin show promise as a predictor for post-operative abscesses after appendectomy, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "Background: Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) remains a critical medical-surgical emergency associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden worldwide. Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, NVUGIB continues to pose complex clinical challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings. Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed 364 consecutive adult patients diagnosed with NVUGIB and hospitalized at the First Surgical Clinic of the County Emergency Clinical Hospital Craiova between January 2009 and December 2014. Inclusion criteria required a confirmed diagnosis based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE). Demographic variables, etiology, comorbidities, drug-induced triggers, laboratory parameters, onset-to-admission and onset-to-surgery intervals, endoscopic findings, therapeutic interventions (medical, endoscopic, surgical), rebleeding rates, and mortality were recorded and analyzed. Results were descriptively compared with historical data from the national and international literature. Due to the retrospective and aggregate nature of the data, survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) was not applicable. Results: Peptic ulcers, erosive gastritis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and gastric neoplasms were the predominant etiologies. NSAID use, oral anticoagulation, and alcohol consumption emerged as major risk factors. Endoscopic hemostasis was achieved in the majority of cases; surgical intervention was required in 11.5% of patients, mainly for refractory or recurrent bleeding. The overall mortality rate was 10.9%, consistent with historical benchmarks. Comparative analysis revealed trends in etiology and management reflecting evolving clinical practice standards. Conclusions: NVUGIB remains a significant clinical challenge with persistent mortality and rebleeding risks. This cohort highlights the need for timely diagnosis, risk stratification, and an evidence-based therapeutic strategy integrating modern endoscopic and surgical options. An updated diagnostic and management algorithm is proposed to guide practical decision-making and optimize outcomes in similar tertiary care settings."

    "title": "Predictors of Mortality and Modern Surgical Strategies in Intestinal Obstruction: A 200-Patient Study from a North Indian Tertiary Center.",
    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction remains a common surgical emergency associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The evolving epidemiology, emergence of postoperative adhesions as a leading cause, and adoption of modern surgical practices necessitate updated real-world analyses. A retrospective study was conducted on 200 patients who underwent surgical management for intestinal obstruction at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, India, between January 2018 and December 2023. Demographic, clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, and outcome data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Postoperative adhesions (32%) and external hernias (18%) were the most common causes of obstruction. Abdominal pain (100%), vomiting (94%), and distension (88%) were the predominant presenting symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed in 35% of cases and led to changes in surgical planning in over 60% of those patients. Surgical interventions included adhesiolysis (32%), hernia repair (18%), bowel resection with anastomosis (24%), and stoma creation (9%). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 7%. On multivariate analysis, the significant predictors of mortality were strangulated obstruction (OR 5.2, P = 0.002), delayed presentation >48 h (OR 3.8, P = 0.02), and presence of peritonitis (OR 2.9, P = 0.03). Partial enhanced recovery after surgery implementation in 48% of patients was associated with shorter hospital stay and fewer infectious complications. This large single-center study identifies the key predictors of mortality and highlights the practical role of CT imaging and enhanced recovery protocols in the surgical management of intestinal obstruction. Early referral, timely surgical intervention, and protocol-driven care are essential to improve the outcomes in resource-constrained settings.

    "title": "Improving Appendicitis Prediction in Children Using the Paediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS): A Three-Year Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis is a leading surgical emergency in children, yet diagnosis remains challenging. The Paediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) was developed to standardise risk stratification using clinical and laboratory indicators. While its diagnostic accuracy has been validated in controlled settings, its real-world application remains variable. This paper aimed to evaluate the impact of implementing PAS into routine clinical assessment at an NHS district-general hospital. The objectives were to reduce negative appendicectomy rates and improve diagnostic accuracy. Materials and methods A two-cycle retrospective audit was conducted at Southend University Hospital. Cycle 1 (August 2021-August 2024) included 156 paediatric patients who underwent appendicectomy. In August 2024, an educational intervention was introduced. It involved departmental teaching and dissemination of a quick-reference guide aligned with the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) abdominal pain pathway. Cycle 2 (August 2024-March 2025) included 34 cases. Patients under 18 years undergoing appendicectomy were included. The data collected included demographics, PAS scores, and histological outcomes. Diagnostic performance of PAS was evaluated by plotting the PAS value against the final histological outcome, using sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Results A total of 190 patients were analysed. The negative appendicectomy rate fell from 29.5% (Cycle 1) to 17.6% (Cycle 2) following the educational intervention, although this was not statistically significant (p=0.16). In the combined cohort, PAS ≥7 achieved 87% specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.89, but only 40% sensitivity. PAS ≥4 maximised sensitivity (96%) but reduced specificity (31%). Mean PAS was significantly higher in confirmed cases (6.18 vs 4.69; p < 0.001). The AUC-ROC was 0.73. Discussion Across the full cohort, PAS showed expected trade-offs: at a high threshold (≥7), the tool provided good specificity (87%) but reduced sensitivity (40%), whereas a low threshold (≥4) delivered high sensitivity (96%) but poor specificity (31%). These findings are lower than those reported in the initial derivation cohort but broadly consistent with subsequent external validation studies. The score's modest AUC-ROC (0.73) underlines the need for adjuncts such as imaging in equivocal cases. Post-intervention trends suggest improved adherence to PAS-based risk stratification and reduced avoidable surgeries, although small sample size possibly led to poor statistical power. Conclusions Integrating PAS into routine assessment improved risk stratification and reduced the negative appendicectomy rate, although without statistical significance. High scores (≥7) remained highly specific, low scores (≤3) safely ruled out disease, and mid-range scores benefited from adjuncts such as imaging or serial review. Continued use within a structured pathway is advisable, but larger multicentre studies, and the inclusion of imaging adjuncts, are recommended to refine the score and therefore improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce negative appendicectomy rates."

    "abstract": "Background Hollow viscus perforation is a surgical emergency with variable outcomes. The surgical Apgar score (SAS) offers a simple method for risk stratification, but its utility in the patient population is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the role of SAS in predicting postoperative complications in patients undergoing surgery for hollow viscus perforation. Methods This prospective observational study included 106 patients aged 18 years and above who underwent surgery for hollow viscus perforation at a tertiary care center in Tripura, India, between August 2022 and January 2024. The SAS was calculated intraoperatively based on estimated blood loss, lowest mean arterial pressure, and lowest heart rate. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification. The correlation between SAS and complication severity was analyzed. Results The mean age of the participants was 41.3 ± 15.2 years, with male predominance (87%, 92/106). Gastric perforation was most common (67.9%, 72/106). The most frequently observed SAS was 6, accounting for 39.6% (42/106) of the cases. A strong negative correlation was found between the SAS and Clavien-Dindo grade (Spearman's ρ = -0.664, p < 0.001), indicating that lower SASs were associated with higher grades of complications. Conclusion The SAS demonstrated a significant inverse correlation with postoperative complication severity in patients who had undergone surgery for hollow viscus perforation. The SAS may serve as a simple yet effective tool for predicting outcomes and informing postoperative management in this setting."

We report the case of a previously healthy 48-year-old woman who presented with acute anal pain and constipation. Despite initial conservative management, her symptoms rapidly worsened. Cross-sectional imaging revealed a large fecaloma in the sigmoid colon with signs of colonic ischemia and perforation. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a substantial anterior rectal wall perforation, and a Hartmann's procedure was performed. Histopathological examination demonstrated transmural necrosis and ulceration consistent with stercoral disease. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, with resolution of sepsis and stabilization of hematologic abnormalities. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and imaging in patients with severe constipation and abdominal symptoms. Stercoral perforation, though rare, must be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, and timely surgical intervention remains essential to prevent catastrophic outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 45-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with acute right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain. Her past medical history was significant for heavy menstrual bleeding and moderate dysmenorrhea, though a diagnosis of endometriosis had never been established previously. Initial work-up revealed anemia and leucocytosis. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed an enlarged structure in RLQ along the medial border of the cecum, suspicious for acute appendicitis with a retained rupture. CA19-9, CA-125, and CEA were sent, of which only CA-125 was elevated at 92.7 U/mL (reference range: 0-35 U/mL). She was admitted to the hospital for complicated appendicitis and was started on IV piperacillin-tazobactam. A repeat CT scan to monitor response to antibiotics showed acute appendicitis along with phlegmon with a small amount of free fluid, and an enlarged heterogeneous uterus with thickened endometrium, uterine fibroids, and a left ovarian cyst. A CT-guided drainage by Interventional Radiology (IR) was deferred due to concerns for a suspected malignant appendiceal mass, and she was treated with 14 days of antibiotics in the setting of complicated appendicitis. An appendiceal biopsy via colonoscopy after discharge revealed a serrated adenoma. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy and a right hemicolectomy due to concern for appendiceal malignancy. The final histopathology showed a 2.8 cm endometriotic mass involving the wall of the appendix and surrounding tissue, one diverticulum of the colon, and was negative for dysplasia and malignancy. She had a further gynecologic workup with an in-office hysteroscopy, endometrial biopsy, and a pelvic MRI. The pathology showed no evidence of atypical hyperplasia or malignancy. The MRI revealed numerous uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis, and a left adnexal endometrioma measuring 3.6 x 3.2 cm. She underwent a subsequent robotic-assisted total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, left oophorectomy, right ovarian cystectomy, and extensive adhesiolysis/enterolysis with intraoperative colorectal surgery consultation. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. This report highlights the importance of considering extragonadal endometriosis in women of reproductive age as a differential diagnosis for RLQ pain and mass. It also underscores the importance of investigating the preoperative findings of appendiceal masses in women of childbearing age with appendiceal endometriosis presenting as an acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "The advent of bariatric surgery as a widespread intervention is paralleled by comprehensive data capture in bariatric registries following elective surgery. However, significant challenges hinder tracking the incidence and nature of severe complications in the context of bariatric surgery. As the prevalence of bariatric procedures escalates, the establishment of a dedicated, prospective complication registry becomes imperative. Such an initiative would facilitate a nuanced understanding of bariatric surgical emergency (BSE) within the current healthcare milieu, enhance economic evaluations, elucidate long-term patient outcomes, and inform requisite adjustments in professional training. This study is designed to capture and assess the ramifications of emergency bariatric surgical practices within the United Kingdom. We propose a prospective, multi-center, audit of emergency bariatric surgical activity in all UK hospitals. Eligible participants are those who undergo any intervention or procedure (surgical or endoscopic) to diagnose or treat BSE. Primary outcome measures will include hospital length of stay, rates of complications (Clavien-Dindo), and 30-D mortality. Secondary outcomes will assess the broader impacts and patterns of care, including variations in practice and resource utilization across the nation, rates of outpatient follow-up, and the frequency of subsequent procedures (surgical or endoscopic) post-BSE. Additionally, the study will investigate potential predictors for patients' choice between state-funded and self-pay bariatric surgery options, considering factors such as ethnicity and previous engagement with NHS-specialized weight loss pathways. This study will be registered as clinical audit at each participating hospital. The protocol will be disseminated through the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society network and using a targeted social media-based strategy in the UK."

    "abstract": "Gastric and duodenal ulcer perforation represents one of the most critical causes of acute abdomen, necessitating urgent surgical intervention. While primary repair with omental patch remains the standard treatment for uncomplicated cases, alternative surgical approaches may be preferable in complex or delayed presentations. We illustrate this variability through two distinct cases. Case I: A recurrent gastric perforation managed via wedge resection using linear staplers, reinforced with Lembert sutures to ensure staple-line integrity. Case II: A delayed duodenal perforation treated with Heineke-Mikulicz duodenoplasty combined with omentoplasty to address tissue edema and mitigate leakage risk. These cases highlight the necessity of adapting surgical strategies to patient-specific factors, such as perforation chronicity, tissue viability, and prior intervention history. Unlike routine repairs, complex scenarios often demand advanced techniques to optimize outcomes and reduce morbidity."

This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the distinctive multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) findings of intraperitoneal and retro-/extraperitoneal perforation by comparing the locations of free air in the abdomen and other imaging findings. A total of 226 patients with acute abdominal pain who visited the emergency department and underwent contrast-enhanced CT between January 2016 and November 2023 were included. The study consisted of 146 male and 80 female patients with a median age of 53.5 years. Surgical findings determined the site of perforation in all cases. Two radiologists evaluated the CT images in a consensus blind to operative findings, assessing the presence of specific air distributions and strong predictors of gastrointestinal tract perforation. The study included 192 intraperitoneal and 34 retro-/extraperitoneal perforation cases. Subphrenic free air and periportal free air were statistically significant in differentiating intraperitoneal gastrointestinal tract perforation among specific air distributions. Conversely, the presence of free air in the minor pelvis, right lower quadrant, left lower quadrant, and retroperitoneum was significant in differentiating retro-/extraperitoneal gastrointestinal tract perforation. Among strong imaging predictors, only ascites was statistically significant in differentiating intraperitoneal from retro-/extraperitoneal perforations. Findings from MDCT may serve as predictive indicators for the precise localization of gastrointestinal tract perforations, which is crucial for appropriate management and surgical planning.

ZIEL: Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es, retrospektiv die verschiedenen Befunde in der Mehrschicht-Computertomographie (MDCT) bei intraperitonealen und retro-/extraperitonealen Perforationen durch Vergleich der Lokalisation von freier Luft im Abdomen und anderen Befunden zu untersuchen. In die Studie wurden 226 Patienten mit akuten Bauchschmerzen einbezogen, welche sich zwischen Januar 2016 und November 2023 in der Notaufnahme vorstellten und bei denen eine kontrastmittelverstärkte Computertomographie (CT) durchgeführt wurde. Studienteilnehmer waren 146 männliche und 80 weibliche Patienten mit einem mittleren Alter von 53,5 Jahren. In sämtlichen Fällen wurde die Stelle der Perforation anhand der chirurgischen Befunde festgestellt. Zwei Radiologen beurteilten die CT-Aufnahmen in einem Konsensverfahren ohne Kenntnis der operativen Befunde, sie untersuchten dabei das Vorliegen spezifischer Luftverteilungen und starker Prädiktoren einer Perforation im Gastrointestinaltrakt. Die Studie umfasste 192 Fälle mit intraperitonealer und 34 Fälle mit retro-/extraperitonealer Perforation. Subphrenische freie Luft und periportale freie Luft waren von statistisch signifikanter Bedeutung für die Erkennung intraperitonealer Perforationen im Gastrointestinaltrakt anhand spezifischer Luftverteilungen. Dagegen war das Vorliegen freier Luft im kleinen Becken, rechten unteren Quadranten, linken unteren Quadranten und Retroperitoneum von signifikanter Bedeutung für die Erkennung retro-/extraperitonealer Perforationen im Gastrointestinaltrakt. Unter den starken Prädiktoren in der Bildgebung war nur Aszites von statistisch signifikanter Bedeutung bei der Unterscheidung intraperitonealer von retro-/extraperitonealen Perforationen. MDCT-Befunde können als prädiktive Indikatoren für die genaue Lokalisierung von Perforationen im Gastrointestinaltrakt dienen, was entscheidend ist für eine angemessene Versorgung und chirurgische Planung."

    "title": "A Rare Condition: Nonhemorrhagic Infarct of Adrenal Gland in Pregnancy.",
    "abstract": "Adrenal infarction can be hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic, while the latter is much less common. Non-hemorrhagic adrenal infarction (NHAI) is a rare but potentially serious cause of acute abdominal pain in pregnancy that can lead to significant adverse outcomes for both mother and baby if not treated promptly and appropriately. Diagnosis of this condition is challenging due to the non-specific nature of clinical and laboratory findings. Ultrasound (US) has limited utility in diagnosing retroperitoneal pathology, while the use of computed tomography (CT) is restricted due to concerns about fetal radiation exposure. Diagnosis is typically based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, with other potential etiological causes of abdominal pain being systematically ruled out. Treatment primarily consists of analgesics and anticoagulants. In this case report, we present a pregnant patient who arrived at the emergency department with an acute abdomen. Various MR images are provided, illustrating the diagnostic process. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulants and antibiotherapy. Through this case, we aim to highlight the role of imaging in the differential diagnosis, management, and follow-up of pregnant patients presenting with acute abdominal conditions."

    "abstract": "Alvarado and acute inflammatory response (AIR) scoring systems are the most common clinical diagnostic scoring systems for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. We investigated how successful these scorings are in terms of excluding urgent gynecological pathologies. Patients who underwent emergency surgery by the general surgery team due to acute abdomen clinic in our hospital between 2018 and 2023 and were detected to have gynecological pathology during the operation were included in the study. General medical characteristics of the patients, preoperative laboratory values, findings in preoperative imaging, Alvarado and AIR scores, final diagnoses, and surgical procedures performed were recorded. A total of 78 patients were included in the study, 39 patients forming the case group and 39 patients forming the control group. No significant difference was found between the control and case groups in terms of the age of the patients, presence of additional diseases, and WBC value (p: 0.877, p: 0.092, p: 0.500). While the rate of normal findings on ultrasonography (USG) in the case group was significantly lower than in the control group (p: 0.001), the rate of normal findings on computed tomography (CT) was significantly higher than in the control group (p: 0.000). CRP value and length of stay in the case group were significantly higher than in the control group (p: 0.050, p: 0.000). There was no statistically significant relationship between Alvarado or AIR score of 9 or above and whether urgent gynecological pathology was detected (p: 0.073, p: 0.723). It was observed that Alvarado and AIR scores failed to exclude urgent gynecological pathologies."

    "abstract": "To determine the morbidity e.g., anastomotic leakage and wound infections, in children enduring early (same-admission) vs. late (routine-interval) stoma reversal. A quasi-experimental study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Paediatric Surgery Unit II, The Children's Hospital and University of Child Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, from February 2022 to March 2023. This study enrolled 60 patients with an emergency temporary stoma, using a non-probability consecutive sampling technique. Among them, half of the patients (n = 30) underwent early stoma reversal (Group A), while the remaining half underwent the procedure after a routine interval of 2 months or more (Group B). The frequencies of anastomotic leakage and surgical site infection were compared using the Chi-square test. In this study, 60 temporary ileostomy stomas were reversed. The group that underwent same-admission reversal compromised comparatively younger patients (median: 12 vs. 66 months). Both groups had mostly male patients. Operative time was also comparable in both groups. No cases of anastomotic leakage were observed in either group. The overall wound infection rate was similar in both groups; however, more patients in the routine-interval stoma reversal group experienced minor wound infections, Southampton Grade I and II. Stoma reversal during the same admission has shown a comparable rate of anastomotic leakage, surgical site infection, and operative time. Patients with an emergency temporary stoma can undergo stoma reversal in the early postoperative period without any major risk of complications. Early stoma reversal, Routine interval stoma reversal, Surgical site infection, Anastomotic leak."

Despite its low incidence, NF poses significant challenges due to its aggressive nature and high mortality rates. This retrospective study aimed to assess clinical characteristics and prognostic factors influencing mortality rates among patients diagnosed with NF at a tertiary care facility. Patients diagnosed with NF at the emergency department of tertiary care hospital in Turkiye between August 1, 2017, and July 31, 2023, were included in the study. Demographic data, clinical features, underlying factors, laboratory findings, and outcomes were reviewed. A total of 69 adult patients were included in the study. Among cases, 51 survived (73.5%) and 18 died (26.5%). There were 43 males (62.3%) and 26 females (37.7%) with a mean age of 55.8±16.1 years. The most common symptoms were pain/tenderness (84.1%), erythema (75.4%), local swelling (72.5%), and crepitus (44.9%). Diabetes mellitus, lower systolic blood pressure, higher pulse rates, elevated white blood cell counts, and polymicrobial infections were associated with poor outcomes (p<0.001, p=0.020, p<0.001, p=0.016, and p<0.001, respectively). NF is a rare surgical emergency. Early diagnosis, prompt intervention, and multidisciplinary management are crucial in mitigating NF's devastating consequences.

    "abstract": "Uterine fibroids (leiomyoma) are a common presentation in women of reproductive age. However, during pregnancy, red degeneration and torsion of a subserosal fibroid may present with an acute abdomen, creating a diagnostic dilemma. Red degeneration of a fibroid during pregnancy responds to conservative management, whereas torsion of a subserosal fibroid requires emergency myomectomy. The authors present the case of a woman in her early 30s at 21 weeks gestation presenting with acute onset of right-sided abdominal pain. Ultrasound examination confirmed the diagnosis of fibroid degeneration. She was managed conservatively with analgesia and was discharged home uneventfully after 72 hours. This case report illustrates the diagnostic difficulties often encountered in managing abdominal pain during pregnancy complicated by a fibroid uterus."

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of necrotising vasculitis characterised by eosinophilic infiltration and systemic involvement, most commonly affecting the lungs, skin, and peripheral nerves. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are common in patients with EGPA, although histopathological confirmation of GI involvement is infrequent. Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but its presentation as an initial manifestation of EGPA is exceptionally uncommon. We report the case of a 54-year-old man with a history of asthma who presented with fever and epigastric pain that later migrated to the right lower quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated mild appendiceal enlargement, and a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. Postoperatively, he developed persistent lower abdominal pain, new-onset bilateral lower extremity pain, and marked eosinophilia (60%). Histopathological examination of the resected appendix revealed dense eosinophilic infiltration and necrotising vasculitis, establishing the diagnosis of ANCA-negative EGPA. This phenotype is known to present with gastrointestinal manifestations and peripheral eosinophilia frequently. He was subsequently transferred to a specialised centre for further treatment. This case highlights the potential for EGPA to mimic acute appendicitis. When persistent eosinophilia and atypical postoperative symptoms are present, systemic diseases such as EGPA should be considered. Histopathological analysis plays a pivotal role in identifying underlying systemic vasculitis, particularly in cases with unusual clinical presentations. Greater awareness of EGPA as a differential diagnosis in atypical appendicitis may facilitate earlier recognition and timely management."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most frequent non-traumatic surgical emergency in children. While laparoscopic surgery is standard, postoperative recovery often involves pain, delayed bowel function, and reduced mobility. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) may improve recovery by addressing fascial restrictions and visceral dysfunction. This pilot study investigates OMT's effect on postoperative pain and hospital length of stay in pediatric patients undergoing appendectomy. This non-randomized, time-controlled clinical trial was conducted at Meyer Pediatric Hospital (Florence, Italy) with 43 patients aged 5-17 undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy. Participants were divided by appendicitis type (complicated/uncomplicated) and treatment group (OMT vs. control). The OMT group received two standardized sessions within 48 h post-surgery. Primary outcomes included postoperative pain (assessed via Numeric Rating Scale) and hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included bowel function, mobilization, and nausea/vomiting. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistics and t-tests, with p < 0.05 as the significance threshold. The OMT group showed a shorter mean hospital stay (4.6 vs. 7 days) and significantly greater reductions in abdominal and shoulder pain compared to controls. In uncomplicated appendicitis, pain reduction reached 3/10 vs. 1.7/10 in controls; in complicated cases, 3.6/10 vs. 1.8/10. Shoulder pain relief was also more pronounced in the OMT groups. Improvements in bowel function, mobilization, and nausea were observed in both groups, with no statistically significant differences. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that OMT may enhance postoperative recovery in pediatric appendectomy by reducing pain and potentially shortening hospital stays. Although not statistically significant due to the small sample size, the clinical relevance of these findings supports further investigation through larger, randomized trials."

    "abstract": "The One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB) is increasingly prevalent as a primary and revision bariatric surgical procedure as it demonstrates a remarkable weight loss outcome. One of the benefits of OAGB is the low incidence of internal hernias (IHs); IHs after OAGB have rarely been documented. We describe the laparoscopic repair of an IH in a 54-year-old female with a one-year history of OAGB performed as a revision surgery after sleeve gastrectomy for weight regain. She presented to the emergency room with a sudden onset abdominal pain and constipation mimicking IH, which was diagnosed laparoscopically after a non-conclusive findings on double contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Clinical presentation of IH after OAGB ranges from asymptomatic to being manifested as an acute abdomen. The difficulty in managing IHs lies in its accurate diagnosis. Physical examinations and laboratory tests are typically unreliable. The CT findings may be unremarkable in patients with intermittent symptoms. In the literature, diagnostic laparoscopy is considered the cornerstone of the diagnosis and management of highly apprehensive cases of IH with non-conclusive CT findings. A late diagnosis may lead to a dramatic increase in morbidity and mortality rates. Thus, in this case, we considered early intervention for the diagnosis and repair of IH. IH should be suspected in patients with vague abdominal pain after OAGB and normal CT findings, warranting early intervention. Moreover, we demonstrated that OAGB does not eliminate the risk of IH development."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis is a life-threatening surgical emergency with high mortality. Early identification of patients at increased risk of poor outcomes is critical for optimizing care. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of combining serial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores and serial serum lactate levels in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis. In this prospective cohort study, 120 adult patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis and undergoing emergency laparotomy were enrolled after obtaining ethical approval and informed consent. APACHE II scores and serum lactate levels were recorded at three time points: preoperatively (baseline), 6 h postoperatively, and 24 h postoperatively. The primary objective of this study was a combination of serial APACHE II and serial serum lactate level (baseline, 6 h and 24 h post-operatively) and its correlation with post-operative mortality in emergency laparotomy for hollow viscus perforation peritonitis. Data were analysed to compare clinical variables between survivors and non-survivors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) analyses were used to assess the predictive performance of individual and combined markers. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 35%. Significant differences in age, serial APACHE II scores, and serial serum lactate levels were observed between survivors and non-survivors. A serum lactate level of ≥ 1.88 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 69.2% (AUC: 0.817; p = 0.0001). APACHE II scores of ≥ 11.16 yielded a sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 91% (AUC: 0.915; p = 0.0001). Both serial lactate levels and APACHE II scores were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. The combination of serial APACHE II scores and serum lactate (cutoff ≥ 11.95) had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 82%, and an AUC of 0.919 (p = 0.0001), making it the preferred predictor for 30-day post-operative mortality. The combination of serial APACHE II scores and serial serum lactate levels provides superior prognostic accuracy for predicting 30-day postoperative mortality in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for gastrointestinal perforation peritonitis. This approach may facilitate early identification of high-risk patients and guide clinical decision-making. Not applicable."

Research about non-traumatic abdominal pain is limited in Rwanda and East Africa. This study aims to understand the clinical profile and outcomes of non-traumatic abdominal pain at the largest tertiary hospital in Rwanda. A prospective cohort study of patients presenting with non-traumatic abdominal pain was undertaken. During the 5-month study, two hundred sixty-one patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 39.7 years and male patients accounted for 57.5 % of the cohort. Nearly half of the cohort were triaged as a high priority (11.1 % red, 31.8 % orange), and 42.9 % were hemodynamically unstable at or shortly after presentation. More than half of the patients (57 %) had surgical conditions, including 40.2 % who underwent surgery and 17.6 % who were treated conservatively. The most common diagnoses were intestinal obstruction (25.7 % of all cases) and hollow viscus perforation (18.8 %). Mortality was 11.1 %, and the mean hospital length of stay was 9.1 days. Predicting factors for death outcome (p-value<0.05) were advanced age, altered mental status, jaundice at presentation, peritonitis, known malignancy, and acute kidney injury. Abdominal pain is a common presenting problem, accounting for approximately 1 in 10 patients presenting to a tertiary care centre in Rwanda, with 2 in 5 patients requiring operative interventions. Identification of potential risk factors for mortality requires a multidisciplinary approach to decrease mortality and morbidity."

We report the case of a male neonate born at 33 weeks of gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 1,780 grams. The initial postnatal adaptation was satisfactory. However, on the second day of life, the infant developed sudden and severe abdominal distension associated with bilious vomiting and signs of respiratory distress. A plain abdominal radiograph revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum, highly suggestive of gastrointestinal perforation. The neonate underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a 2 cm linear perforation on the anterior wall of the stomach. The perforation was repaired primarily without the need for gastric resection. Despite early surgical intervention and aggressive postoperative management in a neonatal intensive care unit, the infant's condition deteriorated rapidly. He developed signs of sepsis, refractory shock, and multiorgan failure, and succumbed within 48 hours postoperatively. This case underscores the fulminant course and high mortality rate associated with SGP, especially in preterm neonates. It highlights the critical importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion in the presence of acute abdominal symptoms and radiologic findings, as early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are essential for improving outcomes in these vulnerable patients."

    "abstract": "Intestinal malrotation is an inherited condition where the midgut is not properly rotated, and it tends to be noticed in infancy. It becomes evident in later life with unusual abdominal pain and vomiting, which happen due to occasional blockages. Consequently, there is a risk of midgut volvulus and damage to the blood supply of the bowel. For diagnosis, the best method is imaging, especially using a contrast-enhanced upper gastrointestinal series that reveals characteristic signs such as a corkscrew shape and a misplaced duodenojejunal junction. Using ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scans, visualization of an unusual relationship between the superior mesenteric vessel and whirlpool sign, as well as abnormal location of the jejunal artery, can be confirmed. Most surgeons use the elective Ladd's procedure for the surgery. When bowel ischemia is found, surgery must be done, and this may result in the difficulties of short bowel syndrome. Given the variable and often subtle clinical presentation, a high index of suspicion for intestinal malrotation is crucial among patients presenting with acute abdomen and intestinal ischemia, necessitating prompt surgical intervention guided by accurate clinical and radiological evaluation to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children with approximately 30 % of patients presenting with perforation, defined as a hole in the appendix or a fecalith found in the abdomen, at time of surgery. Our previous protocol at time of discharge, with an 8 % intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) rate, included checking a white blood cell count (WBC) on day of discharge, with a value ≥ 10 serving as a trigger for additional outpatient oral antibiotics course. Beginning in May, 2023 we changed our protocol to no longer obtain WBC count or prescribe outpatient antibiotics at time of discharge. The purpose of this study is to determine if the post-discharge IAA rate of patients with perforated appendicitis was impacted with no antibiotics at discharge. A prospective observational study of patients <18 years old who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis between May 1, 2023-May 1, 2024 at a single institution was completed. Patients were treated with antibiotics while inpatient and then discharged without antibiotics once appropriate discharge criteria were met (pain controlled, afebrile ≥12 h, and tolerating regular diet). A total of 202 patients were managed for perforated appendicitis since the protocol change. The median LOS for the entire cohort was 3.02 days (IQR 2.11, 4.21). 9.9 % of patients (N = 20) developed IAA after discharge, 15 (7 %) of which were readmitted. Median LOS for these patients was 2.81 days (2.49, 3.32) compared to median LOS of 3.03 days (2.12, 4.22) (p = 0.65). Eight patients (4 %) underwent percutaneous drainage with interventional radiology (IR). Patients who developed IAA after discharge had longer operative times (52 min vs 40 min, p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in age, BMI, LOS, antibiotic duration, or presenting symptoms for patients that developed IAA compared to those that did not develop IAA. Under the context of a one-tailed non-inferiority study with a non-inferiority margin of 12 % and our given sample size for the two groups (power = 0.801, alpha = 0.025), the difference in post-operative IAA rates between the two groups is 2 % (95 % CI: -2 %-7 %), concluding that withholding antibiotics at discharge is non-inferior. Omission of outpatient antibiotics and pre-discharge laboratory testing did not result in a significant change in post-operative IAA rate after discharge. IV, Prospective observational study."

While endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become the preferred approach, significant regional disparities remain in diagnosis, treatment accessibility, and outcomes. This study aimed to analyze rAAA repair trends in South Korea over a decade, highlighting inequities and proposing a centralized referral model. This retrospective cohort study analyzed patients who underwent rAAA repair between 2007 and 2016 using the national Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database. Patients were identified using ICD-10 and procedural codes for EVAR and open surgical repair (OSR). Regional differences in diagnosis, repair rates, 30-day mortality, and referral patterns were analyzed to propose an optimized hospital network. Of 13,832 AAA repairs, 1,812 (13.1%) were for rAAA. EVAR increased from 30.8% in 2007 to 73.7% in 2016, surpassing OSR since 2012. rAAA repairs were concentrated in metropolitan areas (86.6%), showing significant patient influx to Seoul and Daegu (+16.9% and +13.1%, respectively), while low-volume regions exhibited patient efflux rates exceeding 20%. The 30-day mortality rate for rAAA repair was 13.5% nationally, showing evident regional disparities. Low-volume regions demonstrated less than two rAAA repairs per million people, suggesting a potential selective treatment bias. A 50-km referral system designating 28 vascular centers capable at least 4.5 rAAA repairs annually is proposed, considering transport networks and hospital distribution. National guidelines should implement a coordinated transfer system to ensure timely, equitable access to specialized care and improve survival outcomes."

Early diagnosis is crucial for improving outcomes, as shown in the case of a 53-year-old male with a 24-hour history of constipation, bloating, colicky pain, and bilious vomiting. He exhibited signs of severe illness, including tachycardia, fever, and abdominal distention, with blood tests showing acute inflammation. After stabilization, an emergency laparotomy revealed a necrotic, 360°-twisted cecum and abnormal intestinal positioning. The patient underwent a right colectomy with appendectomy and ileostomy, recovering uneventfully and later having the stoma reversed. Though nonrotation is usually asymptomatic in adults, it can lead to life-threatening complications like volvulus, requiring surgical intervention. This case highlights the importance of recognizing embryologic abnormalities in adults with acute abdominal symptoms to prevent severe outcomes and underscores the need for prompt surgical treatment in cecal volvulus."

    "abstract": "Small intestinal ulcers are occasionally observed in daily medical practice, and although diagnostic abilities have improved in recent years and the disease pathogenesis has been elucidated, recurrence remains common, requiring proper therapeutic intervention. Herein, we report two cases of small intestine ulceration in young patients who did not experience recurrence for a long period of time after appropriate treatment at disease onset. Case 1 was of a 34-year-old woman who had been taking diclofenac sodium. She was diagnosed with intestinal obstruction through abdominal computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent partial resection of the obstructed ileum. Histopathological examination revealed fibrosis in the submucosa, leading to a diagnosis of stenosis secondary to drug-induced small intestinal ulceration caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Postoperatively, the NSAIDs were changed to a selective COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib). Case 2 was of a 33-year-old man who underwent emergency surgery after an abdominal CT revealed free air. A perforation was found in the small intestine, and the area was resected. Histopathological examination revealed only nonspecific inflammatory findings, leading to a diagnosis of perforation due to a simple small intestinal ulcer. No recurrence was observed in 10 years in both cases. Thus, appropriate management of simple, nonmalignant small intestinal ulcers at initial presentation could be the only treatment needed, with long postoperative recurrence-free periods. These cases demonstrated that proper management of simple, nonmalignant small intestinal ulcers at the initial presentation can be the only treatment needed for long postoperative recurrence-free periods. With an aging society and improved diagnostic capabilities, small intestinal ulcers may become more common in the future. Therefore, the possibility of small intestinal ulceration should be considered when diagnosing ulcerative lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as acute abdomen."

This retrospective study evaluated pediatric patients with abdominal symptoms who underwent ultrasonography before computed tomography (CT), the gold standard for diagnosing intra-abdominal air. The diagnostic performance of ultrasonography was determined based on this standard. In pediatric patients with intra-abdominal free air, free air sizes (massive or focal), and age were compared between those in whom free air was and was not detected on ultrasonography using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. A total of 240 patients were evaluated. Among the 14 patients with intra-abdominal free air, 10 patients were correctly diagnosed using ultrasonography. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ultrasonography for detecting intra-abdominal free air were 98.3% (236/240), 71.4% (10/14), 100% (226/226), 100% (10/10), and 98.3% (226/230), respectively. Although the differences were not statistically significant, diagnosis tended to be more difficult in patients with focal free air and older age (massive versus focal free air and ages in patients with ultrasonographically detected versus undetected free air = 6/4 versus 0/4, P = .084; age: 5.2 ± 6.4 years [0-16.7 years] versus 11.6 ± 5.2 years [5.7-16.8 years], P = .089). Ultrasonography has satisfactory diagnostic accuracy for detecting intra-abdominal free air in pediatric patients with acute abdomen, but not all cases are detected. Examiners and physicians should consider further examinations and management for these patients."

    "title": "When Gynecological Anatomy Becomes a Surgical Emergency: A Rare Internal Hernia Case.",
    "abstract": "Internal hernias represent an uncommon etiology of small bowel obstruction (SBO). Among these, herniation through a defect in the broad ligament is one of the least common types. Because symptoms are vague and imaging findings are often minimal, these presentations can be easily overlooked and may progress to bowel ischemia or gangrene. A 47-year-old multiparous woman with no history of abdominal surgery presented to the emergency department with severe, worsening abdominal pain that developed over the past 12 hours. Ultrasound was the only imaging modality available. It detected free fluid in the abdomen but did not identify a specific organ abnormality. The clinical team initially proceeded with an open appendicectomy, which was subsequently converted to an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, they identified an internal hernia that had passed through a defect in the left broad ligament. Approximately 25 cm of the necrotic bowel was resected, and the remaining segments were joined with a primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient recovered without incident and was discharged home once her bowel function resumed. While broad ligament hernias are exceedingly rare, they should be kept in mind as a possible explanation for obstruction in females who have not undergone pelvic surgery. Preoperative diagnosis is frequently missed because of subtle imaging clues and the infrequency of the disease in everyday practice. When advanced radiology is limited or inconclusive, surgical exploration remains the most reliable route to both identify the problem and provide timely treatment. Although rare, broad ligament hernias should be considered in female patients presenting with SBO and no prior abdominal operations. Prompt recognition and surgical intervention are vital to minimize morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, with a lifetime risk of 8.6% in men and 6.7% in women. The standard of care is appendectomy, which can be performed using a single-incision laparoscopic approach. The evidence on single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA) is predominantly based on randomized controlled trials, often excluding patients with comorbidities or complex clinical profiles. This study aimed to generate real-world data (RWD) on adult patients undergoing SILA to assess its safety, feasibility, and clinical outcomes in routine practice. In addition, the study aimed to identify patient-specific risk factors for intraoperative and postoperative complications. Data were obtained from the prospective multicenter SILAP registry, which included adult patients (≥18 years) who underwent SILA between January 2012 and April 2016. Demographic and clinical data including perioperative outcomes, were collected. Inclusion criteria comprised the ability and willingness to provide informed consent, while exclusion criteria included participation in other interventional studies. A descriptive comparison with high-volume studies was performed, focusing on key perioperative outcomes, including complication rates, operative time, length of hospital stay, mortality, and conversion rate. A total of 276 patients from 14 different hospitals in Germany who underwent SILA were included. The mean operative time was 50.9 minutes (standard deviation [SD] ± 27.6). The average postoperative length of stay was 3.6 days (SD ± 4.3), and the mortality rate was 0%. Intraoperative complications occurred in 1.8%, while 6.2% had postoperative complications. No significant associations were found between sex, age, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification and perioperative complications. In 96.4% of cases, the appendectomy was successfully completed using the single-incision technique. SILA demonstrates safety and feasibility for managing acute appendicitis in routine clinical practice. The RWD supports outcomes of clinical trials. Further validation is required to confirm risk factors for complication of specific subgroups."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen often requires urgent surgical intervention. In certain instances, thyrotoxicosis can contribute to the onset of acute abdomen. This relationship complicates both diagnosis and management. Therefore, understanding the interplay between thyrotoxicosis and acute abdomen is essential for implementing effective treatment strategies. This case report aims to illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges encountered in managing a patient with mesenteric ischemia due to thyroid storm, emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in achieving favorable outcomes. We describe a case of a 54-year-old female who presented with acute abdominal pain, rapidly deteriorating to respiratory failure requiring intubation. Initial investigations revealed an embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery and signs of bowel ischemia as well as cardiopulmonary decompensation. To evaluate the cause of the cardiac failure, subsequent thyroid function tests confirmed hyperthyroidism. The patient underwent endovascular embolectomy, bowel resection, and later a total thyroidectomy. The patient's acute abdomen was managed with embolectomy and bowel resection. A Burch-Wartofsky score of 75 was highly suggestive of thyroid storm, leading to an urgent total thyroidectomy after interdisciplinary discussion. Histopathological examination confirmed chronic thyroid inflammation with increased endocrine activity. This case highlights the serious complication of mesenteric ischemia due to thyroid storm. Endovascular thrombectomy and bowel resection effectively managed the ischemia, while thyroidectomy facilitated a rapid return to a euthyroid state. This case serves as a valuable reference for the management of similar presentations, demonstrating the potential for successful outcomes with timely, aggressive treatment."

    "abstract": "Background Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a frequent surgical emergency associated with significant variability in clinical outcomes and hospital length of stay (LOS). Early identification of patients at risk for prolonged hospitalization can improve triage and resource planning. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), and total bilirubin (TBil), along with biliary complications like choledocholithiasis and Mirizzi syndrome, may have prognostic value. Materials and methods This retrospective study included 150 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for AC at the Department of General and Abdominal Surgery, University Clinical Centre Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, between January 1, 2024, and January 31, 2025. Demographic, laboratory, and intraoperative data were collected. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified optimal cut-offs for inflammatory markers predicting prolonged LOS (≥7 days). Multivariate linear regression was used to assess independent predictors, including CRP, WBC, TBil, and intraoperative findings. Results We found that CRP was significantly higher in patients with prolonged LOS and demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.733 (95% CI: 0.630-0.835), followed by TBil and WBC. In multivariate analysis, only CRP ≥110.5 mg/L (p<0.001), the presence of choledocholithiasis in 26 patients (17.3%; p=0.010), and Mirizzi syndrome in seven patients (4.7%; p=0.017) remained significant predictors. WBC and TBil lost significance after adjustment. Conclusion CRP is the most reliable independent laboratory predictor of prolonged LOS in AC. The presence of choledocholithiasis and Mirizzi syndrome further contributes to extended hospitalization. These factors should be considered in early clinical risk assessment."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is life-threatening abdominal surgical emergency worldwide, requires timely medical intervention to prevent adverse outcomes such as wound infection, pneumonia, intra-peritoneal fluid collection, and death. These complications remain a significant challenge in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the pooled magnitude of unfavorable management outcome and identify associated factors among appendicitis patients in Ethiopia. We conducted a systematic search of databases for studies reporting appendicitis outcomes in Ethiopia. Eligible studies were screened based on predefined criteria. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 14. Heterogeneity was assessed with I² and Cochran's Q tests; due to substantial heterogeneity, a random-effects model was applied. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger's test, and the trim-and-fill method. Subgroup analyses explored sources of heterogeneity based on study region and hospital type. Eighteen studies articles were included. The pooled prevalence of unfavorable management outcome among appendicitis patient was 12.71% (95%CI: 9.32-16.09). Sub-group analysis showed that Oromia region had the highest prevalence of poor management outcome. Duration of illness [AOR = 4.41 (95%CI: 1.42-13.70)], right lower quadrant abdominal mass [AOR = 4.1 (95%CI: 2.29-7.34)], presence of intraoperative abscess [AOR = 6.9 (95% CI: 3.61-13.22)], lengths of postoperative hospital stays [OR = 5.28 (95%CI: 2.31-12.04)], elevated white blood cell count [AOR = 4.09 (95%CI: 2.22-7.54)] were a significant association with unfavorable management outcome of appendicitis. Unfavorable management outcomes in appendicitis patients in Ethiopia are significantly associated with several clinical factors. Enhancing early diagnosis, prompt surgical intervention, and standardized postoperative care are essential to reduce these adverse outcomes."

We present a case of a 48-year-old female with a history of recurrent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy (done two years back), who presented with an acute onset of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Initial evaluation revealed signs of intestinal obstruction and metabolic acidosis. Imaging confirmed sigmoid colo-colic intussusception with a suspected mass lesion as the lead point, later identified intraoperatively as a retained surgical mop. Despite emergent surgical intervention with bowel resection and stoma formation, the patient's clinical course was complicated by septic shock, acute kidney injury, and refractory metabolic acidosis, leading to a fatal outcome.

Although robotic surgery has demonstrated advantages in elective procedures, its safety, feasibility, and applicability across a broad spectrum of acute care conditions remain undefined. We conducted a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from inception to December 2024 for studies analyzing the safety profile of robotic approaches in adult care surgery. Primary outcomes included length of stay, postoperative complications, conversion to open surgery, operative time, 30-day readmission, and mortality. Our search yielded 3,740 results. After proper analysis, a total of eighteen studies were included (2016-2024; n = 4,439,317), in which robotic approaches showed shorter length of stay (0.7-28.46 vs. 1-38.26 days), lower complication rates (2-25.62% vs. 3.7-46%), and fewer conversions (0-11.5% vs. 0-28.7%) compared to laparoscopy, though operative times were longer (67-323 vs. 46-294.5 min). Procedure-specific trends emerged, particularly to robotic cholecystectomy, concerning fewer complications (0.5-25.62% vs. 8.23-21%) and conversions (0-1.9% vs. 1.9-8.57%). In this review, robotic surgery appears as a safe and feasible alternative in acute care settings, offering potential advantages in hospital stay, postoperative complications, and conversion rates-especially for cholecystectomy and colectomy-despite longer operative durations. Further randomized trials and cost-effectiveness analyses are warranted to define its optimal role. Level III, Systematic Review Study.

We performed a retrospective study examining short-term outcomes of TEVAR oversizing for BTAI patients at our institution from 2004 to 2024. The primary outcome was procedural success, while secondary outcomes included endoleak, graft occlusion, and reintervention. A total of thirty-three cases involving BTAI were managed by TEVAR, with a mean age of 48.9±19.4 years. The injury severity score averaged 29.1±9.6 points. Most cases were grade 3 BTAI, accounting for 87.9%. The mean aortic diameter at the proximal landing zone was 24.4±3.6 mm, and the distal zone was 22.5±4.0 mm. Proximal stent oversizing was 31.9±4.1%, and the distal was 28.5±4.1%. All cases achieved procedural success.

Delays in care may necessitate orchiectomy, which has been associated with reduced fertility. It can occur at any age, with two peaks of frequency: during the first years of life and at puberty. The causes of testicular torsion are multiple and are related to a defect in the fixation system of the testicle. Here we report an unusual situation of testicular torsion induced by a large epididymal cyst in a young adult. The cyst was excised as well as bilateral testicular fixation and the patient was discharged on the third day. Clinical examinations and Doppler ultrasound at the sixth and twelfth postoperative weeks were both normal. This observation leads us to consider epididymal cysts as a risk factor for TT."

He was diagnosed with TS based on clinical scoring (Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale) and laboratory markers. Imaging confirmed gastrointestinal perforation. A multidisciplinary team initiated immediate medical stabilization using beta-blockers, antithyroid drugs, corticosteroids, and supportive care. Definitive treatment with laparoscopic repair was performed after clinical optimization under tailored anesthesia. The patient achieved complete recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 10, with normalization of thyroid and inflammatory markers. This case emphasizes the importance of suspecting TS in acute abdomen cases with hyperthyroid history; that cautious surgical delay may be justified to optimize outcomes in TS; and that minimally invasive surgery combined with individualized anesthesia is feasible in this high-risk population."

While omental patch repair remains the standard treatment for duodenal perforations, optimal management of complex gastric perforations, especially those with necrosis or concurrent lesions, remains controversial. We present the case of a 72-year-old Iranian woman with multiple comorbidities who presented with septic shock secondary to gastric perforation. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a 1.5-cm perforation with surrounding necrosis and an adjacent gastric polyp. The patient successfully underwent combined laparoscopic wedge resection and omental patch repair, demonstrating the feasibility of this minimally invasive approach in high-risk patients. The procedure included complete excision of necrotic tissue and polyp with stapled wedge resection, followed by reinforcement using a vascularized omental patch. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with the patient discharged on day 10. Histopathology confirmed benign ulceration without malignancy. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no recurrence. This case highlights that laparoscopic wedge resection with omental patch repair offers both diagnostic and therapeutic advantages for complex gastric perforations, particularly when tissue viability is questionable or concurrent lesions are present. The technique combines the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, reduced morbidity, and faster recovery with the reliability of traditional omental patching.

We have observed that mass-like epididymal enlargement and morphologic changes to the testicular parenchyma differentially represent testes that are viable versus non-viable at the time of scrotal exploration. The purpose of this study is to assess sonographic findings that may help predict the viability of torsed testes at the time of scrotal exploration. We retrospectively reviewed 128 scrotal ultrasound exams of surgically confirmed testicular torsions (88 salvageable, 40 non-salvageable) from July 2022 to July 2023 (mean age 13.1 years, range: 1-19 years). We assessed the visibility of the mediastinum testis, the ratio between affected and non-affected testes of the maximal cross-sectional area of the epididymis on a transverse plane, the ratio between affected and non-affected testes of the testicular volume, and subjective evidence of mass-like epididymal enlargement. Patients with global epididymal enlargement and those with a non-visible mediastinum testis were found to have a statistically higher likelihood of non-salvageable testes (p = 0.0123 and p = 0.0208, respectively). Additionally, a significant association was observed between testicular volume symmetry and the viability of torsed testes (p = 0.0013). Notably, when the volume of the torsed testis exceeded that of the normal contralateral testis by 40 %, it was significantly associated with a non-salvageable outcome (p = 0.0132). Sonographically visible mediastinum testis, absence of epididymal tail enlargement, and similar volume between affected and non-affected testes are potential positive predictors of the viability of the pediatric torsed testes found during emergent testicular salvage surgery. In contrast, the absence of these predictors suggests a non-salvageable testis."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) during pregnancy is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, with high maternal and fetal morbidity. Among the rarest etiologies is ileo-ileal knotting, a rarely encountered surgical emergency with only seven reported cases in pregnancy, including one ileo-ileal knot, as per Shimizu et al. (2014). Its timely diagnosis is often hindered by overlapping obstetric and gastrointestinal symptoms. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman at 25 weeks gestation who experienced severe abdominal pain, distension, and constipation for five days. Initially managed conservatively at a peripheral facility, she suffered a spontaneous fetal loss and was referred to a tertiary center. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an ileo-ileal knot with necrotic bowel, necessitating resection and primary anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was complicated by wound infection but resulted in full recovery with no long-term sequelae. Ileo-ileal knotting results in rapid bowel ischemia and necrosis due to vascular compromise. Risk factors may include pregnancy-related bowel displacement and predisposing anatomical anomalies such as adhesions or Meckel's diverticulum. Diagnosis is often delayed due to atypical presentation and limited access to imaging in low-resource settings. Early surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of management, as delayed treatment significantly increases morbidity and mortality. This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for rare causes of intestinal obstruction in pregnancy. Prompt surgical management can improve maternal and fetal outcomes. In low-resource settings, early clinical decision-making remains essential to preventing complications when advanced diagnostics are unavailable."

Surgical management involved mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa reconstruction using a double-layer bovine pericardial patch within a Commando operation with a modified bio-Bentall procedure and coronary artery reimplantation via a Cabrol procedure. This integrated approach enabled complete debridement of the infected aortic root tissue and successful repair of the mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa defect, highlighting the value of combining these complex techniques in select high-risk reoperative settings."

    "abstract": "Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly with mostly reported cases in neonates, although, in adults, limited cases have been reported in the literature. However, in adults, prompt recognition is of utmost importance to prevent drastic complications like bowel ischemia and death. We present a rare case of coexistence of congenital intestinal malrotation and jejunal diverticula presenting as a volvulus. We present a case of a 78-year-old male with no comorbidities presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen, diagnosed as a case of intestinal obstruction in a virgin abdomen, and treated conservatively. Meanwhile, CT abdomen and pelvis showed volvulus of the small intestine, so the patient was taken for exploratory laparotomy, which revealed the small bowel rotation with a high cecum and a narrow mesentery. Ladd's procedure was performed without any perioperative complications. Few reports of congenital intestinal malrotation in the elderly are presented in the literature. This highlights the importance of evaluating all patients for malrotation if presenting in elderly patients with a virgin acute abdomen to prevent complications like bowel ischemia. Elderly patients presenting with acute intestinal obstruction, if not improving conservatively, should make the clinician think about congenital intestinal malrotation as a differential diagnosis as well, among all other common causes."

    "title": "Ovarian vein thrombosis mimicking acute appendicitis: A case report.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition that most commonly affects postpartum women. It is particularly prevalent in the first 10 days postpartum, a period when women are more prone to developing this condition. The right ovarian vein is often affected due to its tortuous nature and less competent valves. OVT presents similarly to acute abdominal conditions, such as acute appendicitis, especially when the right ovarian vein is involved. Given the overlap in clinical presentation, diagnosis requires high-quality imaging techniques and a high degree of suspicion. Herein, we report a rare case of OVT in a young postpartum female who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen. The patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis treatment. A provisional diagnosis of a perforated appendix was made, and a lower midline exploratory laparotomy was planned. During surgery, the appendix and intestines appeared normal, but a distended and thrombosed right ovarian vein was found. The affected ovarian vein was excised, and the patient was placed on anticoagulants postoperatively. The recovery was unremarkable, and anticoagulants were continued for six months. OVT is most commonly seen in the early postpartum period, especially within the first 10 days. Due to its anatomical characteristics, the right ovarian vein is more commonly involved. The clinical presentation of OVT can closely mimic acute abdomen or acute appendicitis, making diagnosis challenging. Accurate diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and advanced imaging techniques to differentiate OVT from other conditions with similar presentations."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal tumors primarily located in the stomach and small intestine; their occurrence in the terminal ileum is particularly rare. Although GISTs can develop throughout the gastrointestinal tract, cases of perforation in elderly individuals are even less common, posing significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This case report describes an 86-year-old male patient with an acute abdomen caused by a terminal ileum perforated GIST requiring urgent surgical intervention. An immunohistochemical examination of the tumor confirmed a GIST with a GILT (gastrointestinal leiomyogenic tumor) immunophenotype. The rarity of this condition makes it diagnostically challenging, as its symptoms are often nonspecific, and GISTs are frequently overlooked, particularly in older patients. This case supplements the existing literature by emphasizing the importance of considering GIST perforation in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen, even in elderly patients and in rare anatomical locations."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis remains a common surgical emergency with potentially fatal complications. Long-term trends in mortality disparities are not well characterized. We analyzed demographic and regional disparities in appendicitis-related mortality in the United States from 1999 to 2020 using CDC WONDER data. We performed a retrospective analysis of death-certificate data for individuals aged ≥ 25 years, identifying appendicitis-related deaths (ICD-10 K35-K37). Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 population were standardized to the 2000 U.S. Joinpoint regression estimated annual percentage changes (APCs) and average APCs (AAPCs) with 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, urbanization, and state. From 1999 to 2020, 15,243 appendicitis-related deaths occurred (6643 females and 8600 males). Overall AAMR declined from 0.38 to 0.32 per 100,000 (AAPC -1.38% and 95% CI -3.10 to 0.36). A significant decrease occurred from 1999 to 2018 (APC-2.81% and p < 0.0001), followed by a nonsignificant rise. Males exhibited a consistent decline (AAPC -2.88% and p < 0.0001), whereas females experienced an increase from 2016 to 2020 (APC +5.94% and p < 0.0001). Black individuals had the highest AAMR (0.38) but a significant decline (AAPC -3.73% and p < 0.0001) compared to Whites (AAPC -2.49% and p < 0.0001) and Hispanics (AAPC -2.06% and p < 0.0001). Nonmetropolitan areas had higher AAMR (0.34) than metropolitan areas (0.31). Vermont and New Mexico recorded the highest state-level AAMRs; New Jersey and Louisiana had the lowest. Appendicitis-related mortality in the United States declined over two decades; however, rising mortality among females since 2016 and persistent racial and regional disparities underscore the need for targeted interventions to ensure equitable access to timely surgical care."

    "abstract": "India's elderly population is rapidly growing, with 149 million people aged 60 years and above in 2022, projected to double to 347 million by 2050. Diagnosing older adults with acute abdomen in the emergency is challenging due to atypical presentations and poorer outcomes. While Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the abdomen is the imaging test of choice, administration of radiocontrast agents may prove to be a hurdle. Thus, in this prospective observational study, we assessed the utility of CECT abdomen and pelvis in the evaluation of abdominal pain among geriatric patients presenting to the emergency department. This study included 100 patients with a median age of 67 years. Although abdomino-pelvic CECT did not lead to a statistically significant change in diagnosis, it did help identify previously missed life-threatening conditions in some patients. The treatment plan was significantly altered following the CECT scan. While there was no statistically significant change in the overall disposition plan before and after the scan, a considerable proportion of patients (~ 73.7%) initially planned for discharge required admission after undergoing CECT. This study underscores the pivotal role of CECT of the abdomen and pelvis in evaluating geriatric patients presenting to the Emergency Department with acute abdominal symptoms."

    "abstract": "Midgut volvulus, a complication of intestinal malrotation, is a surgical emergency. Due to its embryologic aetiology, it is predominantly seen in neonates; with about 90% of cases involving children under the age of 1. The majority of these are diagnosed within the first month of life. However, midgut volvulus has been reported in adults of varying ages across the literature. We present a case of a 16-year-old girl with generalised but severe abdominal pain in the central and lower abdomen. Ultrasound revealed a clockwise malrotation of the bowel with involvement of the superior mesenteric vessels, in keeping with the 'whirlpool sign'. The proximal duodenum appeared distended. Within the whirlpool, there was evidence of peristalsis in the bowel loops and blood flow in the mesenteric vessels, suggesting a lack of ischaemia in the involved bowel loops. Three months later, the patient was presented to the emergency department with symptoms of vomiting and severe abdominal pain. Computed tomography scan revealed a mesenteric swirl in the mid-abdomen involving the mesenteric vessels, consistent with the previous ultrasound findings of midgut volvulus, and the proximal duodenum remained distended. Midgut volvulus is often overlooked in older children and teenagers presenting with abdominal pain, largely due to its rarity in these age groups. Our case emphasises the importance of clinicians maintaining an open mind and considering imaging, particularly ultrasound, as part of the initial evaluation."

    "abstract": "Splenic rupture is a potentially life-threatening condition and most commonly linked to abdominal or thoracic trauma. When it occurs without trauma, it is termed as spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR). However, it is exceedingly rare and typically occurs secondary to underlying pathological processes. In malaria-endemic regions, Plasmodium infections can cause splenic enlargement and increase the risk of rupture. We present four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture, all occurring in patients with a recent history of malaria treatment. One patient was a 30-year-old previously healthy male from a malaria-endemic region in Ethiopia who presented with acute left upper quadrant abdominal pain, dizziness, and massive hemoperitoneum, requiring an emergency splenectomy. The remaining three patients, although diagnosed with SSR, were hemodynamically stable and managed successfully with conservative treatment, including close monitoring, supportive care, and serial imaging. None of the non-operatively managed patients required surgery during follow-up. SSR due to malaria is rare but more common in endemic areas. Malaria-associated splenic rupture is due to vascular congestion, reticuloendothelial hyperplasia, and a fragile splenic capsule. A high index of suspicion is important in patients with malaria who develop abdominal pain. Such patients need proper abdominal imaging and exclusion of trauma. Treatment depends mainly on hemodynamic stability, with splenectomy reserved for uncontrolled bleeding. Malaria-related spontaneous splenic rupture may present with variable clinical severity. Early recognition, appropriate imaging, and timely surgical intervention are critical for favorable outcomes, particularly in malaria-endemic settings."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder perforation is a rare but serious complication, usually following acute cholecystitis. Spontaneous perforation without prior biliary symptoms is extremely uncommon and often presents as acute peritonitis, especially in the elderly and/or immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. A 76-year-old male with no prior history of gallbladder disease presented with a 3-day history of right upper quadrant pain and signs of generalized peritonitis. Imaging revealed a perforation in the gallbladder fundus with pericholecystic fluid and intraluminal stones. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a 5 mm fundal perforation with 500 ml of bile-stained peritoneal fluid. Cholecystectomy and peritoneal lavage were performed. The patient recovered uneventfully. Spontaneous gallbladder perforation is rare, especially without prior cholecystitis. It most commonly occurs at the fundus due to its limited blood supply, making it susceptible to ischemia. While cholecystitis is more frequent in females, perforation is more common in elderly males. Clinical signs may be nonspecific, and perforation is often diagnosed only via imaging or intraoperatively. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the most sensitive imaging modality, identifying mural defects, pericholecystic fluid, and fat stranding. Laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy with peritoneal lavage remains the mainstay of treatment. Spontaneous gallbladder perforation should be considered in elderly patients with an acute abdomen, even without a history of gallbladder disease. Timely imaging and surgical management are vital for favorable outcomes. Early recognition, appropriate classification, and individualized treatment planning can significantly reduce complications and improve long-term prognosis."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, with complicated cases carrying an increased risk of infections and morbidity. Whilst preoperative antibiotics help reduce infections, the optimal postoperative regimen remains undefined. Variability exists in antibiotic choice, route and duration. This review aimed to examine recent evidence on postoperative antibiotic stewardship for complicated appendicitis to guide optimal treatment strategies. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered in the PROSPERO registry. A search on PubMed and Cochrane library databases identified studies on postoperative antibiotic use in appendicectomy. Two independent reviewers screened studies, including RCTs, cohort studies and observational studies. Data extraction covered study characteristics, interventions and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I, with GRADE used to evaluate evidence certainty. This review included 11 studies with 8361 participants. Shorter intravenous antibiotic courses (2-6 days) were found to be non-inferior to longer regimens in preventing infections and reducing hospital stays. Risk factors for prolonged antibiotic use included disease severity and surgical complexity. In selected patients, oral antibiotics were shown to be equally effective. Shorter intravenous antibiotic courses and early transition to oral antibiotics effectively managed complicated appendicitis, reducing hospital stays and healthcare costs without increasing complications. Individualised treatment decisions based on patient risk factors and intraoperative findings are essential. Tailoring antibiotic regimens to individual patient characteristics remains crucial. These findings support antibiotic stewardship efforts and highlight the need for further research, particularly in high-risk populations."

With the differentiation and development of general surgery sub specialties, department of emergency surgery has begun to emerge, but its development faces various challenges, such as insufficient medical staff, inadequate treatment capabilities, and poor treatment outcomes. To change this situation, about 20 years ago, a new treatment model began to emerge in the United States, establishing a department of acute care surgery that integrates trauma, emergency general surgery, and surgical critical care. This model quickly spread worldwide and achieved remarkable achievements. In recent years, colleagues in the field of surgery in China have gradually recognized the advantages of this model and established acute care surgery. This article aims to elaborate on its development process, current situation, and future trends, providing reference for the prosperous development of acute care surgery in China. 急诊手术一直是普通外科的重要组成部分，主要病种包括急腹症和创伤。随着普通外科亚专业的分化发展，急诊外科开始出现，但是其发展面临种种难题，比如医护人手不足、救治能力不够、治疗效果欠佳等。为了改变这种局面，约20年前美国开始出现新的救治模式，成立融创伤、普通外科急诊手术和外科重症为一体的急重症外科，该模式迅速在全世界范围内得到推广，并取得了令人瞩目的成就。我国外科同道近年来也逐渐认识到该模式的优势，并陆续成立了急重症外科，本文旨在阐述其发展过程、现状及未来趋势，为急重症外科在国内的发展提供参考。."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain in children and is considered the most frequent paediatric surgical emergency. The incidence progresses from extremely low in the neonatal period to a peak incidence between ages 12 and 18 years. Prompt diagnosis and management are imperative to prevent serious complications such as perforation, peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess formation and bowel obstruction. Laparoscopy has improved intra- and post-operative outcomes for children with appendicitis. This study was conducted to evaluate demographics and complications of laparoscopic appendicectomy in Indian children. This is a retrospective cohort study encompassing 714 consecutive patients of appendicitis operated over 15 years (2006-2021) by a single surgeon at a high-volume private paediatric surgical centre in Western India. Data collected included age and gender, duration of surgery and post-operative variables such as length of stay and early or delayed interventions, if any. The patients were categorised into two groups: complicated appendicitis and non-complicated appendicitis, depending on the operative findings. Patients with acutely inflamed appendix without perforation, peritonitis or collection and patients with chronically inflamed appendix were categorised as non-complicated appendicitis. Patients with perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, appendicular lump and appendicitis with intraperitoneal collection were categorised as complicated appendicitis. Additional pathologies found and treated during the surgery were also documented. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 28.0.0.0. The total cohort of patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy in the study was 714. The number of male patients was significantly greater than the female population (P < 0.001). The total number of cases of non-complicated appendicitis was 580 (81.23%). Patients with uncomplicated appendicitis had a mean age of 9.12 ± 3.65 years, while those with complicated appendicitis had a mean age of 7.49 ± 3.58 years. Additional pathologies such as simple ovarian cyst, Meckel's diverticulum and Enterobius vermicularis were found in 11.55% of uncomplicated cases. Post-operative complications were observed to be higher in the complicated group (27.6%) compared to the uncomplicated group (1.72%). This study shows that acute appendicitis affects our study population at a mean age of 8.84 years, with a majority of males (64.14%). It also shows that complicated appendicitis has a higher incidence of post-operative complications of 27.6% and prolonged hospital stay. A multicentre research across various states in India can help establish a clear outlook regarding the demographics of complicated and uncomplicated paediatric appendicitis in the country."

The surgical emergency room (SER) is part of the accident and emergency bay that provides care to patients presenting with acute injuries and non-traumatic surgical complaints. The objective of our study was to investigate the patterns of all diseases presenting to the SER and the differences in treatment and outcomes of patients based on trauma vs. non-trauma complaints. Methods We performed a prospective descriptive study at the SER from March 1, 2023, to March 15, 2023. Patients of all ages and either gender presenting to the SER with any complaint during the data collection period were included. Patients were stratified into two groups: Group T (trauma) and Group NT (non-trauma). These groups were compared for baseline characteristics and outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings. Analyses were conducted to compare trauma vs. non-trauma patients in terms of baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 550 patients were analyzed, with 97 (17.6%) in Group T and 453 (82.4%) in Group NT. The mean ± SD age was 31.1 ± 17.7 years, with a male predominance (n = 352, 64.0%). Abdominal pain was the most common presentation (n = 172, 31.3%), followed by trauma (n = 97, 17.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in baseline characteristics and comorbid conditions between trauma and non-trauma patients (p > 0.05). However, trauma patients more frequently received intravenous (IV) analgesics (T: 75 [77.3%] vs. NT: 135 [29.8%], p < 0.001) and IV fluids (T: 78 [80.4%] vs. NT: 107 [23.6%], p < 0.001). Non-trauma patients received more IV antibiotics (T: 20 [20.6%] vs. NT: 155 [34.2%], p = 0.012) and oral analgesics (T: 45 [46.4%] vs. NT: 280 [61.8%], p = 0.004). Critical interventions were more frequent in the trauma group, including chest intubation (T: 5 [5.2%] vs. NT: 0, p < 0.001) and endotracheal intubation (T: 7 [7.2%] vs. NT: 2 [0.4%], p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the rates of major surgeries (p > 0.05). ICU admissions (T: 25 [25.8%] vs. NT: 10 [2.2%], p < 0.001) and mortality (T: 4 [4.1%] vs. NT: 1 [0.2%], p = 0.003) were higher among trauma patients. Conclusion This study offers a detailed overview of surgical emergencies in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, highlighting patterns that both mirror and differ from international data. Beyond the description of disease presentations, we compare the management strategies and outcomes of patients based on trauma-related versus non-trauma complaints. Our findings may serve as a reference for future research and development of treatment guidelines for surgical emergencies."

A 58-year-old female with 1 month of vague, worsening systemic symptoms and computed tomography findings suspicious for a subcapsular splenic hematoma was found to have splenic rupture. After undergoing emergency laparotomy with splenectomy, pathological samples revealed metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. During a subsequent admission, she was found to be hemodynamically unstable, deemed a poor candidate for inpatient chemotherapy, and elected to proceed with comfort measures after which she died from multiorgan failure 3 weeks after initial presentation. Spontaneous (nontraumatic) splenic hemorrhage secondary to metastasis should remain a differential diagnosis for patients with acute abdomen and associated risk factors for primary malignancies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Littre's hernia is a rare entity defined as the herniation of a Meckel's diverticulum through a defect in the abdominal wall. Although Meckel's diverticulum occurs in up to 2% of the population, its manifestation within a hernia is extremely rare, comprising around 1% of Meckel's cases. This report describes the case of a 32-year-old man presenting as an emergency with lower abdominal pain and a diagnosis of Littre's hernia. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of lower abdominal pain and periumbilical erythema. Clinical examination revealed an irreducible umbilical hernia. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and elevated CRP. A CT scan suggested an incarcerated hernia with signs of ischemia, but no clear identification of Meckel's diverticulum. Diagnostic laparoscopy followed by mini-laparotomy revealed a necrotic Meckel's diverticulum 110 cm proximal to the ileo-cecal valve. A stapled diverticulectomy was performed without mesh repair due to contamination. The wound was managed with a vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) system. The postoperative course was uneventful, and histopathology confirmed necrotizing inflammation without malignancy. CONCLUSIONS Littre's hernia is a rare but important differential diagnosis in abdominal wall hernias and can present symptomatically as an acute abdomen. This case highlights the presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management of an atypical umbilical Littre's hernia and reinforces the value of prompt surgical exploration and intraoperative assessment to avoid ischemic complications."

The cohort was divided into two groups: patients treated by colorectal surgeons (CSs) and those who were treated by general surgeons (GSs). Demographic data, operative variables, and postoperative results were analyzed and compared between groups. A total of 241 patients presented with a PA; 69 (28.6%) were operated by CS and 172 (71.4%) by GS. The detection rate of an underlying fistula was greater in the CS group compared to the GS group. Definitive treatment for fistulas was more frequent among CS (34.8% versus 16.8% P = 0.002). The need of a deferred procedure for fistula treatment (CS: 10.5% versus GS: 21.9%, P = 0.1), recurrence rate (CS: 5% versus GS: 12.2%, P = 0.2), readmissions (CS: 4.3% versus GS: 5.2%, P = 0.77), and reoperations rates (CS: 8.8% versus GS: 7.5% P = 0.7) were similar between groups. No differences were observed in the incontinence rate between groups (CS: 2.9% versus GS: 4.1%, P = 0.6). Intraoperative diagnosis and definitive treatment of underlying fistula was more common among CSs.

Use of antiplatelet drugs and platelet dysfunction exacerbate the already high rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between preoperative platelet function evaluated through Multiplate® aggregometry and transfusion requirement. This observational retrospective study included 180 patients who underwent emergency surgical repair of ATAAD over a two-year period (2019-2021). Platelet function was evaluated preoperatively using Multiplate® analyzer with three activators: adenosine diphosphate (ADP test), arachidonic acid (ASPI test) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide-6 (TRAP test). Primary outcome was the number of blood products transfused. In addition, the need for surgical re-exploration, length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality were compared. Abnormal aggregation responses were observed in 89 (49.2%) patients using ASPI test, in 47 (26%) patients using ADP test, and in 113 (63.5%) patients using the TRAP test. Thirty-six (20%) patients exhibited an abnormal response to all three tests. Preoperative use of aspirin was documented in 35 (19.3%) patients, while clopidogrel use was documented in 7 (3.9%) patients. Patients with anormal ADP responses required more intraoperative red cell concentrates (3.4 ± 3.9 versus 2.1 ± 3.2, p = 0.039), intraoperative platelet concentrates (4.2 ± 2.9 versus 3.1 ± 2.4, p = 0.015) and total platelet concentrates (8.1 ± 7.8 versus 6.2 ± 8.1, p = 0.008). There were no significant differences in the need for surgical re-exploration, the total length of hospital stay, or 30-day mortality. Multiplate® aggregometry can be a useful tool for evaluating platelet dysfunction and assessing transfusion need in ATAAD patients, thereby aiding in the optimization of treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency today. Blunt abdominal trauma is a rare etiology of appendicitis, with a reported incidence of 0.3-0.9 %. Traumatic appendicitis is more common in the pediatric population, with a median age of 11.5 years. We present the case of a 13-year-old healthy female who presented as a trauma activation after a motor vehicle collision. Clinical examination revealed ecchymoses and abrasions over bilateral hips consistent with a seatbelt sign, with tenderness in the periumbilical region and right lower quadrant. Imaging was consistent with developing appendicitis. The patient was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic appendectomy; a long, dilated, and inflamed appendix was identified intraoperatively. She did well postoperatively and was discharged home from the post-anesthesia care unit. It is important to maintain a high clinical index of suspicion for appendicitis and similar diagnoses when evaluating the pediatric trauma patient."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric shear, injury due to sudden stretch of the mesentery, is a rare condition that remains poorly studied, especially in the pediatric population. Often resulting from trauma, its presentation can vary from nonspecific and vague abdominal symptoms to an acute abdomen and peritonitis requiring urgent surgical intervention. Unified management strategies are not yet in place. We describe the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain of 1 day duration, 2 days after he sustained blunt abdominal trauma with an elbow during a soccer match. He was hemodynamically and clinically stable. Computed tomography scan revealed soft tissue thickening in the left upper quadrant at the root of the mesentery with mild surrounding inflammatory mesenteric fat stranding, suggesting mesenteric shearing. With stable vitals, a soft abdomen on physical exam, and no drop in hemoglobin, the decision was made to treat the patient conservatively. The patient was admitted for observation, and after frequent abdominal exams, stable laboratory results, and abdominal imaging, he was discharged home without any surgical intervention. Conservative management can be successful in the case of a stable patient without alarming physical, laboratory, or imaging findings. Observation and close monitoring remain essential to detect complicated cases that require surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a surgical emergency that, if not promptly treated, can lead to muscle necrosis, limb loss, or death. Although disproportionate pain is traditionally considered the hallmark symptom, atypical presentations without pain have been described. We report the case of a 42-year-old male who sustained multiple traumatic injuries in a motorcycle-vehicle collision and subsequently developed silent compartment syndrome in the left thigh and leg. Despite being conscious and neurologically intact, the patient did not report significant pain at any point. The diagnosis was suspected based on objective findings, including tense edema, absent distal pulses, and progressive motor dysfunction. Invasive compartment pressure measurements confirmed the diagnosis, leading to urgent fasciotomies and intensive care management, including renal replacement therapy. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for ACS in patients with major trauma, even in the absence of pain, and supports early intervention to prevent irreversible sequelae."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of multiple gas-filled cysts located beneath the intestinal submucosa or plasma membrane. The pathogenesis of PCI remains incompletely understood, and its clinical presentation lacks specificity. A 69-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of abdominal distension, abdominal pain lasting over 2 weeks, and altered consciousness for 3 days. She had a two-year history of mixed connective tissue disease and was undergoing regular hormone therapy. Upon admission, she demonstrated signs of peritoneal irritation, and computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of multiple free air pockets within the abdominal cavity, as well as \"bead-like\" translucent areas within the intestinal wall. An emergency abdominal exploration revealed extensive gas accumulation in the wall of the small intestine and multiple gas bubbles in the mesentery. Subsequently, resection and anastomosis of the affected intestinal section were performed. Postoperative pathology identified multiple non-endothelial cystic cavities within the submucosa and muscularis propria of this segment of the small intestine, with Escherichia coli and Phocaeicola vulgatus detected in the affected intestinal wall. The patient was further treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after surgery, but following a brief period of improvement, she developed a lung infection and unfortunately passed away. This case report demonstrates the diagnostic difficulties in patients with peritonitis with abdominal free gas in intestinal gas cysts, reveals the potential role of abnormal intestinal flora, especially the never reported colonization by Phocaeicola vulgatus, in the development of PCI combined with abdominal free gas."

    "title": "Spontaneous Isolated Symptomatic Celiac Artery Dissection: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "The celiac artery, also known as the celiac trunk, originates from the abdominal aorta at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra. Arising from the anterior aorta, this ultrashort artery plays an integral role in supplying blood to the stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, and proximal duodenum. Arterial dissection is a life-threatening emergency most frequently reported in the aorta, while visceral arterial dissections remain uncommon or may be undetected. A dissection involves a tear in the artery wall, which can lead to serious complications, including compromised arterial supply, end-organ ischemia, and rupture. Spontaneous dissection of the celiac artery is a rare vascular disease. Most patients are asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed on abdominal imaging, but can present as acute abdominal pain. A dissection of the celiac trunk could potentially lead to a disruption in the perfusion of the pancreas, liver, and stomach with subsequent development of ischemia, inflammation, and infarction. This is, however, an uncommon event and has been described only in very few cases in the past. Our case describes this uncommon presentation, a patient with features of pancreatitis and hepatitis in the setting of a celiac artery dissection, likely related to ischemia. The diagnosis of celiac artery dissection relies on computerized tomography (CT) with contrast, preferably with angiography. Medical management, endovascular therapy with stents and rarely surgical reconstruction, or bypass could be employed for treating symptomatic patients. Ironically, endovascular treatment for cardiac and vascular diseases has emerged as a frequent culprit in the causation of arterial dissection: iatrogenic arterial dissection."

We report the case of a 57-year-old male from Ethiopia who presented with classical features of SBO, including abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and failure to pass stool and flatus. Imaging was inconclusive, and an exploratory laparotomy revealed appendico-ileal knotting involving the terminal ileum. The bowel was viable, and a simple appendectomy was performed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative Day 5. Histopathology confirmed acute appendicitis with mucocele. This case underscores the diagnostic challenge of this rare condition and emphasizes the need for early surgical intervention to avoid complications."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess acute abdominal pain presentation in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department. This is a retrospective study in which data was collected from electronic medical records. Presentations, associated symptoms, findings on physical examination, documented diagnostic tests, and outcomes of patients were collected and examined. Two multivariate analysis models were used to investigate factors associated with acute medical abdomen and acute surgical abdomen. Out of 2,169 visits during the study period, 235 (10.8%) patients presented with acute abdominal pain. Forty-five (19%) patients had a surgical abdomen, while the remaining had an acute medical abdomen. The most prevalent diagnosis was \"non-specific abdominal pain\", constituting 61 (26%) patients. Both leukocytosis (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.03-0.51; p = 0.006) and right lower quadrant pain (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08-0.81; p = 0.021) were inversely associated with an acute surgical abdomen and were more suggestive of an acute medical abdomen. In contrast, right lower quadrant pain (OR: 13.9; 95% CI: 5.03-43.5; p < 0.001), leukocytosis (OR: 3.26; 95% CI: 1.07-11.1; p = 0.045), and neutrophilia (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09; p = 0.031) were found to be significantly associated with acute appendicitis. Pediatric patients' presentations to the emergency department exhibit a diversity of presentations, and diagnostics may be less evident compared to adult patients. Right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis may be more indicative of a non-surgical abdomen rather than a surgical abdomen among different diagnoses that require surgical intervention. However, right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis are still strongly associated with acute appendicitis out of different surgical diagnoses. To combine both findings, our conclusion is that right lower quadrant pain and leukocytosis are more predictive of an acute medical abdomen, but only when appendicitis is less likely to be one of the differential diagnoses. These findings challenge conventional clinical paradigms, suggesting that right lower quadrant pain could be a stronger predictor of medical conditions, which typically do not require surgical intervention."

Surgical exploration revealed no major injuries, and recovery was initially uneventful. However, 48 hr later, the patient developed signs of acute abdomen, prompting an exploratory laparotomy that uncovered 150-180 cm of ischemic small bowel and pale, patchy lesions suggestive of vasculitis. Histopathology confirmed necrotizing vasculitis of small and medium vessels. This case illustrates how an incidental trauma led to the diagnosis of a silent but life-threatening systemic disease. The coexistence of vascular trauma and spontaneous ischemic bowel highlights the importance of considering systemic vasculitides in patients with unexplained abdominal findings, even when presenting with an unrelated surgical emergency."

It occurred when the ileum twisting around the sigmoid colon and causing intestinal obstruction and potential perforation. A 60-year-old male from the Garbo region of Somali, Ethiopia, presented to the hospital after a a four-day history of intestinal obstruction symptoms. On examination, he was tachycardic and febrile, and exhibited diffuse abdominal tenderness. A diagnosis of intestinal obstruction with generalized peritonitis was made after abdominal x ray. The patient was resuscitated with fluids, started on antibiotics, and a nasogastric tube was placed. Emergency laparotomy revealed ileosigmoid knotting with gangrenous bowel. En bloc resection of the affected ileum and sigmoid colon was performed. An ileo-jejunal anastomosis and an end colostomy were constructed. Despite these interventions, the patient succumbed to uncontrolled sepsis on the fourth postoperative day. Ileosigmoid knotting (ISK), a rare and deadly form of intestinal obstruction, is more common in the \"volvulus belt\" regions like Africa and parts of Asia. It involves a twisted knot of the ileum and sigmoid colon and can be caused by factors like a narrow mesentery or hypermobile ileum. ISK is difficult to diagnose with standard tests and often requires surgical exploration. The mortality is high (up to 48 %), especially in resource-limited settings due to various challenges. Ileosigmoid knotting is a rare and dangerous cause of intestinal obstruction requiring quick action. Poor outcomes are common, especially in resource-limited areas like Ethiopia due to late presentation and limited healthcare resources."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, predominantly affecting young males. Although laparoscopic appendectomy reduces adverse outcomes, potential complications related to this condition are known. Among these, hepatic abscess is a rare and severe complication, with limited cases reported in the literature. Case Report: We report a case of an 18-years-old male with diffuse purulent peritonitis due to perforated appendicitis who developed a hepatic abscess one month post-surgery. Despite the initial management including surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy, after one month the patient presented with high temperature and right upper quadrant pain, leading to the discovery and subsequent percutaneous drainage of a hepatic abscess and intravenous antibiotic therapy. The abscess culture identified Bacteroides Fragilis, guiding targeted antibiotic therapy and resulting in a full recovery. Discussion: This case highlights the potential for hepatic abscess formation following acute appendicitis, suspected to arise from hematogenous bacterial spread. Given the uncommon nature of this complication, a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with unusual symptoms post-appendectomy is required. Immediate percutaneous drainage alongside broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, followed by targeted treatment upon pathogen identification, is crucial for managing this life-threatening condition. Conclusion: Although rare, hepatic abscess can occur as a complication of acute appendicitis, underscoring the importance of awareness and prompt intervention to prevent severe outcomes. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess associated to a targeted antibiotic therapy represents the treatment of choice."

This case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in managing SRAD, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. A 35-year-old male with a history of left renal artery stenosis treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 5 years prior presented with sudden right flank pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness and hypertension. Laboratory tests showed elevated homocysteine (27.8 μmol/L). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed the presence of a longitudinal intimal flap in the main trunk of the right renal artery with complete distal occlusion and extensive renal infarction. No signs of aortic coarctation, mesenteric ischemia, or pulmonary embolism were found. Emergency balloon angioplasty and stent implantation were performed. Postprocedure angiography showed partial recanalization of the main renal artery trunk but persistent distal branch occlusion. Despite intervention, the patient deteriorated rapidly, developing cardiac arrest, metabolic acidosis (pH 7.06, Lac 13.8 mmol/L), and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Resuscitation efforts failed, and the patient was declared dead 13 hours postadmission. SRAD mimics acute abdomen or hypertensive crisis, requiring high clinical suspicion in patients with renovascular history. Endovascular intervention improved proximal flow but failed to restore distal perfusion, highlighting anatomical complexity. Chronic medial degeneration (evidenced by restenosis history) may predispose to acute dissection progression. Integration of imaging, laboratory trends, and surgical consultation is critical for timely intervention."

Significant gaps in knowledge and attitudes among nurses can hinder effective pain management, patient outcomes, and satisfaction. Purpose: This study assesses nurses' knowledge and attitudes regarding pain assessment and management. Methods: A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. Convenience sampling was used to recruit 161 registered nurses from various wards at a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between January and April 2024. Data were collected using the Knowledge and Attitude Survey Regarding Pain (KASRP) and analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and independent t-tests. Results: The nurses' knowledge and attitudes regarding pain were moderate (M = 25.62, SD ± 6.4). Less than a quarter of participants demonstrated a good level according to the KASRP (22.36%). The score was greater among nurses working in surgical, emergency, and hemodialysis units (F = 2.47, p=0.03), those with good perceived competency levels in pain management (t = 3.41, p < 0.001) and knew about the availability of pain management protocols in the unit (t = 2.81, p=0.003). Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for enhanced educational strategies to improve nurses' knowledge of pain assessment and pharmacological interventions, and to address misconceptions about opioid use and opioid dependency, as well as the ethical implications of placebo use.

Between June 2021 and June 2023, 100 patients with acute abdomen (85 with acute appendicitis) were randomly assigned to a control group (routine nursing care, n = 50) or an emergency care (EC) group (graded emergency intervention, n = 50). Graded emergency nursing intervention was implemented based on the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) version 4, which stratifies patients from Level I (life-threatening) to Level V (non-urgent). The EC group received structured emergency triage by trained nursing teams, including systematic protocols for patient observation, inquiry, physical examination, and condition analysis. Outcomes included emergency care efficiency indicators (consultation time, examination time, emergency department stay, trauma control time, hospital stay), complication rates (e.g., abdominal infection, hemorrhage, puncture site infection, subcutaneous emphysema), clinical symptom recovery (abdominal pain duration, gastrointestinal recovery time), and nursing satisfaction scores. Data were analyzed using t-tests and chi-square tests via SPSS 21.0, with significance set at p < 0.05. The EC group showed significantly lower rates of in-hospital complications (2% vs. 14%, p < 0.05), faster clinical response times (shorter consultation and examination times, reduced emergency department and hospital stay durations), and quicker symptom recovery compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Nursing satisfaction scores were also significantly higher in the EC group (p < 0.05). Graded emergency nursing intervention-based on triage acuity, structured symptom assessment, and trained response teams-effectively reduces the incidence of complications, enhances emergency response efficiency, shortens recovery and hospital stay durations, and improves patient satisfaction. This approach is clinically valuable and recommended for broader implementation."

In a multicenter cohort study of adult-type granulosa cell tumors, women presenting with an acute abdomen at diagnosis were identified (Brink, 2025). After informed consent, clinical data were retrieved from patient records and collected in a Castor EDC database. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the subgroup of women with acute abdomen with the remainder of the adult type granulosa cell tumor cohort. Twenty-six out of 208 (12.5%) patients had an acute abdomen as presenting symptom of an adult-type granulosa cell tumor. All patients underwent emergency abdominal surgery. In 16 (62%) patients, the tumor mass was found to be ruptured pre-operatively, and 7 (27%) patients had an ovarian torsion. Seventeen patients (65%) of this group developed recurrent disease. When compared with the rest of the adult-type granulosa cell tumor cohort, patients with an acute abdomen at diagnosis were younger, had significantly more perioperative blood loss, and more often developed a recurrence. Adult-type granulosa cell tumors present with an acute abdomen in over 10% of the cases. In case of an ovarian mass or hemoperitoneum in women with an acute abdomen, a granulosa cell tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Surgery can then be performed with a more oncological approach, striving to avoid spill and thus decrease the risk of recurrence."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors to affect the digestive tract. These tumors arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal. Although the majority of GISTs occur in the stomach, they can arise anywhere along the GI tract, including the small intestine, colon, esophagus, and very rarely from extra intestinal locations. GISTs mainly affect older adults, with a slight male preponderance. Small size GISTs can be discovered incidentally during imaging or endoscopy. Symptoms vary depending on the location and size of the tumor, those related to the tumor mass effect (abdominal pain, discomfort, distension and a palpable mass), or others presenting with anemia and GI hemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced abdomino-pelvic CT scan is the investigation of choice for staging and follow-up. GISTs are distinguished from other tumors using immunohistochemical test positivity for CD 117and CD 34. Surgery is the standard treatment for localized GISTs followed by risk stratification. Adjuvant imatinib should be considered in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs. Here we describe a series of GISTs presenting at atypical locations, unique presentations, and atypical histologic variants. The first case was a 35-years old female patient who underwent an emergency laparotomy for small bowel obstruction and later diagnosed to have a mesenteric GIST (an extraintestinal GIST). The second case was a 60-year-old male patient who underwent an emergency laparotomy for a small bowel obstruction secondary to an intrabdominal mass and later diagnosed to have a jejunal GIST. The third case was a 72 years old male patient who underwent exploratory laparotomy for gastro-gastric intussusception secondary to gastric GIST. The fourth case was a 55 years old male patient who underwent exploratory laparotomy for gastric GIST with liver secondaries. In immunohistochemistry examination, all were positive for CD 117. Clinical presentation of GISTs depend on the tumor size and location. Small tumors are usually asymptomatic. If symptomatic, the most common clinical manifestations are features of anemia, GI bleeding, compressive symptoms, and intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis of GIST is confirmed using tissue histology and immunohistochemistry tests. Even though GIST constitutes the smallest portion of GI neoplasms, physicians need to have high index of suspicion for it in patients presenting with vague abdominal pain and consider abdominopelvic CT as part of patients' work up."

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), primarily recognized as a pulmonary disease, can manifest in various extrapulmonary forms, with abdominal tuberculosis (ATB) being one of the most common. Abdominal tuberculosis is one of the diseases known as \"the great imitator\" - it can mimic the clinical presentation of various diseases that are more common, such as appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, colitis, and some malignant diseases such as colon or stomach neoplasms. Diagnosis of ATB is often delayed, especially if a clinician in a nonendemic country does not include ATB in the differential diagnosis. Given the rising migration of people from the endemic to the nonendemic countries, we believe it is mandatory to raise consciousness about this clinical entity, as well as to lower a threshold to include ATB in the differential diagnosis. We present a case of a 31-year-old patient from Nepal, who was admitted through the emergency department of General Hospital Zabok, Croatia, with signs of acute abdomen, later successfully diagnosed and treated for ATB. We also deliver a brief literature review, summarizing the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for ATB. Migrations are inevitably changing the vaccination status and epidemiological risks of any host country. Medical personnel should keep upgrading and revising their knowledge of the \"usual suspects\" whilst differentially diagnosing both immigrants and non-immigrants, in order to make timely and good quality diagnosis and treatment."

    "title": "Retrospective analysis of computed tomography examinations in patients with lower abdominal pain: A single-center experience.",
    "abstract": "Lower abdominal pain presents as a common complaint with diverse etiologies ranging from benign conditions to surgical emergencies. Computed tomography (CT) imaging has become instrumental in accurate diagnosis and management planning, though clinicians must carefully balance its benefits against radiation exposure concerns and resource allocation constraints. To comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, utility and clinical implications of CT in patients with acute lower abdominal pain, emphasizing rare anatomical variations, pregnancy-related issues, and practical limitations of other imaging modalities in emergency settings in Japan. This retrospective review included 230 patients who underwent CT scans for acute lower abdominal pain at Juntendo University Shizuoka Hospital throughout 2014. CT findings were systematically correlated with the final clinical diagnoses. Cases with diagnostic uncertain underwent independent reviewed by two experienced radiologists. The CT protocols included portal venous-phase imaging with selective arterial-phase acquisition when clinically indicated. Idiopathic pain was the most common diagnosis (104 cases, 45.2%), followed by appendicitis (46 cases, 20.0%) and diverticulitis (27 cases, 11.7%). Right lower quadrant pain predominantly revealed appendicitis (20.2%), whereas left lower quadrant pain frequently indicated diverticulitis (12.1%). Nonspecific pain cases have diverse etiologies. Rare conditions included situs inversus (one case) and intestinal malrotation (one case). Pregnancy-related diagnoses included acute appendicitis and uterine fibroid degeneration. CT significantly aids in the diagnosis of lower abdominal pain, especially given limited access to ultrasonography and MRI during emergency hours in Japan. Awareness of the anatomical variations and pregnancy-related constraints is crucial. Diagnosis-specific protocols for CT based on pain location can optimize clinical management and resource utilization."

    "title": "Small Bowel Strangulation in an Adult From an Internal Hernia Caused by a Rare Congenital Mesenteric Defect.",
    "abstract": "Internal hernia occurs when a portion of the bowel herniates through a congenital or acquired opening within the abdominal cavity. This can lead to small bowel obstruction, bowel incarceration, and strangulation. We present a rare case of an adult patient presenting with an acute abdomen caused by small bowel strangulation due to a congenital transmesenteric defect. A 67-year-old female without any significant past medical or surgical history presented to the emergency department with an acute-onset worsening abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed pain out of proportion to palpation of the abdomen. CT demonstrated internal hernia with moderate-volume ascites, concerning for ischemic bowel. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which demonstrated an internal hernia through a congenital mesenteric defect in the right hemiabdomen near the root of the mesentery with ischemic small bowel requiring resection. The patient was left in intestinal discontinuity and was returned for reexploration of the abdomen, open cholecystectomy, and right hemicolectomy. The patient's recovery and hospital course were uncomplicated, and she was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day five. The incidence of congenital mesenteric defects in adults is exceedingly low, resulting in a limited body of literature addressing their clinical presentation and complications. Timely and accurate preoperative diagnosis is critical to prevent acute obstruction and strangulation of the bowel. This case contributes valuable insights into the diagnosis and management of this uncommon condition."

    "abstract": "Epididymo-orchitis (EO) is rare in infants, and associated hydrocele at presentation indicates an advanced stage of infection. It is commonly associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and can be a clue to the presence of underlying congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that can mimic EO and should be ruled out at presentation. Here, we present a six-month-old male infant who was brought in with complaints of passage of pinkish urine, pus discharge per urethra for two days, and fever for one day. He also had a history of excessive crying during micturition for the past seven days. On examination, he was febrile, and head-to-toe examination revealed an acute left scrotum with hydrocele. Prehn's sign was negative on the left side, and the cremasteric reflex was absent bilaterally. Urinalysis was ordered along with culture, which showed plenty of pus cells and a few red blood cells. Ultrasound with Doppler (USG Doppler) was done immediately, which ruled out torsion and hernia but showed an inflamed epididymis and left mild hydronephrosis (HDN) with trabeculated bladder wall and internal echoes. The infant was started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics for suspected UTI with poor oral intake, and he promptly improved in the next 48 hours. Urine culture grew Escherichia coli, and an antibiotic course was given for 10 days. A follow-up micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) revealed grade III left side vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), for which he was started on antibiotic prophylaxis, and his technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc-99m DMSA) scan was normal. He is currently under periodic follow-up for his VUR. This case emphasizes the timely detection of complicated UTIs in infants. Torsion should always be ruled out in infants presenting with acute scrotum."

    "abstract": "Delirium, a significant complication in older patients, often occurs during hospitalization and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Effective strategies to prevent delirium are essential, particularly in emergency department (ED) settings where older patients frequently present with acute abdominal conditions. This study evaluated the impact of high-dose intravenous acetaminophen (≥ 1,000 mg) on the onset of delirium in older patients. This retrospective cohort study included 411 patients aged 70 years or older diagnosed with acute abdomen at the ED of Tosei General Hospital from October 2015 to December 2022. Patients were divided into high-dose (≥ 1,000 mg/administration) and low-dose (< 1,000 mg/administration) groups based on acetaminophen dosage. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for confounding factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, sensory impairments, and serum albumin levels. Of the 411 patients included in this study, 53 (12.9%) developed delirium during hospitalization, with the high-dose acetaminophen group demonstrating a significantly lower risk of delirium onset than that of the low-dose group (odds ratio: 0.391; 95% confidence interval: 0.193-0.791). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the protective effect of high-dose acetaminophen treatment after adjusting for potential confounding factors, suggesting this treatment protocol as a promising therapeutic approach for preventing delirium in older patients with acute abdominal conditions. High-dose intravenous acetaminophen may effectively reduce the risk of delirium onset in older patients hospitalized with acute abdomen. These findings suggest a valuable role for high-dose acetaminophen in improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of delirium in emergency and hospital care. Retrospectively registered."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is a common presentation in the emergency department, requiring prompt evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. This case report highlights how simple diagnostic tools can facilitate early detection of abdominal pain caused by duodenal perforation-a rare complication in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. We present a novel case of a 62-year-old male with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who developed acute abdominal pain. The diagnosis of intestinal perforation was made at a Specialist Palliative Care clinic within a tertiary cancer centre. An erect abdominal X-ray revealed free air under the diaphragm, pointing to bowel perforation. The patient underwent emergency surgical exploration, which confirmed a duodenal perforation and was managed with a palliative gastrojejunostomy. While point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was not used in this case, we emphasize its potential utility as a bedside tool in the emergency setting for early evaluation of acute abdomen. It can aid in differentiating between conditions such as bowel obstruction, perforation, intussusception, abscesses, or large masses compressing vital structures-many of which may not be visible on a plain abdominal X-ray. This case underscores the importance of early clinical evaluation and the use of accessible diagnostic tools (POCUS) in the timely management of acute abdomen, particularly in complex cancer cases."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, but its diagnosis can be challenging in patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia due to an impaired inflammatory response. The clinical presentation of acute appendicitis in these patients is often atypical, leading to delayed or misdiagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of appendectomy in patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia and assess the applicability of clinical scoring systems for the diagnosis of an acute appendicitis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-related leukopenia who underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis between 2007 and 2023. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results were reviewed. The accuracy and relevance of clinical scoring systems for diagnosing acute appendicitis in these patients were also evaluated. Our study included 12 patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia who underwent appendectomy. Atypical clinical presentations were common, with a lower frequency of fever, elevated leukocytes, and other typical inflammatory markers. Only one patient developed postoperative complications (acute kidney failure), and none of the patients died due to appendicitis. Clinical scoring systems demonstrated limited applicability in this patient population, often underestimating the likelihood of appendicitis. Diagnosing acute appendicitis in patients with hematologic malignancies or chemotherapy-induced leukopenia poses significant challenges, as standard scoring systems prove unreliable. The presence of abdominal pain coupled with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels should prompt a multidisciplinary evaluation and timely imaging. Surgical therapies, particularly laparoscopic approaches, appear safe and feasible in these patients. Ongoing research is essential to refine surgical strategies for the growing population of immunocompromised individuals."

    "abstract": "Complications of peptic ulcers, such as bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, and perforation, can be life-threatening and may require surgical intervention. Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) presents mostly as a surgical emergency and is one of the leading causes of secondary peritonitis with significant morbidity and mortality. The clinical outcome of surgical treatment of peptic ulcers varies due to the varying patterns of presentations and interventions between countries. There are few documented series on PPU in Nigeria. This paper reviews the management outcome of PPU in our institution. A retrospective review of the available medical records of patients managed for PPU between February 2008 and February 2023 was conducted. All patients had a single anterior peptic ulcer perforation managed by a modified Graham's patch. Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS for Windows, Version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). There were 107 PPU patients comprising 93 males and 14 females. The mean age of all patients was 41 years. The peak prevalence of PPU was found among patients aged 30-39 years. Delayed presentation was recorded in about half of the patients. Ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was the most common risk factor for PPU. Among the 93 documented cases, perforated gastric ulcers (71 cases) were found in a much higher proportion than duodenal ulcers (22 cases). Large ulcer (10-30 mm) was the main perforation size category found in 47 out of 83 recorded PPU cases. PPU size was not associated with the incidence of complications or mortality. The median duration of hospital stays was 13 (1-19) days. Surgical site infection was the most common complication after surgery. PPU is present in our predominantly male patients in their fourth decade of life. Ingestion of NSAIDs is a major risk factor. Duodenal ulcers were the predominant type seen in our patients. Documented perforated ulcer sizes in our patients are predominantly in the large category. Surgical site infection, systemic sepsis, and superficial wound infection were major complications in our patients."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, most often caused by luminal obstruction from fecaliths. Rarely, foreign body ingestion can lead to appendicitis, particularly when small objects like lead shot become lodged in the appendix. We present the case of a 30-year-old man with chronic intermittent right lower quadrant pain who presented with an acute exacerbation. Imaging revealed two metallic densities in the appendix without overt signs of inflammation. He underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, which confirmed the presence of two retained lead pellets and histologic evidence of acute appendicitis. The patient had a history of frequent game meat consumption. This case underscores a rare but important etiology of appendicitis and the potential for systemic lead exposure from retained foreign bodies. In patients with relevant social histories and suggestive imaging, clinicians should consider this diagnosis and proceed with timely surgical management to prevent complications."

    "title": "Two-Stage Gastrectomy Improves Outcomes in Perforated Gastric Cancer: A Single-Institution Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Perforated gastric cancer (PGC) is a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency. Due to its low reported incidence and significant challenges in the preoperative diagnosis of malignancy, there is no established consensus on optimal management. Recent evidence suggests that a two-stage surgical strategy, involving initial damage control followed by delayed curative resection, may reduce morbidity and mortality while improving oncological outcomes. Preoperative diagnosis of malignancy is uncommon, and the utility of routine intraoperative biopsy has been questioned, highlighting the importance of postoperative endoscopic biopsy for definitive diagnosis. This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a two-stage surgical strategy for PGC, emphasizing its adaptability and outcomes based on a 27-year retrospective analysis at a single institution. We retrospectively reviewed 62 cases of gastric perforation treated between 1998 and October 2023. Among them, nine cases were pathologically confirmed as PGC. Initial management involved conservative therapy or omental patch repair (via laparotomy or laparoscopy) aimed at stabilizing the patient's condition and managing peritonitis. Following malignancy confirmation (often by postoperative biopsy) and clinical stabilization, elective curative gastrectomy with appropriate lymphadenectomy was planned for eligible patients. Postoperative outcomes, including complications (graded by Clavien-Dindo), curative resection rates, and survival, were analyzed. Of the nine PGC patients (median age 74 years), none were diagnosed preoperatively. Initial management included conservative therapy (n=3), open omental patch repair (n=3), and laparoscopic omental patch repair (n=3). No Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher complications were observed following initial management. Eight patients subsequently underwent gastrectomy, with seven achieving R0 resection. One patient succumbed to cancer progression during hospitalization prior to the planned gastrectomy. For the seven patients who underwent R0 resection, the median follow-up was 24 months (range: 12-56 months). At the final data cut-off (April 2025), three of these seven R0 patients were alive and disease-free; one had died from cancer recurrence, and three were lost to follow-up while alive. Notably, one complex case with initial peritoneal dissemination (Case 6) successfully underwent delayed radical resection after chemotherapy, illustrating the strategy's adaptability. Conversely, Case 7 exemplified a straightforward and successful two-stage laparoscopic approach, resulting in long-term disease-free survival. This patient is one of the three currently alive. This retrospective study suggests that a two-stage surgical strategy, involving initial stabilization followed by elective curative gastrectomy, is a safe and effective approach for managing PGC. It achieved high rates of R0 resection with low morbidity and demonstrated promising survival outcomes in this high-risk cohort. Further multicenter prospective studies are needed to establish standardized protocols and validate patient selection criteria."

    "abstract": "We describe a rare case involving the spontaneous rupture of the spleen in a man in his mid-70s who initially came to the emergency department with progressively worsening shortness of breath, a productive cough with yellow-green sputum, and chest pain worsened by breathing. He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia. However, shortly after admission, he rapidly deteriorated, developing severe abdominal pain, a sudden drop in blood pressure, and a significant decrease in hemoglobin, indicating acute internal bleeding. An urgent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed extensive bleeding around his spleen, consistent with spontaneous rupture, likely due to increased abdominal pressure from intense coughing. The patient underwent emergency surgery to remove his spleen and evacuate blood from the abdomen, followed by care in the intensive care unit. His recovery afterward was smooth, and he gradually improved without further complications. This case highlights the need for doctors to remain alert to spontaneous splenic rupture when patients with respiratory infections develop unexplained abdominal symptoms and internal bleeding. Early diagnosis and rapid surgical treatment proved essential in ensuring a positive outcome for this patient."

    "abstract": "Gastric volvulus (GV) is an uncommon surgical emergency characterized by abnormal rotation of the stomach, often leading to obstruction and ischemia. It is commonly associated with hiatal hernias (HHs), which represents about 75 % of secondary GV cases. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are critical to prevent life-threatening complications. A 52-year-old female with a history of symptomatic HH presented with worsening retrosternal pain, heartburn, and early satiety. Imaging studies, including CT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, demonstrated a large Type III HH with entire intrathoracic migration of the stomach and secondary GV. Emergency laparoscopic repair with Nissen fundoplication was performed, resulting in successful resolution of the volvulus and an uneventful postoperative recovery. GV remains a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific symptoms, often overlap with both cardiac and other gastrointestinal diseases. In HH patients, GV should be suspected, particularly those with progressive symptoms. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis. Minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopic repair with fundoplication, are effective in addressing both the volvulus and underlying anatomical defects, offering reduced morbidity and faster recovery. This case highlights the value of prompt identification and surgical correction of GV in the setting of HH. Laparoscopic surgery performed in a timely manner can prevent critical complications and significantly enhance patient results."

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to determine the spectrum of diseases of surgical acute abdomen by ultrasonography and comparing the ultrasound diagnosis with the surgical diagnosis of acute abdominal conditions in a low-income resource setting. A prospective observational study was conducted on consecutive patients presenting with acute abdomen to the radiology department for abdominal ultrasonography. The ultrasound diagnosis was compared with the surgical diagnosis. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for association, and Kappa statistics was used for interobserver agreement. Diagnostic performance markers included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy. The most common conditions included appendicitis (27.5%), bowel perforation (21.7%), and ectopic pregnancy (12.5%). Ultrasonography had an overall sensitivity of 80.8%, specificity of 99.1%, PPV of 89.0%, NPV of 98.3%, and diagnostic accuracy of 97.6%. Sensitivities of 69.7%, 88.5%, 100.0%, and specificities of 98.9%, 96.8%, 100.0% were seen for acute appendicitis, bowel perforation, and ectopic pregnancy, respectively. There was a significant relationship between ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of most of the acute abdominal conditions (P < 0.001) except for appendiceal abscess (P = 0.05). Ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of all the acute abdominal conditions showed beyond chance kappa (κ) interobserver agreement (0.20< κ ≤1.00). With skilled hands, there is high concordance between ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of acute abdomen. Ultrasonography should be part of the initial evaluation of patients with surgical acute abdomen in a setting where emergency abdominal computed tomography is not readily available, accessible, and affordable. Résumé Introduction:L’objectif de cette étude était de déterminer le spectre des pathologies de l’abdomen aigu chirurgical par échographie et de comparer le diagnostic échographique au diagnostic chirurgical des affections abdominales aiguës dans un contexte de ressources à faibles revenus.Matériel et méthodes:Une étude observationnelle prospective a été menée auprès de patients consécutifs se présentant au service de radiologie pour une échographie abdominale pour un abdomen aigu. Le diagnostic échographique a été comparé au diagnostic chirurgical. Les tests du Chi carré et exact de Fisher ont été utilisés pour la corrélation, et la statistique Kappa pour la concordance interobservateur. Les marqueurs de performance diagnostique comprenaient la sensibilité, la spécificité, la valeur prédictive positive (VPP), la valeur prédictive négative (VPN) et la précision diagnostique.Résultats:Les affections les plus fréquentes étaient l’appendicite (27,5 %), la perforation intestinale (21,7 %) et la grossesse extra-utérine (12,5 %). L’échographie avait une sensibilité globale de 80,8 %, une spécificité de 99,1 %, une VPP de 89 %, une VPN de 98,3 % et une précision diagnostique de 97,6 %. Des sensibilités de 69,7 %, 88,5 %, 100 %, et des spécificités de 98,9 %, 96,8 %, 100 %, ont été observées respectivement pour l’appendicite aiguë, la perforation intestinale et la grossesse extra-utérine. Il existait une corrélation significative entre l’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical pour la plupart des affections abdominales aiguës (P < 0,001), à l’exception de l’abcès appendiculaire (P = 0,05). L’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical de toutes les affections abdominales aiguës ont montré une concordance interobservateur kappa (κ) au-delà du hasard (0,20 < κ ≤ 1,00).Conclusion:Avec des mains expertes, il existe une forte concordance entre l’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical de l’abdomen aigu.

    "abstract": "Background: Acute appendicitis (AA) is a common surgical emergency worldwide. Over the past few decades, diagnostic imaging has become a cornerstone in the identification of acute appendicitis, significantly contributing to the reduction in unnecessary laparotomies and associated healthcare costs. This study aimed to investigate the influence of serum and spot urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, as well as other established clinical and biochemical parameters on the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Methods: This prospective study was conducted between January and November 2023, evaluating 97 patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Serum and spot urine 5-HIAA levels, level of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Alvarado score were analyzed. Patients were further allocated to subgroups based on their Alvarado scores, the onset time of the symptoms, and pathological findings to statistically assess the relationship between the parameters. Results: The mean age of the patients was 34.6 ± 14.8 years. Of the patients, 57 (58.8%) were male, and 40 (41.2%) were female. Spot urine 5-HIAA levels exhibited statistically significant variation among different symptom onset time groups, with elevated levels observed in patients presenting within the first 12 h of symptom onset (p < 0.001). Neutrophil counts were significantly different among Alvarado score groups (p < 0.001), whereas CRP levels significantly increased with the onset time of the symptoms (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Increased spot urine 5-HIAA is supportive of the diagnosis of AA in patients presenting within the first 12 h of symptom onset. Hematological parameters, especially CRP, may provide more reliable information regarding disease severity and progression."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Perforated peptic ulcers are a common surgical emergency and rank among the leading causes of acute peritonitis worldwide. Previous studies have suggested a seasonal pattern in the occurrence of symptomatic perforated peptic ulcers. With the advancement of modern medicine, including the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors, and the effects of climate change, this study aimed to assess potential seasonal variations in the incidence of peptic ulcer perforation in our region. Methods: This retrospective analysis included 104 adult patients (mean age: 61.5 ± 14.7 years) who underwent surgical treatment for peptic ulcer perforation between January 2021 and April 2024. Patients were analyzed by gender, age, risk factors (smoking and alcohol consumption), the location of the perforation (gastric or duodenal), and discharge outcome (survived or deceased). Additionally, cases were categorized by the month and season of the ulcer perforation. Results: Among the 104 patients (mean age 61.5 ± 14.7 years), 68 (65.4%) were male. Gastric and duodenal perforations were nearly equally observed (51% vs. 49%). A statistically significant difference in overall perforation rates by gender was observed (p = 0.009), though not between ulcer sites (p = 0.628 and p = 0.739). The highest number of perforations occurred in July (n = 12), while the lowest occurred in November (n = 4); however, no significant variation was found by month (p = 0.916) or season (p = 0.891), despite a predominance in spring. Comorbidities were present in 60% of patients. Smoking (33.6%) and alcohol use (22.1%) were common. Alcohol abuse was noted in 22.1% of patients and was significantly associated with both gastric (p < 0.001) and duodenal (p < 0.001) perforations, though not with the overall incidence (p = 0.284). Smoking, reported in 33.6% of patients, showed no significant association with the perforation site or overall incidence (p = 0.946). The combination of smoking and alcohol use favored gastric perforations, but without statistical significance (p = 0.157). Conclusions: Alcohol consumption appeared to increase the risk of ulcer perforation, while smoking did not demonstrate a statistically significant association. Although spring exhibited the highest observed incidence of peptic ulcer perforation, seasonal variation did not show a statistically significant difference overall."

    "abstract": "Acute intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency, usually caused by adhesions, tumors, or hernias. Bezoars are a rare but significant cause of small bowel obstruction (SBO), even in patients without prior gastrointestinal surgery. We report a case of a 60-year-old man with no surgical history who presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and absence of bowel movements. Imaging suggested SBO, and diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed a meat bezoar obstructing the terminal ileum. Histopathological examination revealed thermally altered liver parenchyma, consistent with undigested cooked meat. The bezoar was successfully removed surgically, and the patient recovered without complications. This case underscores the importance of considering bezoars, including rare forms like meat bezoars, in the differential diagnosis of SBO, particularly in patients with nonspecific symptoms. Early recognition and surgical intervention are vital to avoid serious complications such as perforation or ischemia."

To determine the relationship between the mechanism of injury and the patterns of fractures on the plain radiographs of adults with femoral shaft fractures. A cross-sectional study of 390 adults with 402 femoral shaft fractures at three tertiary hospitals' Surgical Emergency and Orthopedics units was carried out over one year using plain radiographs. The demographics, fracture etiology, fracture site, and associated injuries were evaluated. Data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 23.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). The mean age was 40.93 (SD=16.3) years. Road traffic accidents (82.8%) were the commonest etiology, while mid-shaft fracture (52.2%) and comminuted fractures (36.3%) were the most common fracture sites and fracture patterns, respectively. Soft tissue injuries were commonly associated. Road traffic accident was the most common cause of femoral shaft fracture. The pattern of femoral fractures varied with age and the etiology of injury. Reducing road traffic accidents is key to decreasing femoral shaft fractures worldwide. The prompt assessment of femoral shaft fracture will enhance its effective management, reducing mortality and morbidity in affected individuals."

Mortality is influenced by several factors, such as aetiology, defect location, comorbidities, age, and delays in treatment. This study reviews patients with OP undergoing surgery, analysing mortality risks and the impact of timing on surgical outcomes. Methods: Medical records of 45 patients surgically treated for OP across three tertiary centers were analysed. Results: Of the 45 patients, 31 were male (68.88%) and 14 were female (31.11%), with a mean age of 66.00 ± 17.75 years. Pre-operative CT was performed in all patients, and 18 (40%) underwent oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. As many as 25 patients (55.55%) presented within 24 h, 10 (22.22%) within 24-72 h, and 10 (22.22%) after 72 h. Symptoms included pain, vomiting, fever, dysphagia, and subcutaneous emphysema. Foreign body ingestion and Boerhaave's syndrome were the leading causes (33.33% each), followed by caustic ingestion (17.77%) and iatrogenic and traumatic cases. Treatments included primary repair, debridement, oesophagectomy, and oesophagogastrectomy. Primary repair was performed in 22 cases (48.88%), and muscle flaps reinforced 11 of these. Direct repair showed the highest success rate when performed within 24 h. Thirty patients (66.66%) experienced complications, including respiratory failure, oesophagopleural fistula, and sub-stenosis. The hospital stay average was 36.34 ± 35.03 days. Nine patients underwent same-session/two-stage gastroplasty or retrosternal coloplasty for reconstruction, with complications including stenosis and leaks. Six patients (13.33%) died within the first 24 h after surgery, primarily due to severe comorbidities (three (50%) were octogenarians). Conclusions: OP is a life-threatening condition with high mortality. Primary repair is the preferred treatment. Oesophagectomy and gastrectomy are reserved for extensive lesions. Muscle flaps can reinforce sutures in cervical and thoracic perforations. Mortality is mainly influenced by the severity of the patient's clinical picture and comorbidities, rather than by time and type of treatment."

    "abstract": "A 62-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department of the General Hospital of Katerini, Greece, complaining of abdominal pain, fever, and general discomfort. Laboratory tests indicated an elevated white blood cell count and an elevated C-reactive protein level. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed dilated small bowel loops and free intraperitoneal fluid. During laparotomy, extensive ischemia and necrosis of both the small and large bowel were discovered, and a resection of the small bowel and the right colon was performed, leaving the patient with only 90 cm of small intestine and a jejunocolic anastomosis. Postoperative management was particularly challenging, requiring a multidisciplinary approach, an intensive care unit stay, reoperations due to anastomotic leaks, continuous parenteral nutrition and electrolyte management, and aggressive antibiotic treatment for persistent bacterial infections. This case report highlights the importance of appropriate management of this life-threatening complication following extensive bowel resection."

    "abstract": "Spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a rare surgical emergency of the spine that can result in permanent neurological injury if not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. Because early presentation can appear similar to benign back or neck pain, delays in diagnosis may be relatively common. We sought an improved understanding of the characteristics associated with SEA and frequency of delays in SEA diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients with new magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed SEA from January 1, 2016-December 31, 2019 in an integrated healthcare system. We applied electronic data abstraction and focused manual chart review to describe potentially SEA-related ambulatory and emergency visits in the 30 days prior to SEA diagnosis, and patient characteristics including comorbidities, potential risk factors, and presenting signs and symptoms. We described the frequency of potential delays in diagnosis and of previously described clinical characteristics and risk factors for SEA. Spinal epidural abscess was diagnosed in 457 patients during the study period, 178 (39%) of whom were female, with median age 63 years (interquartile range 45-81 years). More than two-thirds of patients had at least one visit prior to diagnosis (323, 71%), and SEA location was most commonly the lumbar spine (235, 51%). Although over 90% of patients presented with back or neck pain or tenderness, the classic triad of back pain, fever, and neurologic symptoms was present in only 10% of patients. Diabetes mellitus and infection in the prior 90 days were common, while injection drug use, chronic steroid use, HIV infection, and solid organ transplant were rare. In an integrated healthcare system, 71% of patients with spinal epidural abscess had potentially related ambulatory care or emergency visits in the 30 days prior to diagnosis. Diagnosis of SEA remains challenging, with multiple visits common before the diagnosis is clear."

    "abstract": "Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is a surgical emergency and life-threatening complication affecting 2-10% of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) patients. Delayed diagnosis and surgical management are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study assessed the magnitude and outcome of PUP among patients operated on at two public hospitals in Jigjig town, Ethiopia. A 3-year hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 130 patients operated for PUP at the study hospitals in Jigjig from April 1st, 2018, to July 30th, 2021. Data were collected from medical records. Bivariate analysis identified key factors impacting outcomes in PUP patients. The cohort had a male-to-female ratio of 8.7:1, and a mean age of 38 ± 13.3 years, with 48.8% smokers and 56.6% chat chewers. Duodenal perforations accounted for 93.7% of cases, with post-operative complications in 29.1% and an in-hospital mortality rate of 5.5%. Significant predictors of morbidity and mortality included advanced age (AOR 23.88), comorbidities (AOR 26.80), pre-operative hypotension (AOR 32.33), and delayed hospital presentation (AOR 30.10). Male predominance, younger age, high smoking and chat chewing rates, and primarily duodenal perforations are common in perforated peptic ulcer cases. Advanced age, comorbidities, pre-operative hypotension, and delayed hospital presentation significantly increase postoperative complications and mortality, emphasizing the need for timely intervention and targeted public health measures to improve patient outcomes. Early intervention and careful management of comorbidities are crucial to improve survival and reduce complications in patients with PUP."

    "abstract": "Introduction Bowel perforation is a common emergency with high morbidity and mortality. The patient presented with acute abdomen, abdominal distention, obstipation, and frequent gas under the diaphragm on radiogram. Arterial blood gas (ABG) is one of the earliest investigations done in cases of suspected bowel perforation in the Emergency Room (ER), and includes serum lactate.  Objective This study evaluates the role of sequential monitoring of serum lactate levels while ensuring a consistent timing of measurements and finding associations with prolonged hospital stay, surgical site occurrence, anastomotic leak, and mortality outcomes. Methods The study included 72 patients who presented to the healthcare facility within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms or occurrence. Continuous ABG was done before surgery and at POD 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and various parameters like age, sex, comorbidities, duration of presentation, site of perforation, prolonged hospital stay, surgical site occurrence, anastomotic leak, and mortality were noted in the form of tables. Results Analysis revealed that the mean serum lactate levels were generally higher in patients with prolonged hospital stays as compared to those without; however, there was no statistical significance at any time point. For surgical site occurrences (SSOs), there was no statistically significant difference in lactate levels between the two groups at Pre-Op, POD1, and POD2; however, significant differences were observed since POD3. For anastomotic leak, significant differences were observed at POD2. And for mortality, preoperatively, the mean lactate level in the mortality group was 5.91 mmol/L and 2.74 mmol/L in the non-mortality group, and this was statistically significant in all time periods. Conclusion Elevated serum lactate levels were consistently associated with adverse postoperative outcomes, including prolonged hospital stay, SSOs, anastomotic leaks, and mortality, with significance observed particularly from POD2 onward. Although not all differences were statistically significant, the trends suggest a meaningful clinical correlation. Routine lactate monitoring may serve as an important tool for the early detection of complications and risk stratification."

Perforation of the strangulated bowel loop inside the inguinal canal due to delayed presentation is known, but the occurrence of intraperitoneal proximal bowel perforation is exceedingly rare. This poses a unique challenge in terms of the surgical incision required and the type of hernia repair to be done. This case report describes a 44-year-old male who presented with a strangulated right inguinal hernia along with peritonitis. A midline exploratory laparotomy revealed two perforations in the proximal ileum, which were sutured primarily. The entire bowel was checked for any obvious gross pathology. The bowel wall did not appear inflamed, thickened, or constricted at any point. The strangulated bowel in the inguinal canal was viable and was reduced successfully, and the hernia was repaired through a separate inguinal incision using the nylon Darning technique. The patient had a full recovery with no recurrence at six-month follow-up."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction (IO) is a common surgical emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in critically ill ICU patients. The Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), calculated using serum albumin levels and total lymphocyte counts, has demonstrated prognostic value in various conditions. However, its role in critically ill IO patients remains unexplored. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the MIMIC-IV database. Critically ill patients with IO were identified, and their PNI values on the first day of ICU admission were recorded. Patients were stratified into quartiles based on PNI and analyzed for 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day all-cause mortality. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders, and restricted cubic splines examined the relationship between PNI and mortality risk. A total of 701 patients were included in the analysis. Patients in the highest PNI quartile had significantly lower 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day all-cause mortality rates compared to those in the lowest quartile. After adjusting for covariates, higher PNI remained an independent predictor of reduced mortality (30-day HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.98, p < 0.001; 60-day HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98, p < 0.001; 90-day HR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99, p = 0.002). PNI is independently associated with lower mortality in critically ill IO patients, supporting its utility as a risk stratification tool in this population. These findings underscore the importance of early nutritional assessment and intervention, and highlight PNI's potential to guide clinical decision-making in the ICU setting."

    "abstract": "Nurses' knowledge of emergency care is a vital component of emergency capabilities. We sought to evaluate the factors that influence the knowledge on trauma and emergency care of nurses in district hospitals in Ghana. In this cross-sectional study, we administered a questionnaire on emergency care to 406 nurses working in 11 (out of 37) randomly-selected district hospitals in the Ashanti Region. This included 10 multiple-choice questions on trauma care and 10 on general medical/surgical emergency care to objectively assess knowledge on emergency care. Analysis involved descriptive statistics, inferential tests comparing tests scores with Student's t-tests and ANOVA, and multivariable linear regression. Mean overall test score for knowledge was 60.1 % correct (SD 13.7 %). Results were tightly clustered with an inter-quartile range of 50 % to 70 %. Factors influencing the test scores on multivariable linear regression included: (a) gender (male nurses scored an adjusted 3.8 % higher than female nurses, p = 0.015; beta=3.8; 95 %CI 0.7-6.8); and (b) refresher training (nurses who had received refresher training on emergency care scored an adjusted 3.3 % higher than those who had not received such training, p = 0.018; beta=3.3; CI 0.6-6.0). The higher overall scores for male nurses were due solely to higher scores on trauma-related questions. Male nurses scored an average of an adjusted 5.1 % higher on the trauma questions (p = 0.023; beta=5.1; CI 0.7-9.5) than female nurses, but their scores on general emergency care were not significantly different. Test scores for knowledge on emergency care for nurses working in Ghanaian district hospitals were generally adequate. While gender did influence test scores, the main actionable factor associated with higher test scores was having received refresher training in emergency care. There is a need for greater availability of such continuing professional development for nurses."

Although initially stable, he rapidly deteriorated despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, with systolic blood pressure and haemoglobin measuring at 66 mm Hg and 86 g/L at their lowest, respectively. This prompted the initiation of the massive transfusion protocol due to haemorrhagic shock. The patient was urgently transferred to theatres and on surgical exploration, active bleeding from the left upper quadrant necessitated splenectomy. He recovered well postoperatively and was discharged with the appropriate prophylaxis. This case demonstrates the importance of considering atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) in acute abdominal pain, as its vague presentation often leads to failed diagnoses. Patients require prompt stabilisation and surgical intervention. Vaccinations and lifelong prophylactic antibiotics are recommended to prevent postsplenectomy infections."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a surgical emergency requiring prompt revascularization with resection of unsalvageable bowel. Despite successful revascularization, ongoing organ damage can persist from ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and there is a need for adjunct therapies to ameliorate this ongoing insult. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 36) were divided into five groups: control, heparin (HEP), HEP + verapamil (VER), HEP + valproic acid (VPA), HEP+VER+VPA. The animals were subjected to 45 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Upon reperfusion, therapies were administered. Plasma samples were collected before occlusion and at end-of-study for intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The full length of the small intestine was collected, stained with H&E and scored according to the Park/Chiu score for intestinal ischemia damage. Twenty-three of 36 rats survived 4 h of reperfusion and there was no difference in survival between the groups. I-FABP levels was significantly lower in HEP+VER vs. control (3.8 ± 1.5 vs. 6.18 ± 1.0ng/ml; p = 0.0040). IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha showed the lowest mean values in the HEP+VER group compared to all groups. The histological analysis revealed the lowest score of intestinal damage in the HEP+VER group, however, the difference to control was not significant. Administering heparin and verapamil at the time of revascularization may mitigate intestinal IRI without causing detrimental systemic effects. Further studies in large animal models and in the setting of local administration are needed to investigate the potential of this approach."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common abdominal surgical emergency and is a major cause of acute abdomen in more than 20% of cases. Although various studies have been conducted in recent years on topics such as surgical techniques and antibiotic treatment of appendicitis, today there is a lack of large-scale studies focused on the different severity levels of acute appendicitis and their management. The study aimed to analyze the severity, types of surgical techniques, and mortality associated with acute appendicitis to identify possible developments. We conducted a retrospective multicenter observational study based on routine data from 2010 to 2022. Patients over 18 years old with acute appendicitis were included and the following data were collected: patient demographics, comorbidities, type of surgery, complications, admission to ICU, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. A total of 31,988 patients were included in the study. At the end of the study, 97.0% (P < .001) of the patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, with 86% of cases involving closure of the appendix stump by stapler (P < .001). It was only from 2014 onwards that more than 90% of surgeries were performed laparoscopically, and from 2017, this figure rose to 95%. Complicated appendicitis was present in 27.4% of cases. The distribution of severity was as follows: unspecified acute appendicitis in 39.5%, appendicitis with local peritonitis in 33.1%, appendicitis with local peritonitis and perforation in 17.1%, appendicitis with peritoneal abscess in 5.4%, and appendicitis with generalized peritonitis in 4.9%. Women had a significantly lower risk for conversion to an open operation than men (P < .001). The highest morbidity was observed in the group that converted from laparoscopy to open surgery (P <.001). Non-surgical treatment of appendicitis was not relevant, accounting for only 4% of cases. Since 2017, primary laparoscopic appendectomy has been the gold standard for even complicated acute appendicitis (> 95% annually). Over three-quarters of patients undergo an appendectomy with a stapler, making this surgical technique the preferred method of laparoscopic surgery in Germany. Patients who undergo an interoperative switch to open therapy should be considered a subgroup at risk of increased mortality. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06558760."

This study aims to investigate the frequency and risk factors of mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing PPU surgery. In this cohort study, records of 102 patients, who underwent surgery for PPU between September 2020 and April 2023, were reviewed. All mortality and complications that occurred during the 6-mo period postoperatively were considered in the study. Then influencing factors were compared between groups with and without complications, and between deceased and alive. Among the 102 patients with an average age of 47.56 ± 17.36 y, 87.3% were male. Postoperative mortality and morbidity were 18.6% and 31.4%, respectively. Multivariant analysis showed that factors significantly associated with complications were age over 60, decreased albumin, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, comorbidities, preoperative shock, increased respiratory rate, decreased level of consciousness and contamination (P < 0.05). Moreover, elevated blood urea nitrogen, comorbidities, decreased level of consciousness and contamination were significantly associated with mortality (P < 0.05). Clinical assessment, timely intervention, and managing comorbidities could mitigate the mortality and morbidity risks associated with PPU surgery. The knowledge of mentioned risk factors would enable surgeons to prevent postoperative complications in patients with PPU."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a common pediatric emergency. Notably, the inadvertent ingestion of magnets is frequently initially asymptomatic, only to be detected days later when gastrointestinal damage has already manifested. We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 16 pediatric patients who underwent surgical removal of ingested magnets at our hospital between January 2018 and December 2023. This review encompassed the patients' demographic characteristics, the interval from ingestion to admission, clinical presentation, diagnostic techniques, the type and number of ingested magnets, location of injury, surgical interventions, and postoperative outcomes. The study sample comprised 11 boys and 5 girls, with a median age of 3.6 years (range, 1-14 years). The predominant presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (n = 6), abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting (n = 3), and a combination of fever, diarrhea, and seizure (n = 1); 6 patients were asymptomatic. Neodymium bead magnets were the most commonly ingested type, noted in 13 patients. All 16 patients underwent either laparoscopic exploration or laparotomy due to clinical deterioration or confirmed complications. For 13 patients, magnet removal with primary bowel repair was performed, whereas in 3 patients, magnet removal combined with segmental resection and primary bowel repair was necessary. Fifteen of the 16 patients recovered without complications; however, wound infections occurred in 2 patients, and 1 patient required adhesiolysis and segmental resection of the jejunum due to intestinal obstruction. One patient died of septic shock. The 15 surviving patients are currently in excellent condition. Magnet ingestion by children, particularly when multiple magnets are involved, constitutes a surgical emergency. Timely identification and prompt surgical intervention are critical to preventing severe complications. Improved educational and preventive strategies (including public awareness initiatives regarding the hazards of small magnets) are essential to reducing the frequency of these incidents."

An accurate diagnosis is even more crucial when AAP is associated with left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain, which has a wide variety of differential diagnoses from self-limiting to life-threatening diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacies of physical examination (PE), plain abdominal radiography (PAR), and ultrasonography (US) compared to the computed tomography (CT) scan in patients with nontraumatic LLQ AAP coming into the emergency department. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was performed on 220 patients with LLQ-AAP for > 2 h and < 5 days who underwent PAR, US, and CT after PE. An expert surgeon assigned a final diagnosis. Test characteristics, including diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative PV (NPV), were calculated for PE, PAR, and US, using a CT scan as the gold standard. Results: Among 220 patients (mean age of 48.17; 55.5% female), PE, PAR, and US yielded an overall accuracy of 30.91%, 35.91%, 50.91%, sensitivity of 75.47%, 62.26%, 39.62%, specificity of 16.77%, 27.54%, 54.49%, PPV of 22.35%, 21.43%, 21.65%, and NPV of 68.29%, 69.70%, and 73.98%, respectively. Conclusions: As a result of the highest sensitivity for PE and the highest accuracy for the US, we suggest considering PE as the primary investigation for identifying urgent conditions in patients with LLQ AAP and the US for an accurate diagnosis rather than PAR."

Our primary concerns were a possible periprocedural AA rupture becoming a surgical emergency, difficult vascular access, and perioperative thromboembolism. Periprocedural hemodynamic surges were avoided using continuous hemodynamic monitoring, adequate anesthetic depth, and analgesia. After an uneventful procedure, the patient was extubated with a smooth postoperative course.

This case involves a 71-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complete large bowel obstruction secondary to a sigmoid mass, raising concern for malignancy. Initial plans were made for decompression and colonoscopy. However, the patient left the hospital against medical advice and subsequently returned two days later with massive abdominal distension and peritonitis. Emergent exploratory celiotomy revealed a septic abdomen with gross contamination due to perforation in the ascending colon near the hepatic flexure, which was not amenable to repair. At a minimum, a subtotal colectomy was required. The patient underwent a single-stage oncologic subtotal colectomy with a hand-sewn ileosigmoid anastomosis and fascial closure. Pathologic evaluation confirmed stage IIb invasive sigmoid adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 0/43 lymph nodes. The patient was discharged on postoperative day nine without complications. For patients presenting with abdominal sepsis from fecal contamination caused by large bowel perforation due to sigmoid malignancy and obstruction, surgical management options vary widely. These range from damage control surgery with multiple subsequent procedures to single-stage resection and anastomosis. This case underscores the importance of individualized, careful decision-making both preoperatively and intraoperatively. It highlights the factors to consider when evaluating the feasibility of single-stage oncologic surgery and the risks associated with performing a primary anastomosis during emergent operations."

However, other conditions, such as hemorrhagic epididymal cyst rupture, can mimic its presentation, posing diagnostic challenges. A 25-year-old male presented with sudden, severe right scrotal pain. Examination revealed a tender superior epididymal mass. Scrotal ultrasound showed homogeneous fluid collection with normal testicular blood flow. Due to severe pain, surgical exploration ruled out torsion and confirmed a hemorrhagic epididymal cyst, which was excised intact. Distinguishing testicular torsion from hemorrhagic epididymal cyst rupture is crucial. Doppler ultrasound remains the primary diagnostic tool, with torsion showing absent blood flow, whereas cysts maintain normal or increased vascularization. In unclear cases, surgical exploration is justified to prevent testicular loss. Although testicular torsion is the most critical cause of acute scrotal pain, alternative diagnoses, such as hemorrhagic epididymal cyst rupture, should be considered. Prompt diagnosis using clinical evaluation and imaging can prevent unnecessary orchiectomy, with surgical exploration remaining the safest option in uncertain cases."

It occurs in approximately 5%-15% of women with endometriosis. Although it rarely leads to obstruction or perforation, there is no clear consensus on its optimal management. Hormonal therapy is considered the first-line treatment for endometriosis; however, the best approach for intestinal involvement remains controversial. This study aims to contribute to the literature by evaluating patients with intestinal endometriosis who underwent surgery for acute abdomen. Sixteen patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute abdomen at the Emergency General Surgery Clinic of İstanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty of Medicine, between February 2016 and April 2023 were identified. Four patients voluntarily withdrew from the study, and 12 were included in the analysis. Demographic data, laboratory findings, surgical records, length of hospital stay, pathology reports, postoperative complications within the first 30 days, and their management were reviewed. Patients' current health status was assessed through telephone interviews. The mean age of the patients was 39.3+-9.2 years. Nine patients underwent surgery with a preoperative diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, while three were operated on for suspected acute appendicitis. Among the patients with intestinal obstruction, three underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection, and three had segmental small bowel resection. One patient underwent anterior resection with appendectomy, and another underwent both anterior resection and ileocecal resection with ileocolostomy. One patient underwent a left hemicolectomy. The mean hospital stay was 7.9+-5.9 days. Postoperative complications occurred in three patients (25%). The mean age of patients who experienced complications was significantly higher than that of those who did not (p<0.007). Histopathological examination revealed benign full-thickness endometriosis in all cases. The mean follow-up period was 50.6 months, with no recurrences observed. Acute abdomen due to intestinal endometriosis-related obstruction is extremely rare. In reproductive-aged women presenting with acute abdomen, intestinal endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In cases of clinical suspicion, intraoperative consultation with a gynecologist is recommended, and a multidisciplinary approach should be adopted to optimize treatment planning."

    "abstract": "Diverticulitis is a common complication of colonic diverticulosis and can lead to a range of serious issues, including perforation. Incisional hernias, often resulting from previous abdominal surgeries, usually contain omentum or bowel loops. However, it's uncommon for both conditions to present together, especially in the same anatomical location. We report a rare case of a 64-year-old male who presented with sudden abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Examination revealed a painful, erythematous para-umbilical hernia. CT imaging showed an incisional hernia containing a perforated segment of sigmoid colon with diverticulitis. The patient underwent emergency surgery with sigmoid resection, primary anastomosis, and hernia repair. His recovery was smooth, and he was discharged in good condition."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen after section cesarean (SC) is a case that can occur, and the diagnosis of the cause is very challenging. This case report describes the immediate diagnostic and management of unspecified abdominal pain on Day 13th post-SC, accompanied by complications. A 30-year-old woman with a history of SC on the 13th day came to the Emergency Room (ER) with abdominal pain and decreased consciousness. Focused Assisted Sonography in Trauma (FAST) and Kidney Ureter Bladder (KUB) X-ray as a diagnostic tool was performed, followed by laparotomy as definitive management. We found a 7 cm bladder rupture in the bladder dome, 8 L of urine mixed with pus, and 300 cc of blood clots. We manually evacuated the urine and blood clots and refreshed the bladder tissue and cystostomy, and then the bladder was sutured. Double antibiotics were given for Staphylococcus hemolyticus infection. The diagnosis of abdominal pain was challenging. Late diagnosis can cause complications and mortality. FAST and KUB X-rays are useful tools in the care of bladder rupture after SC. Laparotomy is an option for treatment. In this case, the patient underwent laparotomy followed by cystostomy. The role of double antibiotics is necessary in cases of sepsis. Patients with unspecified abdominal pain after SC need immediate diagnosis. Diagnosis with FAST is sufficient to be done in unstable patient conditions. Immediate management with Laparotomy and Cystostomy combined with antibiotics can minimize mortality."

    "abstract": "Appendiceal diverticulitis is a rare and often underdiagnosed condition that poses significant diagnostic challenges due to its atypical clinical presentation and similarity to acute appendicitis. We describe the case of a 37-year-old female patient who presented with acute abdominal pain and was ultimately diagnosed with appendicitis through computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent a successful laparoscopic appendectomy. This case underscores the diagnostic complexity of appendiceal diverticulitis, which is frequently mistaken for other causes of acute abdomen. The condition may be congenital or acquired, with differing pathophysiological mechanisms and histological features. Given the risk of complications such as perforation or neoplasia, prophylactic appendectomy is recommended even in cases of non-inflamed diverticula. Histopathological examination remains essential for definitive diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of heightened clinical suspicion and individualized surgical management in improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is a rare but serious condition in pregnancy, posing significant risks to both maternal and fetal health. Its diagnosis and management are particularly challenging due to non-specific symptoms, limitations in radiological assessment during pregnancy, and the potential for surgical complications. The differentiation between obstetric and non-obstetric causes of an acute abdomen also poses a diagnostic challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports one of the rarest cases of intestinal obstruction in the first trimester of pregnancy. The case was initially mistaken for an ectopic pregnancy. The condition was successfully managed surgically without the need for pregnancy termination. A 34-year-old G3P2L2 woman from Northern Tanzania presented at 12 weeks gestation with sudden-onset abdominal pain. Initial radiological findings suggested a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with extensive hemoperitoneum. The patient was taken for an emergency laparotomy where an intrauterine pregnancy was identified as well as gangrenous small bowel and sigmoid colon due to a 360-degree mesenteric rotation. Surgical intervention included bowel resection, decompression, and anastomosis of the remaining segments. The mesenteric defects were closed, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery, being discharged in stable condition for conservative management. This case report highlights the rarity of intestinal obstruction during pregnancy and the diagnostic challenges it presents. Our case is particularly unique due to the absence of previous abdominal surgery and presentation so early in gestation. There exists significant diagnostic uncertainty and resulting delays in treatment have the potential to increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity, especially in resource poor settings. Intestinal obstruction during pregnancy is an uncommon but serious condition associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity. Its diagnosis can be challenging, as symptoms may mimic common obstetric complications, leading to potential delays in recognition and treatment. Effective management requires a multidisciplinary approach and timely clinical decision-making to optimize outcomes for both the mother and fetus."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND. The reported diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US) for midgut malrotation and volvulus varies. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US for midgut malrotation and volvulus separately and to assess individual sonographic signs for each diagnosis. METHODS. This multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study included children (who were defined as individuals 0-18 years old) who had US performed as the first imaging test for evaluation of suspected midgut malrotation or volvulus from January 1, 2018, to June 30, 2021. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. Blinded reviewers measured the proximal duodenum and assessed for malrotation and volvulus as well as for specific sonographic signs. Nondiagnostic and equivocal studies were excluded. The reference standards used for malrotation included surgery, upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series, and CT and/or MRI. Volvulus reference standards included the same plus clinical follow-up (minimum, 28 days). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated to evaluate diagnostic performance; the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare median values. RESULTS. Malrotation analysis included 384 examinations; median patient age was 32 days (IQR, 5-182 days). Volvulus analysis included 900 examinations; median patient age was 60 days (IQR, 9-573 days). The sensitivity and specificity of US for malrotation were 93% (95% CI, 81-98%) and 96% (95% CI, 92-98%) by original report and 97% (95% CI, 87-100%) and 99% (95% CI, 97-100%) by blinded research review. The sensitivity and specificity of US for volvulus were 97% (95% CI, 85-100%) and 98% (95% CI, 96-99%) by original report and 97% (95% CI, 86-100%) and 99% (95% CI, 98-100%) by blinded research review. The most accurate sonographic signs were the intraperitoneal position of the third portion of the duodenum for malrotation (accuracy = 98%) and the whirlpool sign for volvulus (accuracy = 99%). The median proximal duodenal diameter was greater in children with volvulus (13 mm [IQR, 7-18 mm] versus 6 mm [IQR, 4-8 mm], p < .001). CONCLUSION. The performance of US for diagnosing both midgut malrotation and volvulus is excellent in the setting of a diagnostic imaging study. CLINICAL IMPACT. US can be used as the first-line imaging modality for diagnosing midgut malrotation and volvulus, with UGI series reserved for nondiagnostic or equivocal examinations."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the leading non-obstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy. Its diagnosis is complicated by pregnancy-related anatomical changes and poses significant risks for maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. This report describes a rare case of perforated appendicitis with deciduosis and free air under the diaphragm during pregnancy. A 28-year-old woman presented with severe right lower and middle abdominal pain and signs of inflammation at 31 weeks of gestation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed free air under the right diaphragm with no evidence of acute perforated appendicitis or peri-appendiceal free air. Suspecting idiopathic gastrointestinal perforation, exploratory surgery was planned following an emergency cesarean section. Exploratory surgery revealed perforated appendicitis with an abscess. Histological examination revealed deciduosis of the appendicitis with a perforation. If appendicitis cannot be identified on imaging during pregnancy and free air is present under the diaphragm, it is necessary to consider the possibility of perforated appendicitis with deciduosis, in addition to idiopathic intestinal perforation."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide. Researchers from various countries have evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its diagnosis and treatment, as well as a possible change in its management, such as outpatient treatment. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of acute appendicitis treated during the COVID-19 State of Emergency (SOE) and to assess whether it could be included in an ambulatory surgery program. Retrospective observational study involving patients treated at public hospitals for appendix diseases (K35-K38). We collected sociodemographic and clinical data. The influence of the lockdown on each variable was evaluated with a multivariate analysis. 201 patients were included. The SOE period group comprised 78 patients, and the pre-SOE period (control) included 123 patients who met the same inclusion criteria. The risk of complicated acute appendicitis increased by 1.015 times with age (p = 0.000). The longer surgery time was associated with a 7.265 times higher risk of postsurgical complications (p = 0.000). No differences were observed with respect to drain placement (p = 0.281), although the percentage was higher in 2020 (13.9% vs 19.7%). The length of hospital stay decreased significantly during the lockdown (p = 0.017). The lockdown did not influence the outcome of complicated acute appendicitis from the standpoint of morbidity and mortality, reducing the hospital stay, facilitating the path towards outpatient treatment."

In this report, the authors describe an unusual case of a patient presenting with chest pain and presyncopal symptoms after cardiac surgery who ultimately received a diagnosis of LA dissection and associated complete heart block. Although permanent pacemaker placement was required as a result of recurrent episodes of complete heart block, the patient was otherwise managed safely using a conservative approach without surgical reintervention. LA dissection is a surgical complication most commonly identified following mitral valve intervention, and it may be associated with debridement of calcium along the mitral annulus. Urgent surgical repair is indicated when LA dissection results in hemodynamic instability, typically through obstruction of the left atrial outflow, obstruction of the left atrial inflow, or cardiac tamponade. Although complete heart block is not a previously reported downstream complication of LA dissection, aspects of the atrioventricular (AV) node, particularly the compact AV node, lie within the interatrial septum and could be damaged by dissection. LA dissection is a rare, but potentially serious, complication that most commonly arises following mitral valve surgery. Although the presence of hemodynamic instability renders LA dissection a surgical emergency, a conservative approach that avoids reintervention may otherwise be considered."

In this report, we present the case of a 34-year-old pregnant woman with acute appendicitis. The appendicitis was diagnosed based on her abdominal symptoms, but it was difficult to diagnose based on preoperative imaging studies. Pathological examination led to the diagnosis of appendiceal decidua. Acute appendicitis due to appendiceal decidua is extremely rare and has only been described in a few case reports. It is difficult to diagnose appendiceal decidua from imaging findings. When a pregnant woman is diagnosed with acute abdomen, clinicians should consider appendiceal decidua as one of the causes of acute appendicitis."

Due to its nonspecific clinical presentation, ISK is often misdiagnosed causing a delay of definitive treatment. The condition is most frequently reported in regions with high-fiber diets and anatomical predispositions, but remains a globally uncommon entity. Radiological imaging, particularly CT scans, plays a crucial role in preoperative diagnosis, with the whirl sign including sigmoid and ileum being a key diagnostic clue. However, most cases are only confirmed intraoperatively, and outcomes depend on the extent of bowel necrosis and the timeliness of surgical intervention. Mortality rates remain high, particularly in cases complicated by sepsis and multiorgan failure. We present the case of a 49-year-old male who developed acute abdominal pain, with CT imaging and laparotomy confirming an ileosigmoid knot, ultimately resulting in a fatal outcome."

PoCUS enables quick, real-time assessment of conditions such as gastrointestinal pathologies (e.g., appendicitis and diverticulitis) and gynecological issues (e.g., hemorrhagic ovarian cysts and torsions) without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. This narrative review aims to evaluate the specific ultrasound findings for each condition, thus underscoring PoCUS diagnostic accuracy and utility. PoCUS is a valuable tool in the clinical management of acute pelvic pain. PoCUS optimizes patient outcomes and streamlines therapeutic pathways in both emergency and routine clinical settings by facilitating timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

No previous studies examining Type-A AD in regional Australia have been done. The aim of this study is to describe acute Type-A AD within a regional population of Australia. The primary outcomes were incidence and mortality. The secondary outcomes were assessment of risk factors, challenges in diagnosis, and associated complications. A retrospective analysis was undertaken in the Hunter New England (HNE) health district of New South Wales (NSW) from 2010 to 2020. A total of 122 patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of Type-A AD were included in the study. The data was analysed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS). Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported, and statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05. The incidence of Type-A AD in the HNE was 1.27 per 100 000 and overall mortality was 14.5%. Five percent of patients identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. Combined risk factors of smoking and hypertension, postoperative CVA, and misdiagnosis demonstrated higher mortality which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This study is the first study to illustrate Type-A AD in regional Australia. The findings reported here present a solid foundation for future studies to better understand the challenges faced in the diagnosis and management of AD."

Delays in management can lead to permanent bowel and bladder incontinence, sexual dysfunction, lower limb paralysis and chronic pain.The Getting it Right First Time (GIRFT) National CES Pathway 2023 mandates that patients with red flag symptoms require an 'emergency MRI as soon as possible, certainly within 4 hours of request'. However, an audit at Medway Hospital (MH) showed that despite achieving this target, patients still experience delays from emergency department (ED) attendance (time of arrival) to MRI scan (median 5.9 hours).In response, MH launched a CES working group of orthopaedic surgeons, radiologists, emergency doctors and managers. Having identified time to MRI request as a major driver of delays, the team altered the GIRFT target to a SMART primary aim of 4 hours from ED presentation to MRI. Two key interventions were planned: (1) the translation of the GIRFT guidelines into a standard operating procedure (SOP), cotargeting a secondary outcome improvement of more accurately identifying those at risk of CES, thus reducing unnecessary MRIs for those that did not meet those guidelines and (2) the extension of MRI operational hours.The new SOP was implemented across three plan-do-study-act cycles, but MRI operational hours were not extended. The primary outcome of reduction in time from ED presentation to MRI was not achieved (5.9 to 5.7 hours). Secondary aim improvements include a reduction of unnecessary MRIs (38% to 18%), CES MRI scans/day (0.5/day to 0.4/day), time to analgesia (5.3 to 4.2 hours) and incorrect referrals to the General Practitioner-led Medway on Call Care service (9% to 0%).Suggestions for further improvements within district general hospitals include a 24-hour emergency MRI service and a standardised CES MRI request form."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency caused by inflammation and infection of the appendix, yet there is limited consensus on its management despite its widespread prevalence. While surgery remains the standard, the role of antibiotics, particularly in nonoperative management, is increasingly recognized. This study aims to identify the antibiotic regimens for appendicitis in three governmental and military hospitals in Taif City, assess their consistency with international guidelines, review effectiveness, and determine the length of hospital stay for patients following different treatment methods.  Method: A retrospective chart review design was used to analyze the antibiotics regimen used for managing appendicitis and perforated appendicitis among patients of various age groups in Taif City. Data was collected from the medical records of patients admitted to pediatric and adult surgery units from January 2020 to December 2022. SPSS software, version 26.0, was used for descriptive analysis, while inferential statistical tests were used to compare hospital stays.  Results: The study analyzed 646 hospital records for patients with appendicitis. Surgical interventions were common, with open appendectomy being the most common procedure, 522 (80.8%). Only 25 (3.9%) patients received preoperative antibiotics, while 481 (74.5%) patients received postoperative antibiotics, mostly Augmentin, with oral administration being preferred in 450 (69.7%) cases. Postoperative outcomes showed low complication rates, with only 54 (8.4%) experiencing surgical-site infections, hernia, and minimal abdominal pain. The mean hospital stay was 2.2 days.  Conclusion: The study suggests that compliance with preoperative antibiotic guidelines should be improved, and nonoperative management options should be discussed in certain patient populations. The focus should be on rational antibiotic usage and patient-oriented treatment methods to maximize appendicitis treatment compared to existing literature."

    "abstract": "Appendicular band syndrome is an extremely rare surgical emergency, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Although intestinal obstruction comprises 2 % - 8 % of the cases of acute abdomen presenting to emergency, obstruction due to appendicular band syndrome is a rare entity. A 43-year-old male presented with features suggestive of small bowel obstruction for 5 days. On examination, the abdomen was distended and tense with generalized mild tenderness all over the abdomen. CECT (abdomen and pelvis) showed a transition point in the distal ileum, with dilated bowel loops proximal to it. On exploratory laparotomy, the appendix was found completely encircling the distal ileum, forming a constricting band, for which release of appendicular band with appendectomy was done. The initiating event in appendicular band syndrome is acute appendicitis itself. Due to the inflammation of appendix, its tip gets adhered to the caecum, retro-peritoneum, ileal mesentery, or ileum itself, forming a potential gap. A segment of bowel may herniate through this gap and become entrapped, resulting in closed-loop obstruction and subsequent strangulation. In the absence of bowel strangulation, releasing the appendicular band along with appendectomy is sufficient. However, if the bowel loop is found to be gangrenous, resection with primary anastomosis is warranted. Appendicular band syndrome, often diagnosed intraoperatively, should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses when evaluating patients with features of bowel obstruction. Early diagnosis guides incision planning, while timely surgical intervention is crucial for preventing serious complications."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Endometriosis can present as ovarian endometriosis in 15-25% of the cases. While chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea dominate its clinical presentation, acute complications, such as spontaneous OMA rupture, are rare (<3%), often mimicking acute abdominal pain and necessitating emergency surgery. Diagnostic delays persist due to the condition's rarity and overlapping symptoms with ovarian torsion or appendicitis. This study investigates the clinical features of ruptured OMAs to enhance preoperative suspicion and optimize management. Methods: From February 2011 to August 2023, 14 patients with spontaneous rupture of histologically confirmed endometriomas underwent emergency laparoscopy for acute abdominal pain in the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. The clinical data of these patients were analyzed to find common patterns of spontaneous endometrioma ruptures. We also conducted a literature search in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Embase databases from inception to December 2023 in order to identify other possible confounding factors. The search was based on the keywords \"ruptured endometrioma\". All English full-text prospective and retrospective observational and interventional studies with at least five patients that described the clinical features and findings of women diagnosed with ruptured endometrioma and treated surgically were included. Results: The median age at operation was 37.4 (23-49) years old, and all cases presented with acute abdominal pain, with/without peritonitis. Only 3/14 patients presented with fever, while the most common laboratory finding was an elevated CRP level of 45.6 mg/L (3-100 mg/L), while leukocytosis was less pronounced, with a median of 12.2 G/L (6.04-21.4 G/L). Notably, 64.3% (9 out of 14) of the patients reported experiencing dysmenorrhea, while for the remaining 5 individuals, the presence or absence of dysmenorrhea could not be obtained. Interestingly, only one patient had undergone hormonal treatment, with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) of Ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg) and Desogestrel (0.15 mg), while the other patients either lacked awareness of their endometriosis or expressed reluctance towards hormonal downregulation therapy. The median endometrioma size was 7 cm (3.5-18 cm), and 78.57% of the cases (11 out of 14 patients) had only ovarian endometriosis, while only 3 patients had involvement of compartment A, B, or C according to the # ENZIAN classification. Conclusions: Though rare, spontaneous OMA rupture should be considered in acute abdomen cases, especially with cysts > 5 cm. Hormonal therapy may reduce rupture risk, but more research is needed to confirm this and refine diagnostic strategies."

    "title": "Patient and caregiver knowledge of pediatric testicular torsion: A scoping review.",
    "abstract": "Pediatric testicular torsion (PedTT) is a surgical emergency that requires prompt presentation. Delay in intervention can lead to testicular loss. In the PedTT care pathway, the pre-hospital phase prior to presenting to the emergency department, is the strongest determining factor for testicular salvage. Although the severe nature of testicular pain is likely to prompt many families to seek emergent care, patients with milder symptoms may delay presentation if they and their caregivers are unaware of PedTT as a disease entity. Understanding caregiver and pediatric knowledge of PedTT will aid in better designing and delivering educational initiatives to reduce pre-hospital delay and improve testicular salvage. This study is a comprehensive scoping review of the literature reporting on pediatric and caregiver knowledge of PedTT, and outcomes of educational initiatives. A scoping review was performed on all English-language literature reporting on pediatric and caregiver knowledge of PedTT, as well as PedTT-based educational initiatives. Both qualitative and quantitative studies were reviewed, analyzed, and compiled. A total of 2773 articles were identified, with 21 studies included. After review, 11 studies focused on caregiver perspectives of PedTT, 5 studies examined patient perspectives, and 8 studies identified PedTT educational initiatives, with overlap between publications. Overall, knowledge gaps were identified in the definition of PedTT, presenting symptoms, and critical time frame for salvage by both pediatric and caregiver groups. Caregivers expressed a need and a desire for increased public awareness and teaching around PedTT. School-based educational initiatives were well-received among participants, with social media-based initiatives showing promise. Both pediatric and caregiver knowledge of PedTT is low, and lack of awareness may contribute to delayed presentation. Educational initiatives have been shown to improve PedTT knowledge and awareness. Results from this study can be used to optimize PedTT educational efforts to improve caregiver and public knowledge."

    "abstract": "Non-urgent visits to surgical emergency rooms (SERs) are an unnecessary burden on emergency health services, especially in low-resource settings. The aim of this study was to quantify the burden and determine predictors of non-urgent surgical ER visits in a tertiary care setting. This is a prospective analysis of the non-urgent visits in our SER over a 15-day period. We included patients of all ages and genders who presented to the SER at the time of data collection. Patients were excluded if they were detained, dead on arrival, or refused to consent. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the surgical urgency: group U (urgent) and group NU (non-urgent), and compared for the baseline characteristics, comorbid conditions, and referral route. Multivariable analyses were used to identify the independent predictors of these non-urgent presentations while controlling for potential confounders. Non-urgent visits accounted for 147 (35%) of all visits and were associated with younger age, female sex, rural residence, low income, and limited education (p<0.001). Most non-urgent cases were triage-referred (110 (74.8%), p=0.012). Diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity were more common in urgent cases (p<0.05). Independent predictors of non-urgent visits included female sex (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.50, 95% CI (1.10 - 2.05), p = 0.020), rural residence (aOR: 1.30, 95% CI (1.02 - 1.65), p < 0.040), low income (aOR: 1.40, 95% CI (1.05 - 1.88), p = 0.030), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (aOR: 1.80, 95% CI (1.10 - 3.20), p = 0.040). Our study identified the common predictors of non-urgent SER visits in our settings, such as younger age, rural residence, poor socioeconomic status, and lower education level. Combined efforts should focus on improving the triage protocols, access to primary care, patient education, and public health initiatives. Further research should also assess the effectiveness of urgent care clinics and telemedicine in reducing non-urgent ER presentations."

Indications for preservation of fertility have been extended to include any condition that may affect fertility but there is no real consensus regarding patients treated for AT. Primary objective was to compare fertility of patients with AT to a control group (CG, digestive or urological surgery). Secondary objectives were to evaluate time to conception and occurrence of early menopause in both groups and rate of AT recurrence. This retrospective, bicentric study included patients treated for AT in two tertiary University Hospitals, from January 1996 to December 2021, aged less than 43 years and with desire for pregnancy post-operatively. Each patient in AT group was matched with 3 patients of CG according to age and year of surgery. Primary endpoint was post-operative pregnancy rate. Secondary endpoints were time to pregnancy, age at menopause and torsion recurrence rate. 56 patients were included in AT group and 168 in CG. There was no significant difference between AT and CG regarding postoperative pregnancy rate (94.64 % vs 88.69 % respectively (p = 0.299)). There was no difference between AT and CG in mean time to pregnancy (6.89 vs 6.6 months respectively (p = 0.845) and in occurrence of early menopause (1.79 % vs 0.6 % respectively (p = 0.44)). Rate of AT recurrence was 14.3 %. AT does not appear to impact on fertility. There would be no indication for systematic fertility preservation. Further studies are needed to validate these data."

However, CT systemic effects complicate surgical management, especially in emergency scenarios like acute abdomen. This study evaluates outcomes of emergency abdominal surgery in patients undergoing CT. A retrospective analysis was conducted at the Surgical Department of Cardinal Massaia Hospital, Italy, from January 2019 to June 2024. Patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing emergency surgery for acute abdomen within 30 days of CT were included. Data on demographics, CT regimens, surgical and postoperative outcomes, and survival were analyzed using statistical software. Ethical approval was obtained. Thirty patients (15 males, 15 females; mean age 64.2 ± 10.3 years) were included. Indications for surgery included intestinal obstruction (80%), gastrointestinal perforation (13.3%), and colovesical fistula (6.7%). Peritoneal carcinomatosis was present in 66.7%, and R0 resection was achieved in only one case. Derivative colostomies were performed in 30% of cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 20%, but no re-operations or ICU admissions were required. The 30-day mortality rate was 6.7%. CT was resumed in 46.7% of patients, with median survival of 249 days for obstruction cases. Emergency surgery during CT is rare but feasible, with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Prompt resolution of acute conditions allows for CT resumption, improving overall survival. Multicenter studies are needed to validate these findings and establish standardized protocols."

    "abstract": "Evidence regarding the off-hour effect on outcomes in neonates with gastrointestinal disease who received urgent surgical intervention is unknown. Because of the workforce shortage, insufficient experience of surgeons, and delayed radiography examination during off-hours, we hypothesized that emergency surgeries performed during off-hours were associated with worse outcomes. This study aims to analyze the association between the \"off-hour effect\" and adverse events of neonates undergoing emergency gastrointestinal surgery. We extracted patient data from the electronic medical record system at our institution for all neonates undergoing emergency gastrointestinal surgery between July 2018 and October 2021. The primary outcomes were 24-hour and in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were actual postoperative length of stay (PLOS) and the incidence of unplanned re-operation. A total of 275 neonates were identified, and 207 (75.3%) were treated during off-hours. The \"off-hour effect\" was not associated with increased 24-hour mortality, in-hospital mortality, PLOS, and unplanned re-operation. After propensity score matching, 68 off-hours were matched to the nearest 68 on-hours based on their age, weight, gestation weeks, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status. No differences were detected in the primary and secondary outcomes. In this retrospective study with neonates who underwent emergency gastrointestinal surgery, after controlling for age, weight, gestation weeks, and ASA status, surgical and medical outcomes were not different in those undergoing off-hours surgery, which can be considered a surrogate for similar quality of care. However, in the future, a multi-center, prospective study is needed to confirm the results, to overcome the bias related to the presence of only one surgical team."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common small intestine anomaly. Although it is often asymptomatic, in pediatric patients it typically presents as obstruction or lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to ileo-ileal intussusception. We present the case of a pediatric patient in his second decade of life with symptoms of an acute abdomen and laboratory abnormalities suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process. A computed tomography scan revealed small bowel dilation, increased bowel wall diameter, and air-fluid levels. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed an intussusception of a MD. The affected segment was resected, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis. In cases where complications of MD are strongly suspected, the surgeon should opt for surgical management as soon as possible, whether by laparotomy, laparoscopy, or laparoscopically assisted surgery. Regardless of the available options, an appropriate decision should be made based on intraoperative findings and potential postoperative complications. Surgical treatment should depend on intraoperative findings and the surgeon's expertise to ensure a safe and complication-free procedure."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most prevalent surgical emergency in children. This study explores the social and clinical determinants affecting the surgical approach for pediatric appendectomy in Brazil. All patients aged 0-16 years hospitalized and operated on for acute appendicitis in Brazil during 2022 were identified in the Brazilian national healthcare database. Data reviewed included patient demographics, hospital resources and location. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis. We identified 24,088 patients, of which 8768 (36.4%) were female, with a mean age of 10 years. 9690 (40.2%) of patients were white and 14.398 (59.8%) were non-white (including brown, black, asian or indigenous). Geographically, more patients were from the Southeast region. 21,627 (89.8%) of cases were open appendectomies. On univariable analysis, factors significantly influencing the selection of laparoscopic appendectomy included being female, white race, and higher socioeconomic status. The severity of appendicitis did not significantly affect the surgical approach. On multivariable analysis, white race (OR 1.934, [1.759, 2.126]), advanced hospital facilities (OR 5.987, [5.395, 6.644]), and hospitals located in the wealthier Southern region (OR 4.277, [3.884, 4.710]) were significant predictors of a laparoscopic approach. The surgical approach for pediatric appendectomy in Brazil was determined by social determinants rather than by disease severity. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions to ensure equitable healthcare access and approaches in pediatric surgery."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common pediatric surgical emergency, and computed tomography (CT) remains an overused diagnostic test for appendicitis. Our institutional rate of CT utilization for suspected appendicitis was higher than in peer children's hospitals, so we aimed to reduce CT utilization during the evaluation of pediatric appendicitis from 31.3% to 15% within 12 months. From September 2021 to October 2022, we conducted a multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative among patients evaluated for appendicitis in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Interventions included standardizing evaluation with a clinical practice guideline, an order set in the electronic medical record for clinical decision support, and radiologist use of an ultrasound report template. The primary measure was the percentage of patients undergoing evaluation for appendicitis who received an abdominal CT scan. Process measures were the timing of surgical consultation and ultrasound report template use. Balancing measures included negative pathology appendectomies and PED return visits within 72 hours with subsequent appendicitis diagnosis. We analyzed data using statistical process control charts and Nelson rules to detect special cause variation. We evaluated a total of 2,010 patients for acute appendicitis, with 624 representing baseline encounters with a CT rate of 31.3%. Quality improvement interventions reduced the CT rate to 12.1% sustained for 10 months without impacting the rate of negative pathology appendectomy or PED return visits within 72 hours. Quality improvement methodology led to a sustained reduction in CT utilization for patients undergoing evaluation for appendicitis in a PED."

Semi-elective or emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice, while haemorrhagic shock requiring emergency laparotomy is an extremely rare event. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an autoimmune liver disease (AiLD), and its association with bleeding complications remains a clinical observation that lacks robust scientific evidence and comprehensive understanding. Here, we present a case of gallbladder rupture causing haemorrhagic shock in a young patient with a background of cirrhotic PSC. A 29-year-old female with PSC and a history of splenic artery aneurysm previously treated with embolization presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain. A striking feature in the biochemistry results was the high bilirubin level without clinical detection of jaundice. Computed tomography (CT) showed a ruptured gallbladder with active bleeding and haemoperitoneum. Emergency laparotomy was mandated as the patient was becoming progressively haemodynamically unstable. The necrosed gallbladder was resected, and blood was evacuated from the abdominal cavity. The patient recovered well with no postoperative complications observed. HG causing haemodynamic shock is quite a rare complication of acute cholecystitis. This is the first case reported in the literature of internal haemorrhage due to HG in a patient with a background of PSC. This case alerts clinicians dealing with PSC patients who may be susceptible to rare complications of common pathologies. AiLD and their relationship with bleeding events remains unclear and subject of future studies."

    "abstract": "Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication after major surgery, particularly in patients who underwent emergency gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction or perforation surgery. This study aimed to retrospectively assess the incidence and risk factors of POD in this cohort. This study included 583 patients who were diagnosed with GI obstruction or perforation and underwent emergency surgery. POD was diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria or evaluated using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. The risk factors for delirium were analyzed using univariate and multivariate methods. Overall, 106 patients (18.2%) developed delirium within the first 7 days after surgery. The analysis revealed the following independent risk factors: age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.097 [95% CI, 1.065-1.131; P <.001), coronary heart disease (aOR, 3.125 [95% CI, 1.485-6.577; P =.003), hypoproteinemia (aOR, 16.782 [95% CI, 5.484-51.355]; P <.001), septic shock (aOR, 8.565 [95% CI, 4.140-17.721]; P <.001), and intraoperative hypotension (aOR, 4.223 [95% CI, 1.901-9.382]; P <.001). Low-dose dexamethasone (aOR, 0.414 [95% CI, 0.217-0.787]; P =.007) was confirmed as an independent protective factor for POD. The delirium group experienced a significantly longer hospitalization duration, higher 7-day mortality, and increased in-hospital mortality. Our study identified several high-risk factors for POD in patients with acute GI obstruction or perforation conditions. Low-dose dexamethasone may be an independent protective factor."

However, perforated appendicitis is a condition that requires early diagnosis and treatment due to the increased risk of complications. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical values of various biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory parameters in order to distinguish acute appendicitis from perforated appendicitis. A total of 87 participants aged 18-65 y were enrolled in this prospective study. 29 patients with acute appendicitis, 29 patients with perforated appendicitis, and 29 healthy controls were included. Serum urea, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein concentrations were measured using an automated analyser, and whole blood parameters were measured using a haematological analyser. Total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, total thiol (TT), and native thiol (NT) levels were measured photometrically. Oxidative stress index and disulfide (DIS) level were calculated mathematically. Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels were measured photometrically using commercially purchased kits. The elevated levels of urea, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, white blood cell, and platelet count in the acute and perforated appendicitis groups compared to controls, significantly (P < 0.001). Oxidative stress markers (total oxidant status, oxidative stress index, DIS, DIS/TT, DIS/NT, and IMA) were higher, while antioxidant markers (total antioxidant status, TT, NT, and NT/TT) were lower in the appendicitis groups (P < 0.001). Additionally, inflammatory markers IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were elevated, particularly in the perforated appendicitis group (P < 0.05). IMA is a promising biomarker for distinguishing perforated appendicitis from acute appendicitis. Its role, in conjunction with other oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, may enhance diagnostic precision and aid clinicians in timely intervention, potentially reducing complications associated with delayed or missed diagnoses. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings."

    "abstract": "Background: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) of the lower extremities represent a surgical emergency with high morbidity, complex reconstruction, and considerable healthcare demands. Free tissue transfer (FTT) is increasingly utilized for limb salvage in extensive soft tissue defects, yet its implications for hospital resource utilization remain unclear. This study aims to compare clinical outcomes and perioperative resource demands between FTT and local flap (LF) reconstruction in NSTI patients. Methods: A retrospective case series was conducted at a tertiary referral center between September 2022 and January 2025, including eight patients with NSTI of the lower extremity (FTT, n = 4; LF, n = 4). Demographic data, comorbidities, surgical timing, complication profiles, and resource utilization metrics-including operative duration, hospitalization length, and number of procedures-were analyzed. All FTT cases underwent preoperative CT angiography as part of institutional protocol. Results: Mean time to definitive reconstruction was longer in the FTT group (17.25 vs. 8 days, p = 0.15), reflecting staged infection control. FTT procedures demonstrated significantly longer operative times (331.75 vs. 170.25 minutes, p = 0.015), but there was no significant difference in total hospital stay (34.75 vs. 27.71 days, p = 0.65). No cases of flap loss or venous congestion were observed, and outcomes were optimized via delayed dangling protocols. Conclusions: FTT is a viable and effective reconstructive modality for lower extremity NSTIs. Despite increased surgical complexity, FTT did not significantly increase hospital resource utilization, supporting its role in limb preservation among appropriately selected patients."

It predisposes the spleen to torsion, that could purpose infarction, rupture, or gangrene, requiring urgent intervention. We report a 10-year-old girl with a three-day history of acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness, predominantly in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), mimicking appendicitis. Ultrasound and CT showed WS with torsion, showing the characteristic whirl sign. Emergency laparotomy revealed a 720-diploma splenic torsion with necrosis, necessitating splenectomy. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day five. WS is an extraordinary entity (<0.2 % occurrence) with a bimodal age distribution, often affecting adolescents and girls. It can be congenital or acquired and presents variably, from asymptomatic cases to acute abdomen. Torsion leads to vascular compromise, requiring prompt surgical intervention. This case was very interesting to the surgical team for its atypical presentation and its resemblance to perforated appendicitis. WS must be considered in cases of acute abdomen with an absent spleen on imaging. Early recognition and surgical intervention are essential to prevent complications in patients with acute abdomen. Ultrasound and CT are critical for early detection and differentiation from different abdomen emergencies."

The diagnosis was mesocoeliac appendicitis. Imaging was not performed due to lack of access. Laparotomy revealed the necrotic ileal loop, strangulated by an inflammatory appendix. An ileo-caecal resection with terminal ascending ileo-colic anastomosis and cleaning of the peritoneal cavity were performed. Postoperative management was straightforward. Strangulation of the terminal ileum by the appendix is a rare entity causing upper intestinal obstruction by strangulation. We report the 5th case in the literature from sub-Harienne Africa. The etiopathogenesis of this condition is believed to be appendicular length and inflammation. The pathophysiology describes 04 mechanisms, depending on the topography of the appendix. Surgical management is not codified, and depends on intraoperative findings. Appendiceal strangulation of the ileum is a serious condition requiring complex preoperative diagnosis.

While clinical diagnosis is generally effective, it is not perfect, potentially leading to negative appendectomies or delayed treatment. This study investigated the histopathological patterns of appendectomy specimens in King Khalid Hospital, Hail Province, Saudi Arabia, correlating them with preoperative clinical diagnoses to assess diagnostic accuracy and guide optimal management. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 198 patients who underwent appendectomies between August 2023 and July 2024. Resected appendix specimens underwent histopathological examination and were categorized as inflamed, malignant, or benign. Clinical data and histopathological findings were compared using statistical analyses, including Fisher's exact test, to assess diagnostic accuracy and explore potential associations between patient demographics, appendicitis severity, and clinical presentation. The study cohort consisted predominantly of young males (78.8%, mean age: 26 ± 9.2 years), with no pediatric cases included. The most common histopathological finding was an inflamed appendix (99.5%), with acute inflammation being most prevalent (86.9%). Perforation (10.1%) and gangrenous changes (2.5%) were also observed. A rare case of negative appendectomy (0.5%) was attributed to a perforated Meckel's diverticulum. This study demonstrates a high preoperative diagnostic accuracy for acute appendicitis. However, the occurrence of negative appendectomies and complicated cases, particularly in young adult males, highlights the need for continuous vigilance and refinement of diagnostic approaches. Further research exploring age- and sex-specific risk factors for complicated appendicitis is crucial to optimizing patient management strategies and minimizing unnecessary surgical interventions."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common pediatric surgical emergency. Diagnosis may be made by targeted point of care ultrasound (POCUS) of the right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdomen. This can be performed by trained emergency physicians and has similar accuracy to ultrasound performed by radiology technologists and interpreted by radiologists (RADUS) [1,2]. Pediatric patients with appendicitis may present without classical clinical signs and symptoms. Retrocecal appendicitis is often diagnosed late at perforation due to the anatomical position limiting diagnosis with ultrasound, despite the high prevalence of retrocecal appendix as an anatomic variation (up to 65%). Given the limited sensitivity for ultrasound in the diagnosis of appendicitis in patients with retrocecal appendix, these patients often undergo advanced imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially when increased abdominal wall thickness and/or high Body Mass Index (BMI) further limit the ultrasound examination [4-6]. We present a case series of retrocecal appendicitis imaged and diagnosed with POCUS, using novel transducer and patient positioning. In addition to standard graded compression of the RLQ with POCUS, this technique may add to the diagnostic accuracy of patients presenting atypically with anatomic variants."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction (IO) during pregnancy is a rare occurrence. Although uncommon, IO in pregnancy carries a significant risk of maternal and fetal mortality. Diagnosing IO can be challenging, as abdominal pain and vomiting in pregnant patients may be mistaken for labor pain or hyperemesis gravidarum. Early reports strongly recommend exploratory surgery as the standard treatment once IO is diagnosed. The delivery of the baby during the same procedure may be necessary if the surgical emergency jeopardizes the pregnancy. However, this approach is not ideal if the pregnancy is not at term. In recent years, some cases have demonstrated that small bowel intestinal obstruction (SBIO) can be managed conservatively. In our case, we successfully managed the patient conservatively before performing an exploratory laparotomy and lower segment cesarean section in the same setting to prevent maternal and fetal complications. IO without prior surgery is rare, and even more so during pregnancy. Our case highlights a rare instance of pregnancy-related IO caused by band adhesions in the absence of previous surgical history."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is a leading cause of emergency abdominal surgery worldwide, with surgical intervention as its mainstay of treatment. As a primarily clinical diagnosis, it is important for physicians to have ample information to diagnose cases accurately. Given the high rates of negative appendectomies, robust diagnostic workups are crucial to minimize unnecessary surgeries and consider adjunct therapy. Various etiologies, including parasitic infections, are associated with AA. In this review, we report that Schistosoma spp., Enterobius vermicularis (E. vermicularis), Taenia spp., and Ascaris lumbricoides (A. lumbricoides) contribute to or mimic AA. As globalization expands, areas once considered \"safe zones\" for parasites now face higher risks. It is therefore increasingly important for physicians in all countries to recognize the association between parasites and AA and include proper investigations for high-risk patients. Our findings aim to assist physicians on when to consider a parasitic infection and AA, potentially reducing the number of negative appendectomies, as some parasitic infections can be treated with medication alone. To our knowledge, this narrative review incorporating three databases (PubMed, Ovid and Embase), is the first to synthesize research on the relationship between parasites and AA. Articles were screened using Covidence, and inclusion criteria required references to Schistosoma spp., E. vermicularis, Taenia spp., and A. lumbricoides. We limited results to English and French manuscripts published between 1949 and 2023. Two independent reviewers performed title and abstract screening, followed by full-text analysis, ultimately selecting 71 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identifies four parasitic organisms strongly associated with AA-Schistosoma spp., E. vermicularis, Taenia spp., and A. lumbricoides-and highlights countries where these infections are most prevalent. Furthermore, it highlights the need for more research in this area as causal relationships are still yet to be made. While strong associations exist between parasitic infections and AA, further research is needed to establish a causal relationship."

    "abstract": "Abdominal disorders represent 10 to 15% of all Emergency Department visits in elderly patients. This educational review focuses on acute abdomen pathologies specific to the elderly and on their imaging patterns and proposes a strategy for performing CT scans in this population. Bowel obstruction is the most common cause of emergency surgery in the elderly with a higher proportion of colonic obstructions, in particular obstructive colorectal cancer and sigmoid volvulus. Concerning abdominal inflammatory processes, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and diverticulitis, gangrenous cholecystitis and complicated appendicitis are relatively frequently encountered due to delayed diagnoses. Bowel ischemia, which includes acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and ischemic colitis (IC), is also much more common after the age of 80. Although ischemic colitis is mainly related to cardiovascular risk factors, it can also result from a persistent distension above a colonic cancer or from fecal impaction. Finally, extra-abdominal pathologies responsible for acute abdominal pain, such as inferior myocardial infarction, should not be overlooked. In clinical practice, when possible thanks to sufficient and appropriate radiological resources, we recommend a scan without injection of contrast and an injection depending on the results of the unenhanced scan, decided by the radiologist present at the CT scan room during the examination. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: CT is critical in the diagnosis and management of patients over 75 years old with an acute abdomen, given the difficulty of clinico-biological diagnosis, the frequency of complicated forms, and the morbidity induced by delayed diagnosis. KEY POINTS: The most common site and cause of bowel obstruction in the elderly is large bowel obstruction due to colon cancer. Discrepancy between a poor clinical examination and complicated forms on imaging, particularly for inflammation and infections, is responsible for late diagnosis and increased morbidity. Ischemia, including of the small bowel, colon, and gallbladder are common cause of acute abdomen in elderly. In patients with upper quadrant pain, consider extra-abdominal causes such as pneumonia or myocardial infarction."

    "abstract": "Mesothelioma arises from mesothelial cells. This tumor is very rare among pediatric abdominal neoplasms. We herein report an extremely rare case of acute abdomen with cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum in a child. A 14-year-old boy was referred to our hospital for emergency surgery. Surgery revealed a primary tumor arising from the greater omentum. The tumor was macroscopically diagnosed as a benign omental lymphangioma and was resected en bloc with the greater omentum. A histopathological examination of the tumor revealed a simple columnar epithelium-like mesothelioma with poor cell-atypia. Immunohistochemical examination showed antibody reactivity in the cyst epithelium, including an anti-calretinin antibody. The final pathological diagnosis was a mesothelioma originating from the peritoneum. In pediatric cases diagnosed with cystic lymphatic malformation, the possibility of peritoneal mesothelioma needs to be considered and carefully confirmed or ruled out."

    "abstract": "Transmesenteric hernia caused by mesenteric defects are rare causes of intestinal obstruction in children. Here, we report a rare mesenteric defect, which was completely mesenteric in absence, with the defect extending from the mesenteric root to the ascending colon. A 4-year-old Han Chinese boy presented to the surgical emergency department with a 1-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. An X-ray examination of the abdomen revealed intestinal obstruction. The patient was diagnosed with intestinal obstruction and was advised to undergo laparoscopy. Laparoscopy revealed a large mesenteric defect, with the defect extending from the mesenteric root to the ascending colon, and a single mesenteric vessel supplied the small intestine. The single mesenteric vessel passed along the small intestine and crossed with the distal ileum, which trapped the distal ileum, leading to intestinal obstruction. During surgery, the distal ileum was transected and reanastomosed in front of the mesenteric vessel to relieve the intestinal obstruction, and the mesenteric defect was closed to prevent mesenteric hiatal hernia. There was no recurrence of intestinal obstruction during the follow-up. A complete mesenteric defect with ileal volvulus is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction. Prompt exploration based on clinical signs is mandatory to establish the diagnosis and provide immediate therapy. This can reduce morbidity and mortality in this rare life-threatening disease."

    "abstract": "Pediatric gallbladder torsion is a rare but potentially life-threatening cause of acute abdomen. The first case was reported in the 19th century, yet the precise pathogenesis remains unclear. Due to its nonspecific symptoms, gallbladder torsion in children is frequently misdiagnosed as more common conditions, such as acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, or gastrointestinal infections. A 2-year and 4-month-old boy was admitted to our emergency department with abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Initial blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 13.13 × 109/L, neutrophil percentage at 76.1%, and an absolute neutrophil count of 9.99 × 109/L. Abdominal CT indicated thickened gallbladder walls, a partially blurred appendix margin, an intraluminal dense shadow, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes, along with pelvic effusion. A diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. Emergency laparoscopy showed a suppurative appendix, leading to an appendectomy. Further inspection revealed a 360° counterclockwise torsion of the gallbladder neck with necrosis and black discoloration, without perforation. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. Nine days postoperatively, the child developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, necessitating transfer to the pediatric respiratory department, and was discharged on postoperative day 19 with no complications. Laparoscopic exploration for pediatric acute appendicitis should include the gallbladder as a standard investigation target."

Emergency laparotomy was performed due to patient's declining condition. A large hematoma in the mesentery of the splenic flexure of the descending colon was observed, and resection of the descending colon and hematoma was performed. Pathological examination revealed aneurysmal dilation of an IMA branch within the hematoma. Affected blood vessels exhibited extreme thinning due to fibrinoid necrosis, possibly caused by SLE. The patient was discharged 28 days after the initial surgery without complications. Aneurysm rupture should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in patients with SLE."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide, with significant variations in prevalence, presentation and outcomes between high-income countries (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Complicated appendicitis has significant implications for low- and lower-middle-income countries due to limited healthcare resources. While there is extensive evidence for HICs, the evidence for low- and lower-middle-income countries is lacking. This systematic review aimed to compare the prevalence of complicated appendicitis between low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LoMICs). A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42024526007). Observational studies and randomized controlled trials published in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus (1990-2024) were retrieved. A grey literature search of Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library was also performed to identify existing reviews on the topic. The primary outcome investigated was the incidence of complicated appendicitis. Eighty-seven articles with 25 582 participants were included. Meta-analyses of outcomes comparing LICs to LoMICs identified an increased pooled proportion of complicated appendicitis (34% (95% CI 27%-41%) vs. 23% (95% CI 19%-27%) P < 0.001), increased post-operative morbidity (19% (95% CI 13%-27%) vs. 13% (95% CI 8%-20%): P < 0.01) and mortality (OR 2.36). Appendicitis remains a major burden in LICs and LoMICs with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. These findings highlight critical deficiencies in surgical access and delivery, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to improve outcomes in these settings."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Volvulus of the caecum, ascending colon and first third of the transverse colon is a very rare surgical emergency. Timely diagnosis and intervention can avert serious complications. Case Report: A 54-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with colicky epigastric pain radiating to the left iliac fossa that lasted for 12 h. Vital signs were stable upon arrival at the hospital. Physical examination revealed that left abdomen and suprapubic fullness and bowel sounds were recorded, and rebound tests were negative. Laboratory results were neutrophils: 78% (35%-72%), lymphocytes: 16% (20%-45%), HB: 11 g/dL (12-16), HCT: 33% (36%-48%); all the rest were normal. Furthermore, computed tomography revealed a distended close of the large bowel extending from the left hypochondrium to the left iliac fossa. During explorative laparotomy, volvulus of the first third of the transverse, ascending colon and caecum was detected. Because the viability of the bowel wall was compromised, right extended hemicolectomy was performed with consequent ileotransverse anastomosis. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. Conclusions: Expeditious diagnosis and early intervention of very rare surgical emergencies such as ascending colon volvulus may avert disastrous complications."

    "abstract": "Introduction Immediate diagnosis of bowel necrosis in acute abdominal conditions is essential for proper treatment. Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has recently emerged as a tool to assess intestinal viability in bowel ischemia. However, DECT's diagnostic accuracy for bowel necrosis in clinical practice remains undefined. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study at a Japanese tertiary care hospital assessed DECT's diagnostic accuracy for bowel necrosis. We included patients who underwent emergency operations for abdominal conditions with bowel ischemia from April 2013 to March 2022. Patients without DECT were excluded. The reference standard was bowel necrosis determined by surgical findings. Four evaluators (two residents and two specialists) independently reviewed DECT images blinded to confirmed diagnoses. We calculated pooled and individual sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and accuracy. Results Twenty-eight patients were included. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-0.77) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.92), respectively. Residents demonstrated higher sensitivity than specialists. Pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 3.76 (95% CI, 2.02-7.00) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.29-0.61). Overall accuracy was 0.73 (95%CI, 0.64-0.81). Inter-evaluator agreement was moderate (Fleiss' kappa, 0.42). Conclusion DECT demonstrated moderate diagnostic accuracy for bowel necrosis in this Japanese tertiary care setting. While clinically valuable, DECT's diagnostic capability was not definitive. To optimize DECT's potential, future research should employ disease-specific image reconstruction techniques and provide evaluators with specialized DECT interpretation training."

    "abstract": "Peritoneal pseudocysts are benign, fluid-filled structures that arise from the accumulation of intra-abdominal fluid, which would typically be reabsorbed by the peritoneum. These pseudocysts form when peritoneal integrity is disrupted by adhesions, often secondary to trauma, surgery, or infection. While intraperitoneal pseudocysts are rare, they are most frequently associated with inflammatory processes, including ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications, catheter-related infections. Sclerosing peritonitis (SP), a rare but serious complication of long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, is characterized by marked thickening of the peritoneal membranes. Histologically, these membranes consist of dense fibrotic connective tissue infiltrated by mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. The pathogenesis of SP-associated pseudocysts is thought to involve low-grade infection or localized chronic inflammation. A 59-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presented to the emergency department with chronic abdominal pain. Computed tomography imaging revealed a large peritoneal pseudocyst. During exploratory midline laparotomy, the pseudocyst was successfully evacuated, and the peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed."

However, this condition can present with atypical signs, creating diagnostic challenges for clinicians. We report an unusual case of acute appendicitis in a 53-year-old male, who exhibited the incidental finding of Grey Turner's sign on the right flank. Grey Turner's sign in the context of acute appendicitis initially raised suspicion of other conditions causing retroperitoneal haemorrhage, such as acute pancreatitis, as the primary differential diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Bladder rupture can occur as a late complication of radiation therapy targeting the pelvic organs. It is often diagnosed as peritonitis caused by intraperitoneal urine leakage. We report a case of an internal hernia and strangulated ileus caused by a bladder wall defect that occurred due to bladder rupture, which served as the hernia orifice. The patient was a woman in her 70s who had undergone radical hysterectomy and postoperative radiation therapy for cervical cancer 37 years prior. She was diagnosed with a strangulated ileus and underwent emergency surgery for abdominal pain. Intraoperative findings revealed moderate amounts of clear yellow ascites and a bladder wall defect with small intestinal incarceration, leading to a strangulated ileus. The strangulated bowel was resected and the bladder wall was trimmed and sutured. A histological examination of the trimmed bladder wall revealed findings consistent with late complications of radiation cystitis. Bladder rupture is characterized by nonspecific findings, making the diagnosis difficult. It is often diagnosed during surgery for acute abdomen. In this case, the small intestine was incarcerated at the bladder rupture site, causing strangulated ileus, a previously unreported condition. Although rare, bladder rupture should be considered a cause of strangulated ileus in the pelvic region."

    "abstract": "Traumatic transmesenteric hernia (TTMH) is an exceptionally rare condition with high morbidity and mortality, particularly in children. It can cause life-threatening complications such as ischemic enterocolitis. Internal hernias, including transmesenteric types, are difficult to diagnose preoperatively and are often discovered during emergency laparotomy. A 13-year-old girl presented with acute abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and hypovolemic shock. She had sustained blunt abdominal trauma from a fall two weeks earlier. Initial resuscitation and imaging raised concerns for acute intestinal obstruction. Due to clinical deterioration, an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a transmesenteric hernia with 120 cm of ischemic ileum. Bowel resection and a double-barrel ileostomy were performed. Histopathology confirmed ischemic enterocolitis secondary to the hernia. The patient recovered well and later underwent successful ileostomy reversal. Transmesenteric hernias are rare, typically congenital or post-surgical, with traumatic cases being extremely uncommon. Diagnosis is challenging due to a lack of specific clinical findings. Delayed intervention increases the risk of bowel ischemia and mortality. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulty of TTMH and emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion in trauma patients presenting with acute abdomen. Educating patients with trauma about warning signs & follow up is the recommendation."

It's often accompanied by bilious vomiting, which may occur with or without abdominal distension. Midgut volvulus is a major complication that can arise from malrotation, presenting a significant risk to life and requiring immediate surgical intervention. This is the first case report of midgut volvulus with complete malrotation in an infant from Somalia. Our case is a 40-day old term male presented with bilious vomiting and constipation for 5 days. He was resuscitated and underwent Color Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen that showed the whirlpool sign and reversal of superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein. Following the Ladd's procedure, he was discharged from the hospital, demonstrating effective feeding and the absence of vomiting. Intestinal malrotation, a congenital anomaly affecting approximately 1 in 500 live births, carries a significant risk of midgut volvulus, a life-threatening surgical emergency. This report presents the first documented case of complete intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus in an infant from Somalia, highlighting the challenges of diagnosis and management in resource-constrained settings. The case highlights the importance of accessible diagnostic tools and prompt surgical intervention.

This study introduces an innovative approach by integrating clinical, laboratory, and imaging features with advanced machine-learning techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy in pediatric appendicitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 782 pediatric patients from the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Data set. Clinical scores, laboratory markers, and imaging findings were analyzed. Statistical comparisons were performed using independent t-tests and χ 2 tests, with significance set at p < 0.05. Predictive models, including logistic regression and machine learning classifiers, were developed and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Significant differences were observed in clinical scores (e.g., Alvarado Score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score) and laboratory markers (e.g., WBC count and neutrophil percentage) between appendicitis (AA) and non-appendicitis (Non-AA) groups (p < 0.001). Imaging features, including appendix diameter, also demonstrated diagnostic value. Among predictive models, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy (94.5%), with strong precision (93.8%) and recall (95.2%) for appendicitis diagnosis. This study represents a novel application of machine learning models, particularly Random Forest, to enhance diagnostic accuracy for pediatric appendicitis.

Acute abdomen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a challenging diagnostic and therapeutic problem that carries high mortality and morbidity rates. The present study reports a case of a 45-year-old female, a known case of SLE, hypothyroidism, and seizure disorder. The patient presented with chief complaints of pain in the left iliac and lumbar region with a history of amenorrhea for three to four months. Based on the clinical findings, laboratory investigations, and diagnostic assessment involving ultrasonography (USG), the diagnosis of acute abdomen along with tubo-ovarian mass with dermoid cyst and SLE with lupus nephritis and seizure disorder was confirmed. The patient was operated with total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with loop colostomy. The patient was placed in the surgical intensive care unit for observation; however, sepsis developed, and the trauma from the exploratory laparotomy led to septic shock, followed by hypotension and ultimately cardiac arrest. Hence, the cause of death was attributed to sepsis with shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. In conclusion, acute abdomen in SLE suggests that systemic measurement and early laparotomy may improve the prognosis; however, due to chronic inflammatory status and immune-compromised state, the cases should be handled with utmost caution with a multidisciplinary approach due to the increase in the mortality rate."

The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Bologna guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for managing adhesive SBO, promoting timely surgical intervention (or non-operative management (NOM) when ischaemia, strangulation, or peritonitis are absent). However, guideline adoption and its impact on outcomes remain under studied. Compliance with the Bologna guidelines was evaluated to determine the impact of compliance on outcomes. SnapSBO, a prospective, multicentre, time-bound, observational cohort study, captured data on patients with adhesive SBO across diverse healthcare settings and patient populations. Patient care was categorized into: successful NOM, surgery after an unsuccessful appropriate trial of NOM (NOM-T), and direct to surgery (DTS). Compliance with diagnostic, therapeutic, and postoperative Bologna guideline recommendations was assessed as either complete or partial. Primary outcomes included adherence to the Bologna guidelines, LOS, complications, and the incidence of the composite metric 'optimal outcomes' (LOS ≤5 days, discharge without complications, and no readmission within 30 days). Among 982 patients with adhesive SBO, successful NOM occurred in 561 (57.1%), 224 (22.8%) underwent NOM-T, and 197 (20.1%) proceeded DTS. The mean(s.d.) LOS was 5.3(9.0), 12.9(11.4), and 7.7(8.0) days respectively (P < 0.001). Optimal outcomes were achieved in 61.0%, 16.1%, and 37.6% respectively (P < 0.001) and full guideline compliance was observed in 17.2%, 10.1%, and 0.4% respectively. Patients with adhesive SBO whose care was aligned with the Bologna guidelines had a shorter LOS and a greater incidence of optimal outcomes. Addressing evidence-to-practice gaps through implementation strategies that consider contextual factors will enhance guideline adoption and patient outcomes. Small bowel obstruction happens when the intestine becomes blocked, often due to scar tissue from previous surgery. It is a common reason people are admitted to hospitals for emergency surgery worldwide. Doctors have created clear guidelines (expert advice) on how best to treat this condition to improve patient outcomes. This study looked at whether doctors follow these guidelines and how it affects patient results. Researchers found that hospitals frequently struggle to fully follow the guidelines because they lack necessary resources or due to differences in medical practices. Improving how closely doctors follow these guidelines could help patients recover faster and experience fewer complications."

This prospective case series study enrolled patients with non-traumatic acute abdomen from the Hospital between January 2021 and September 2021. The volumes of pelvic and peritoneal effusion, as estimated by ultrasound findings of free fluid, were compared with the actual volumes observed during subsequent surgery. Eighty-six patients underwent surgery within 7 h after ultrasound findings of free fluid.

In rare cases, SRUB may present with multiorgan dysfunction including acute liver and kidney failure, complicating management and recovery. It is commonly associated with underlying bladder dysfunction, including chronic urinary retention and bladder outlet obstruction. We report a 58-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who presented with acute abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, and hemodynamic instability. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, renal impairment, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia, as well as elevated bilirubin and liver enzyme levels. Abdominopelvic CT with cystography confirmed SRUB, showing contrast extravasation. The patient underwent an urgent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed two bladder tears that were successfully repaired. Postoperative care included broad-spectrum antibiotics, hemodialysis, and intensive monitoring, leading to a full recovery. SRUB is often misdiagnosed due to its resemblance to gastrointestinal and renal pathologies. This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion in patients with risk factors such as bladder outlet obstruction. CT cystography is crucial for early diagnosis, while surgical repair remains the gold standard for treatment. Supportive care, including hemodialysis and infection control, is vital for optimizing outcomes. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are critical in managing SRUB. Clinicians should consider this rare condition in patients with acute abdomen and known bladder dysfunction to reduce morbidity and improve prognosis."

In the treatment of TAAD, the timing of surgery and the choice of surgical procedure are of paramount importance. Open total aortic arch reconstruction remains the gold standard for aortic arch surgery and is one of the most challenging procedures. However, this approach is invasive, relatively lengthy, and associated with substantial bleeding, which necessitates high levels of operator skill and carries the risk of multiple complications, particularly neurological ones. This report describes a novel hybrid procedure named Open Ascending Aorta Replacement Combined with Fenestrated Total Aortic Arch Stenting. A case was selected in which the lesion did not involve the aortic arch, at least on the greater curvature side of the arch. Ascending aortic replacement was performed, followed by arch intervention with self-modified stent grafts to preserve the aortic arch native branches. This approach allows for a rapid simplification of the procedure, avoids deep hypothermia or circulatory arrest associated with conventional open surgery, and mitigates neurological complications."

Small bowel pathologies present a diagnostic challenge due to their diverse range and frequently overlapping clinical presentation. In oncology patients, structural changes resulting from tumor growth, surgery and treatment effects can further complicate the diagnostic process. Due to a weakened immune system, oncology patients are also highly susceptible to infections of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Traditional computed tomography (CT) scans are used as the gold standard diagnostic modality. However, three-dimensional (3D) postprocessing techniques including maximal intensity projection (MIP), volume rendering (VR) and cinematic rendering (CR) have been employed to aid image evaluation. For a balanced and organized approach to describe diagnostic challenges in this complex population, we have divided the pictorial essay into two parts. The first part focuses on tumor- and infection-associated causes, as summarized below in the visual abstract.

A total of 36 patients under 18 years with appendicitis were enrolled (18 in the TULAA group and 18 in the CLA group). Primary outcomes assessed included operative time, pain (using visual analogue scale, or VAS), complications, wound issues, hospital stay, conversion rate, and cosmetic acceptance. TULAA demonstrated a significantly shorter operative time (p<0.001) and lower postoperative pain (p=0.0009) compared to CLA. Hospital stay was shorter in the TULAA group (p=0.0008). While no significant difference in postoperative complications (p=0.1456) was observed, cosmetic acceptance was notably better in TULAA (p<0.001). TULAA is a quick, safe, and cosmetically superior alternative to CLA in pediatric appendicitis, offering shorter operative time, reduced pain, and enhanced recovery."

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) is a surgical emergency condition associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. Despite scattered studies, there exists a gap in comprehensive evidence on management outcomes of this condition in Ethiopia. Hence, this review aimed to assess the pooled mortality and complication rates along with their predictors in patients treated for PPU. In this review, an extensive search across various electronic databases including PubMed, Africa Index Medicus, Science Direct, and Hinari was conducted. Additionally, searches were conducted in Google Scholar and online library repositories of Addis Ababa, Hawassa, and Bahir Dar Universities, complemented by manual searches of included studies. Data extraction was performed using Excel and the analysis was done using STATA 17 software. Pooled estimates of mortality and complication rates were determined using a random-effect model, while associated predictors were identified through the analysis using a fixed-effect model. Subgroup analysis for mortality rate was conducted by region. Sensitivity analysis was performed after assessing heterogeneity using the I2 test, and potential publication bias was examined through funnel plots, along with Egger's and Begg's tests. This meta-analysis, encompassing 9 studies, revealed a pooled mortality rate of 6.68% (95% CI: 4.36, 9.00) with a high level of heterogeneity (I2 = 57%) and a complication rate of 23.21% (95% CI: 19.72, 26.69) with a moderate level of heterogeneity (I2 = 43%) in patients treated for PPU. Notably, presentation after 24 h exhibited 4 times higher odds (95% CI: 1.79-8.95) of developing complications, while low systolic blood pressure (AOR 4.81; 95% CI: 1.75-13.20) was associated with increased complication risk. In Ethiopia, morbidity and mortality following PPU management are significant, influenced by delayed presentation, low systolic blood pressure, and advanced age. Timely interventions, early hemodynamic stabilization, and age-specific considerations are vital to improving outcomes. CRD42024497946."

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcers (PPU) represent a critical surgical emergency. Despite the historical predominance of open surgical repair, laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches have shown promise in reducing morbidity and hospital stay. This study aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis comparing open, laparoscopic, and endoscopic interventions for PPU repair. A systematic search of Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) databases identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing these approaches. The primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and morbidity. Eight RCTs including 657 patients were analyzed. Endoscopic interventions were associated with fewer respiratory complications and shorter hospital stays, while the laparoscopic approach demonstrated fewer surgical site infections and less postoperative pain compared to open repair. Other outcomes demonstrated non-significant differences across interventions. Prompt resuscitation and surgical repair, either laparoscopic or open, remains the gold standard for PPU. Endoscopic techniques are viable alternatives for small perforations and in selected cases where general anesthesia is contraindicated."

They have been a useful tool for clinicians for the initial assessment of abdominal pain. With the advent of modern radiological modalities, their usefulness has diminished, particularly in developed countries. AXRs are often considered unwarranted in many conditions and are associated with radiation exposure; hence, their use has become limited worldwide, and many studies suggest the careful use of AXRs. AXR should be used more judiciously and not as a routine investigative tool. The benefits and hazards should be considered before performing an X-ray to understand abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of surgical acute abdomen. Currently, laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) is the most frequently preferred surgical approach. As with all laparoscopic procedures, the possibility of conversion to open surgery also exists in LA. This study aims to identify the risk factors associated with conversion to open appendectomy (OA) during the laparoscopic management of AA. This retrospective case-control study included 445 patients who underwent LA for AA between 2018 and 2023. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether conversion to OA was required during the laparoscopic procedure. Preoperative demographic, clinical, and perioperative data were evaluated. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. The median age of the 445 patients included in the study was 34 years (interquartile range: 25-49). Of these, 58.2% were male. The overall conversion rate to open surgery was 3.8%. In univariate analyses, factors such as age (p=0.002), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (p=0.011), time of arrival at the emergency department (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) level (p<0.001), amylase level (p=0.012), Malatya Complicated Appendicitis Prediction Score (MCAPS) ≥6 (p<0.001), and presence of complicated appendicitis (p<0.001) were associated with conversion. However, in multivariate analyses, only an MCAPS score of 6 or higher (p=0.034) was identified as an independent risk factor for conversion. Since conversion to OA is sometimes unavoidable in the management of AA, clinicians may benefit from using the easily applicable MCAPS to predict the likelihood of conversion. This scoring system may also assist in considering primary OA when appropriate."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection represents a critical cardiac surgical emergency and carries a significant mortality risk. While computed tomography angiography is the standard for initial diagnosis, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is indispensable in the intraoperative setting. This article discusses intraoperative TEE findings in patients undergoing surgery for type A aortic dissection, emphasizing the necessity of real-time imaging to detect complications and guide surgical management. The use of TEE is important in confirming diagnoses, monitoring hemodynamics, evaluating the function of the aortic valve, pericardial, and pleural spaces, and potentially assessing abdominal branch vessel flow, thus ultimately facilitating informed surgical decisions. Moreover, intraoperative TEE use enables differentiation between true and false lumens and facilitates central aortic cannulation guidance via the Seldinger technique. Post-cardiopulmonary bypass, TEE is used to assess surgical results and guide further interventions if necessary. This comprehensive review aims to disseminate essential echocardiographic insights, advocating for greater awareness and utilization of TEE in the surgical management of aortic dissection to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children. Prior radiology studies have described Puylaert staging on ultrasound to determine the severity of appendicitis. We investigated the feasibility and utility of assessing Puylaert staging on emergency department (ED) point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to differentiate uncomplicated from complicated appendicitis in children. This was a pilot feasibility study of children ages 5-17 diagnosed with acute appendicitis in nine pediatric EDs. POCUS was performed by trained ED physicians. Puylaert staging of the submucosal layer was used to categorize the severity of appendicitis (stages 1-4) and was compared with surgical pathology reports. Test characteristics were computed to evaluate the accuracy of POCUS in differentiating appendicitis severity. Physicians recorded time to complete POCUS, ease of use, and their perception of acceptability by patients and families. Of 72 patients with complete data, all patients with uncomplicated appendicitis were accurately identified using POCUS (Puylaert stage 1 or 2). The sensitivity for identifying complicated appendicitis (Puylaert Stage 3 or 4) was 100% (95% CI: 77%-100%), and specificity was 65% (95% CI: 52%-78%). Ninety four percent of physicians agreed that the POCUS was easy to perform. One hundred percent agreed that it was well accepted by families. The average time to complete POCUS was 8 min. This study supports the feasibility and utility of assessing Puylaert staging by POCUS for children with appendicitis in the ED. High sensitivity to rule out complicated cases coupled with ease of use and perceived patient acceptance make this a potential adjunct to aid in the management of pediatric appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Pediatric gonadal torsion is a critical surgical emergency requiring immediate diagnosis and intervention to preserve reproductive capabilities. This review addresses the diagnostic challenges, imaging patterns, and management strategies for both ovarian and testicular torsion, including a brief discussion on the emerging role of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS), therefore filling a significant gap in the literature. We emphasize the need for a high index of suspicion due to often nonspecific clinical presentations, particularly in ovarian torsion. An accurate and swift diagnosis allows conservative surgical intervention to be offered, which is crucial to maximize gonadal salvage and minimize recurrence. While we highlight CEUS's potential benefits in enhancing diagnostic clarity without ionizing radiation, ultrasound and other modalities such as MRI and CT, have a paramount role in this setting. Future research comparing CEUS with MRI is essential to validate its diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness, potentially revolutionizing acute care diagnostics. Incorporating CEUS into diagnostic workflows, along with a deep understanding of the condition's epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation, may probably significantly improve patient outcomes. We detail the characteristic imaging features, diagnostic pitfalls, and differential diagnoses essential for radiologists, with particular relevance for residents and those with limited pediatric radiology exposure. This review aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps and serve as a robust educational tool, facilitating better clinical decision-making and outcomes in pediatric gonadal torsion cases."

Chronic alcohol consumption and vitamin B-complex deficiencies are contributing factors. Acute cases may present with a range of neurological symptoms, including seizures and coma. Subacute and chronic forms can lead to interhemispheric disconnection syndrome and progressive dementia. We present the case of a young male patient's first hospital admission due to an acute decline in conscious level. A detailed history revealed regular alcohol consumption and substandard living conditions. The deterioration in consciousness was attributed to the diagnosis of MBD based on neurological signs, characteristic brain imaging findings, and a history of alcohol use. In addition, a small bowel perforation was also diagnosed. Supportive therapy and thiamine were initiated, and the patient was transferred to surgery for an operation. After two surgeries, the perforation was covered. The patient's level of consciousness showed slight improvement; however, the psychiatrist noted severe cognitive deficits. Ultimately, the patient entered a septic state and passed away. Acute MBD can potentially cause altered mental state, coma, and death; however, cases can be complicated by other emergency conditions. This case demonstrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach."

The presentation of this condition often resembles that of typical calculous cholecystitis, requiringW a high level of clinical suspicion to diagnose and treat it promptly. It is essential to comprehend the clinical subtleties of GBV due to its infrequency and difficulties in diagnosis to prevent serious consequences. We present the case of an 86-year-old frail woman who presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset vomiting and acute abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a distended gall bladder with massive wall thickening and biliary tree dilation, suggestive of biliary obstruction due to gall bladder torsion. Emergent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, revealing a torsed gall bladder with gangrene and intramural haemorrhage. Post-operative management included antibiotics, and the patient experienced an uneventful recovery. This case emphasises the need to consider GBV as a differential diagnosis for elderly patients experiencing acute abdominal symptoms. Advanced imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, play an important role in detecting GBV preoperatively and aiding treatment planning. Surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of GBV treatment, necessitating precise surgical techniques to avoid complications. The rarity of GBV and its similarity to acute cholecystitis makes it difficult to diagnose. This case emphasises the significance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for GBV, especially in frail elderly patients."

Ultrasound-guided saline hydrostatic reduction (SHR) is a nonoperative technique used in its management which can avoid surgery in a clinically stable and uncomplicated child. The aim of this study was to assess the success rates of SHR in a tertiary care center and also to assess any relationship between success of reduction with age of patient, duration of symptoms, and site of intussusception. This was a retrospective study conducted in a single tertiary care center for 3 years. All patients who had undergone an attempt at hydrostatic reduction were included in the study. Children who directly underwent surgery were excluded from the study. All pertinent demographic and clinical data were collected from the medical records department, tabulated, and analyzed. Statistical testing was conducted with SPSS Statistics 23.0. Among a total of 103 patients, 93 underwent successful reduction (90.2%). The comparison between success of reduction with age of patients or with site of intussusception was not significant. Success of reduction was also compared with the duration of symptoms at presentation, with increased success seen in early presenters. Ultrasound-guided SHR of intussusception is an effective method with success rates of 90.2% and can be safely implemented in children who are clinically stable, irrespective of age and site, with increased success seen in early presenters."

PTDH is a rare condition, occurring in 3%-7% of all thoracoabdominal injuries. Approximately 14.6% of PTDH cases present months to years after the initial trauma. Cases of delayed PTDH complicated by bowel obstruction and perforation are exceedingly uncommon, with a reported prevalence of 0.17%-6%. In Africa, fewer than 10 cases of delayed PTDH have been documented over the past three decades. Despite the availability of published reports, there are no established practice guidelines for managing PTDH. Here, we present a case of delayed PTDH that manifested as acute bowel obstruction 12 years after a gunshot wound to the chest. The condition led to a fatal postoperative outcome. This case highlights the critical need for clinicians to consider PTDH in patients with a history of trauma presenting with acute bowel obstruction and underscores the importance of urgent surgical management to prevent fatal complications."

A six-year-old male presented with signs of intestinal obstruction. Abdominal ultrasound revealed classic target signs, and the patient was taken for emergency laparotomy. Intraoperatively, a retrograde ileo-ileal intussusception into a giant Meckel's diverticulum was discovered, necessitating resection and end-to-end ileo-ileal anastomosis.

Our study is aimed at evaluating the incidence and associated risk factors of complicated AA among children presenting with this condition. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional design, we included all children suspected of having AA who were admitted to a tertiary pediatric center in Iran from 2020 to 2021. Pathologists examined all surgically removed appendices, and only cases with histopathological confirmation of AA were included. We classified AA into complicated and uncomplicated categories. We recorded and analyzed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients admitted with AA. Analyzed laboratory parameters included white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count and percentage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: The study comprised 98 pediatric patients with AA, including 60 males (61.2%) and 38 females (38.8%), with a median age of 9.0 (interquartile range: 7.0-11.0) years. Eighteen (18.4%) cases were diagnosed with complicated AA. Mean WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with complicated AA (p values: 0.048, 0.018, and 0.014, respectively). After adjusting for relevant clinical factors, CRP (odds ratio: 1.02 [95% CI: 1.00-1.04]), WBC count (1.18 [1.03-1.37]), and neutrophil count (1.23 [1.06-1.45)]) were significantly associated with complicated AA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated a CRP cut-off of 19.5 mg/dL, with an area under the curve of 0.687 (95% CI: 0.551-0.823), a sensitivity of 72.2%, and a specificity of 68.4% for predicting complicated AA. Conclusions: Laboratory parameters, specifically WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels, are significant independent predictors of complicated AA in pediatric patients. These findings could assist in the timely diagnosis and management of children suspected of having AA in clinical practice."

Nevertheless, the therapeutic efficacy of this surgical approach remains to be improved. Thus, the exploration and implementation of surgical refinements are necessary. To elucidate the therapeutic effectiveness and influencing factors of laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) with mesoappendix dissection in the treatment of AP. First, 150 patients with AP who visited Shangrao Municipal Hospital between January 2022 and June 2024 were enrolled in this study. Among them, 72 patients were assigned to the control group to receive conventional LA, whereas 78 cases were included in the observation group for LA with mesoappendix dissection. Subsequently, indicators such as therapeutic effectiveness, surgical indices (operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and hospital stay), postoperative recovery indices (time to ambulation, gastrointestinal function recovery time, and time to food intake), incidence of adverse events (postoperative bleeding, pelvic infection, puncture site infection, and ileus), and serum inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)] were collected and comparatively analyzed, and the influencing factors of therapeutic effectiveness in patients with AP were analyzed. Compared with the control group, the observation group had higher clinical therapeutic effectiveness, less operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and hospital stay; shorter time to ambulation, gastrointestinal function recovery, and food intake; and a lower total incidence of adverse events, and this difference is statistically significant. In addition, the expression levels of various serum inflammatory factors in the observation group were significantly reduced postoperatively, which were markedly lower than those in the control group. Moreover, sex, age, body mass index, time from acute onset to admission, family medical history, preoperative TNF-α, preoperative IL-6, preoperative CRP, and treatment modality were identified to be not independent factors affecting the therapeutic effectiveness of LA with mesoappendix dissection in patients with AP. Overall, LA with mesoappendix dissection has a remarkable curative effect in treating patients with AP, which is worthy of clinical promotion."

Although NF can affect any part of the body, the upper limbs are a notable site, accounting for 27% of cases. Antibiotics and surgical debridement form the basis of treatment. We conducted a retrospective study on NF of the upper limb requiring surgical intervention from 1998-2018 using data from Hospital Episode Statistics. Age, sex, deprivation index, length of stay (LOS) and complications were analysed. We identified 728 patients, comprising 468 males and 260 females, with a mean age of 54.97 years (95% CI: 53.76-56.17 years). The incidence of NF in the upper limb increased from 0.0035 per 100,000 in 1998 to 0.01 per 100,000 in 2018. Lower index of multiple deprivation scores correlated with higher NF prevalence, with 67.32% (n=474) presenting scores between 0 and 5. The average LOS was 27.55 days (95% CI: 25.08-30.02 days). Complications within 30 days of surgery included 8 (1.10%) cases of renal failure, 8 (1.10%) urinary tract infections (UTIs), and 103 (14%) deaths. Meanwhile, 90-day complications included 23 (3.15%) cases of renal failure, 6 (0.82%) pulmonary embolisms, 22 (3.02%) UTI, and 113 (16%) deaths. This study highlights the impact of upper limb NF and provides crucial insights into its incidence, demographic correlations, and clinical outcomes, which can inform clinical management."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms, comprising less than 1 % of gastrointestinal tumors. Arising from interstitial cells of Cajal, GISTs are frequently found in the stomach and small intestine. Typically asymptomatic, GISTs can occasionally present as acute abdominal emergencies, including hemorrhage, obstruction, or perforation. This report presents a case of spontaneous perforation of a large ileal GIST, leading to peritonitis. An 82-year-old man arrived at the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination showed abdominal tenderness and distension, and laboratory findings indicated elevated inflammatory markers. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 15 cm mass in the lower right abdomen, with free fluid and extraluminal air suggesting perforation. Emergency laparotomy confirmed a perforated tumor, with purulent peritonitis. Surgical resection of the affected ileum and cecum was performed, followed by anastomosis and enterostomy. Histopathology confirmed a high-risk GIST, and the patient recovered well post-operatively, subsequently beginning adjuvant imatinib therapy. GISTs commonly remain asymptomatic until complications arise. Peritonitis due to tumor perforation is rare and necessitates prompt surgical intervention. Surgical resection remains the standard treatment for localized GISTs, with adjuvant imatinib recommended for high-risk cases. CT imaging is critical for diagnosis and surgical planning. While GIST perforation leading to peritonitis is rare, it requires urgent surgery. High-risk GIST patients benefit from adjuvant imatinib and should undergo long-term follow-up. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for complex GIST presentations and associated complications."

The Gastrografin protocol could be an effective tool in facilitating its evaluation and treatment. A prospective observational study was conducted on patients admitted to the emergency department with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction treated with the Gastrografin challenge to analyze risk factors related to the outcome. 55 patients were included. In 38 patients (69.09%) the resolution of the occlusive condition was obtained. The progression of Gastrografin in the colon at x-ray was correlated to the positive outcome (p = 0.001). Older (>75 years old) and frailer patients were related to protocol failure and submitted more to surgery (p = 0.043; p = 0.022). Air-fluid levels at x-ray was related to negative outcome (P = 0.027). Higher doses of Gastrografin (100 ml vs. 50 ml) seems unrelated to obstruction resolution. At the two-year follow-up, among the 38 patients who tested positive, 8 patients (21.05%) had further access to the emergency department due to intestinal obstruction and were re-treated conservatively. The standardized diagnostic-therapeutic protocol with Gastrografin is a valid tool in the non-operative management of small bowel obstructions offering a resolution of the obstructive condition in 70% of patients."

The patient had multiple comorbid conditions and risk factors for stercoral colitis that included a history of constipation, major depressive disorder, hypothyroidism, and a partial colonic resection due to an upper rectal perforation secondary to diverticulitis. With features of peritonitis on physical examination, historical, and computed tomography findings, the patient underwent urgent open abdominal exploration with colonic resection of the impacted bowel and end transverse colostomy. The patient had a complicated postoperative course owing to a respiratory infection and intraabdominal abscess formation but adequately recovered to be discharged home. Thus, urgent surgical intervention is necessary for survival in patients with stercoral ulceration, but modification of risk factors may be crucial in preventing stercoral colitis and its potentially fatal complications."

    "title": "Acute Compartment Syndrome in Congenital and Acquired Haemophilia.",
    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a surgical emergency defined as an increase in intramuscular pressure within a compartment that compromises capillary perfusion and threatens the survival of compartment tissues. A sustained increase in compartment pressure causes irreversible necrosis of nerves and muscles, leading to permanent damage. To conduct a narrative review of the literature on the diagnosis and treatment of ACS in persons with congenital and acquired haemophilia (PwH) METHODS: An English-language literature search for articles published before 28 February 2024 was performed in PubMed (MEDLINE) and the Cochrane Library using \"haemophilia and compartment syndrome\" as keywords. We found 77 articles in PubMed (of which 19 were eliminated as not strictly related to the topic) and 1 in the Cochrane Library (which was repeated in PubMed). In total, there are 83 published cases (61 of congenital haemophilia and 22 of acquired haemophilia). Misdiagnosis or failure to perform early haematological treatment in PwH suffering from ACS, followed by extensive fasciotomy if haematological treatment does not stop the problem, may result in permanent disability of the affected limb. The prognosis will depend on the intensity and duration of the compartment pressure elevation. For PwH, adequate clotting factor replacement should be the first step of treatment, as it may be effective in some cases of ACS. In general, factor levels of 50%-100% should be maintained in the perioperative period; thereafter, the dose can be gradually reduced to maintain levels at 50% for approximately 2 weeks or longer if necessary."

    "abstract": "Small intestinal diverticula are rare compared to colonic diverticula. Jejunal diverticulosis can occur in older men. These diverticula are usually asymptomatic but can present with acute abdomen when symptomatic. Complicated cases can present with perforation, peritonitis, and abscess formation. CT scan is the ideal imaging modality to diagnose perforated jejunal diverticulitis. Complicated cases warrant surgical intervention. A high clinical suspicion is necessary for the timely diagnosis of perforated diverticulitis. We are presenting a case of a 45-year-old who presented with an acute abdomen in a surgical emergency. Perforated jejunal diverticulitis was revealed as the cause of his symptoms during surgery. This case signifies the importance of varied clinical presentations of perforated jejunal diverticulitis and keeping it in the differentials of acute abdomen. Perforated diverticulitis has a high mortality rate, so timely management is of utmost importance."

    "abstract": "Acute Appendicitis, a surgical emergency, is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen. Its' immediate diagnosis and surgery are of immense significance for the disease itself and its surgery carries a potential risk of morbidity and mortality. The goal of this study was to find out the role of Neutrophils to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) in making a confident diagnosis of acute appendicitis in a facility limited setup. It is a cross-sectional validation study on 100 patients admitted to the surgical wards of Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad, with suspicion of Acute Appendicitis (AA), who subsequently underwent open appendectomy. Data were collected regarding the demography (name, age, gender) of the patient, physical examination, clinical presentations, and investigations including the complete blood count, from which the NLR value was calculated. Data was also collected regarding the histopathology examination of the appendix. The sensitivity was 70.65% while the specificity was 87.5% and accuracy was 72%. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) was 98.4% and NPV was 20.6%. There is a strong correlation between NLR value and Acute Appendicitis. According to the results of our study, NLR ≥ 2.5 seems to be a reliable parameter to obtain a more certain diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency. Laparoscopy has been increasingly used for the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO), but its indications remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the risk factors for conversion to open surgery after laparoscopic ASBO treatment and evaluate the impact of conversion on short-term outcomes. All patients diagnosed with ASBO who initially underwent laparoscopic approach after the failure of conservative treatment between December 2020 and May 2024 were reviewed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the surgical approach: the totally laparoscopic group (group 1) and the conversion to open surgery group (group 2). The demographic, clinical, and radiological features were compared, and risk factors were identified via univariate and multivariate analyses. The intraoperative findings and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. A total of 102 patients (43 in group 1 and 59 in group 2) were included. The time between home and admission (P ​= ​0.014) and the abdominal wall ratio (P ​< ​0.001) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1, whereas the number of prior abdominal surgeries (P ​= ​0.010) and the rate of beak signs were significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. The operative time (P ​< ​0.001), blood lost (P ​< ​0.001), medical expenses (P ​< ​0.001), total hospital length of stay (P ​< ​0.001), and postoperative hospital length of stay (P ​< ​0.001) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. Multivariate analysis revealed that a large abdominal wall ratio (odds ratio [OR]: 4538.7; 95 ​% confidence interval [CI]: 8.5-2426334.8; P ​= ​0.009) was a risk factor for conversion, whereas the presence of beak signs (OR: 0.186; 95 ​% CI: 0.05-0.64, P ​= ​0.008) was a significant protective factor. A large abdominal wall ratio is an independent risk factor for conversion, whereas the presence of beak signs is a protective factor. The conversion from laparoscopic surgery to open surgery is safe with proper management of conversion indications."

    "abstract": "Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare condition that arises due to various underlying conditions and comprises pentad back pain, saddle anesthesia, bowel bladder disorder, sensory and motor dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. The authors hereby present a case of CES in a 24 years old military person who was actively involved in exercise and heavy weight lifting. He was received at the emergency department with symptoms of low back pain with bladder and bowel incontinence, diagnosis of CES was made based on history, clinical examination, and radiological assessments. He was treated under expert surveillance. After the initial treatment he was admitted in the ward for almost a month due to intolerable low back pain. However currently he is showing good signs of recovery in 6 months follow-up. Early diagnosis of CES is likely to be beneficial as it helps delay deterioration, prevents further complications and improve the quality of life of patients but the diagnosis of this syndrome is usually delayed due to unavailability of diagnostic facilities in every health care center. So, assessment of this syndrome should be made among patient presenting with suggestive symptoms for timely diagnosis and better outcome. CES is a surgical emergency requiring early diagnosis and early intervention to prevent further complications."

If diagnosis and treatment are delayed or inappropriate, the consequences will be serious. Here, we report here a rare case of small bowel obstruction caused by enteroliths formed in the duodenal diverticulum. Conservative treatment was not effective. Six days later, the patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy to confirm small bowel obstruction, and enterotomy for lithotomy was performed. Obstruction of the small intestine due to passage of enteroliths from the duodenal diverticulum is rare. There is currently no definitive evidence delineating the optimal duration for non-surgical treatment.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous uterine perforation due to pyometra is a rare but serious condition. Pyometra refers to the accumulation of purulent material within the uterine cavity, typically resulting from an obstruction of the cervical canal combined with infection. When left untreated, the pressure from the accumulated fluid and the inflammatory response can lead to spontaneous uterine rupture. This condition often presents as an acute abdomen and can be life-threatening particularly in postmenopausal women. We present the case of a 71-year-old woman, para 8, who presented with acute abdomen characterized by generalized peritonitis. Diagnostic imaging revealed a fluid-filled, thickened endometrium with a complex pelvic collection. Emergency laparotomy revealed uterine fundal perforation with approximately 2 L of purulent material in the peritoneum. Subtotal hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo- Oophorectomy and extensive peritoneal lavage were performed. Cultures identified Citrobacter freundii, sensitive to multiple antibiotics, guiding effective postoperative treatment. Early surgical intervention is critical to prevent complications such as sepsis and multiorgan failure, which significantly contribute to the high morbidity and mortality rates of this condition. This case underscores the need for prompt recognition and aggressive management of pyometra-related uterine perforation in postmenopausal patients."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, and perforated appendix is one potential complication. Acute appendicitis can be complicated by perforation and peritonitis, but chronic abscess formation is less common. This report presents the case of a 45-year-old woman with a 7-day history of right lower-abdominal pain and swelling due to perforated acute appendicitis and abdominal wall abscess that required laparotomy and drainage. The presentation of this particular case is unique in that a fistulous tract formed subsequent to perforation of the appendix, with the resultant abscess forming in the abdominal wall. The current case study serves to showcase the diagnostic challenges associated with such a presentation. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of right lower-quadrant and midline lower-abdominal pain and swelling. Computed tomography (CT) scans with intravenous (IV) and rectal contrast showed an abdominal wall abscess with no signs of obstruction, perforation, or appendicitis. Incision and drainage of the abdominal wall abscess with debridement of the abdominal wall was complicated by peritoneal adhesions, and open laparotomy was thus performed. Upon entry into the abdominal cavity, the appendix was found to be adherent to the abdominal wall. It was noted that the appendix had perforated, allowing for fistula formation with the abdominal wall. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for perforated appendicitis in cases of abdominal wall abscesses with leukocytosis and right lower-quadrant pain, even when initial imaging does not show obvious appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Peritonitis is a surgical emergency arising mostly from the perforation or rupture of an abdominal hollow viscus. Surgical operations for peritonitis are often attended by high morbidity and sometimes mortality in severe cases. Surgical site infection (SSI) is perhaps the most common post-operative morbidity following laparotomy for peritonitis. To compare the rate of SSI in abdominal operations for peritonitis following wound irrigation with povidone iodine versus normal saline at a tertiary health institution in Nigeria. This was a prospective, comparative hospital-based study over a year. Consecutive consenting adult patients were randomised into two groups in this study. The first group (A) used 500 mL of 1% povidone iodine for subcutaneous wound irrigation, while the second group (B) used 500 mL of normal saline for subcutaneous wound irrigation. Wound irrigation was done after an appropriate surgical procedure had been carried out based on the pathology. Wounds were assessed for SSI for up to 30 days after operation using the definition criteria by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). SSI rates were compared between the two groups. Fifty-eight consecutive patients with generalised peritonitis over a one-year period were enrolled in this study, but 53 patients who completed the study were analysed. Thirty patients were males and 23 were females, and their mean age was 40.83 ± 17.96 years. Overall, 15 (28.3%) patients had incisional SSI. There were nine (34.6%) cases in the povidone group, while there were six (22.2%) in the saline group. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.32). Klebsiella species were the dominant organisms isolated from the infected wounds. Wound irrigation with povidone iodine after laparotomy for peritonitis did not reduce the rate and severity of surgical site infection more when compared to normal saline. We suggest further studies with a large number of patients in a multi-centre study to explore further the effect of povidone iodine versus normal saline wound irrigation on SSI following laparotomy for peritonitis."

However, appendicitis is not a common cause of intestinal obstruction, hence the challenge in making a diagnosis. Radiological and clinical diagnoses of this could be difficult; hence, diagnosis is mostly intraoperative. This case study involved a 54-year-old male, who presented at Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital with features of acute intestinal obstruction for 5 days. During surgery, a gangrene of a loop of the bowel was found with an inflamed and partly gangrenous appendix, forming a tourniquet around the loop of the bowel. Appendicectomy and resection of the gangrenous bowel were performed. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 12. We publish this case report to add to the existing literature. In addition, no such case has been reported in the subregion. Appendicitis is not common in the age group in our case study, which makes it different from other cases presented in literature."

The US News and World Report is an American media company that ranks colleges and hospitals based on annually published criteria. Hospitals that complied with the US News and World Report's (USNWR) Speed in Treating Testicular Torsion (SiTTT) metric saw improved surgical testicular salvage rates, but the metric's impact in mitigating inequities in testicular torsion is unstudied. A retrospective cohort study of patients 1-18 years of age presenting with testicular torsion was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System database. Hospitals were classified based on their SiTTT score at the metric's onset in 2015: they were labeled complete-scoring if they achieved the maximum score and partial-scoring otherwise. Surgical testicular salvage was defined as orchiopexy without concomitant orchiectomy. Testicular salvage rates were compared based on various socioeconomic variables including race between the pre-metric (2010-2015) and post-metric (2015-2019) periods with both univariate and adjusted, multivariate analyses. We identified 3950 cases of testicular torsion: 2335 in complete-scoring hospitals and 1615 in partial-scoring hospitals. Only partial-scoring hospitals improved significantly in salvage rate (pre-metric 61.0 % vs post-metric 67.5 %, p < 0.01). Subgroup analysis revealed the largest benefit in patients with economic or communicative barriers such as those with complex chronic conditions (pre-metric 35.3 % vs post-metric 61.1 %, p < 0.05). No minority races had statistically significant improvement after the metric, and salvage rate gap between White and all other races increased (pre-metric 4.3 % vs post-metric 10.0 %, p < 0.05). Patients with communicative or economic barriers showed improved equity after efforts to comply with a third-party metric, but disparities persisted for minority races.

    "abstract": "Gallbladder volvulus (GV) is a rare surgical emergency characterized by the twisting of the gallbladder around its mesentery, leading to vascular compromise and gangrene. It is often misdiagnosed as acute gangrenous cholecystitis due to overlapping symptoms, making preoperative diagnosis challenging. Definitive identification is typically made intraoperatively. Contributory factors include advanced age, female gender, low body mass index, and increased gallbladder mobility. Urgent surgical intervention is crucial to prevent severe complications such as perforation and biliary peritonitis. We report a case of an elderly woman with a low BMI who had a history of right hemicolectomy for locally advanced cecal cancer and ongoing immunotherapy for pelvic recurrence. She presented with acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting but no fever or jaundice. Examination revealed a tender upper abdomen with a palpable mass. Laboratory investigations showed leucocytosis with unremarkable CRP, liver, and renal function tests. A CT scan demonstrated a grossly distended midline gallbladder with a swirl sign at the cystic pedicle, consistent with GV. Supportive management was given, followed by urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, a gangrenous gallbladder twisted 360° twice around its mesentery was identified and safely removed without complications. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged within 48 hours. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of GV and highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion, particularly in elderly, frail patients with risk factors. Imaging findings such as the \"swirl sign\" and midline crossing of the gallbladder on CT scan aid preoperative diagnosis. Urgent surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of management, as delayed treatment can result in significant morbidity."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that can be challenging to diagnose due to its varied clinical presentations. Standard imaging methods include ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT), typically used for oncology, can incidentally detect appendicitis through increased radiotracer uptake associated with inflammation. The paper discusses two cases where acute appendicitis was identified during PET/CT scans conducted for cancer evaluations. In cancer patients, diagnosing appendicitis is difficult due to overlapping symptoms from chemotherapy, metastasis, or radiation effects. Clinicians and radiologists must remain vigilant for incidental appendicitis findings in PET/CT scans, as early diagnosis can prevent complications despite its rarity in oncology imaging."

Paraduodenal hernias represent the most common subset of all internal hernias (IHs). The symptoms are nonspecific and range from persistent abdominal discomfort to acute abdomen. An expert radiologist and a high index of suspicion of IH are required to diagnose timely and to prevent its fatal complications, such as bowel ischemia and infarction. An IH is a potentially fatal entity if misdiagnosed and not treated timely.

Cecal foreign body is a rare cause of cecal perforation. We report a 35-year-old male from China who initially exhibited symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis. However, during a minimally invasive colonoscopy procedure, the authors found that a wooden toothpick caused the perforation. The patient presented to our emergency department with a 2 days history of right lower abdominal pain and low grade fever. The patient was in good health and had eaten fish 2 days earlier. Physical examination revealed mild pain with positive rebound tenderness in the right lower abdomen. However, computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed a strip of high-density shadows protruding beyond the intestinal cavity outline, with a small amount of peritoneal seepage in the ileocecal area. Combined with the medical history, the possibility of foreign body perforation by a fishbone and peripheral peritonitis were considered. However, the high-density shadow was identified as a wooden toothpick, which was removed via a minimally invasive procedure using a foreign body forceps under colonoscopy. The patient's condition improved significantly within 5 days after treatment. We emphasize the importance of a detailed patient history, accurate diagnosis and proper treatment in patients with acute abdomen."

In this case, surgical intervention was required due to an associated cecal volvulus. While acute complications such as bowel strangulation are rare in hernias of this size, delayed presentation and the lack of timely surgical consultation permit significant inguinoscrotal hernia growth. Furthermore, underlying medical comorbidities in these patients may preclude the safe administration of general anesthesia, further hindering timely surgical repair. In developed countries, both trainees and consultants often have limited exposure to such cases, resulting in minimal experience managing the technical challenges involved. Key factors for successful surgical repair include addressing the loss of domain and managing extensive bilateral anatomical defects. This case report outlines the acute management of a cecal volvulus and the use of an open Rives-Stoppa repair, a technique commonly employed for recurrent, large, or complex inguinal and ventral hernias.

Quality of reporting was appraised using The Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model of Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. Fourteen studies were included in the final analysis of which ten were published after 2019. Two studies originated in the United States while half were carried out in Europe. Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest AI methods were the most commonly used modeling approaches. Commonly used predictors were pain and laboratory blood findings. The average area under the curve that was reported among the fourteen studies was greater than 80 %.

It is most common in the ileum, but can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. An adult case of intestinal duplication is accompanied by non-specific symptoms and, hence, it is often difficult to establish accurate diagnosis preoperatively in adults. We experienced two cases of ileal duplication that was manifested as acute abdomen. In both cases, we performed emergency surgery with a tentative preoperative diagnosis of perforation peritonitis related to intestinal duplication. The first case was a 36-year-old male presenting with a cystic non-communicating intestinal duplication, which was perforated, causing abdominal pain. The second case was a 77-year-old male presenting with tubular communicating intestinal duplication, in which a fecal stone was fitted into the root of the duplicated intestine, and the duplicated intestine itself became abscessed, causing abdominal pain. Their postoperative courses were uneventful and the patients were discharged from hospital without any sequelae on the 5th and 10th postoperative day, respectively. Although preoperative diagnosis is not easy, because the clinical presentation varies depending on the occurrence site, in-depth evaluation of preoperative CT images could lead to a precise diagnosis especially when considering intestinal duplication as one of the differential diagnoses of acute abdomen."

The records of 56 pediatric patients who underwent primary open-globe injury repair at our clinic between 2016 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Data about demographics, date-setting of the injury, type of the traumatizing object, injury size, and zone were collected. The initial and final best-corrected visual acuities (VAs), associated features, trauma-hospital admission, and hospital admission-surgery durations were also recorded. The Pediatric Penetrating Ocular Trauma Score (POTS) was calculated to evaluate its effect on the final VA. Fifty-six eyes of 56 patients with a median age of 8 years who were followed up for at least 6 months were included. The majority of the injuries took place at home (62.5%), while the most common traumatizing object was a knife (10.7%). The mean size of injury was 4.73±2.92 mm; of which 60.7% (34) cases were in zone 1, 33.9% (19) cases in zone 2, and 5.4% (3) cases in zone 3 injury according to Ocular Trauma Classification group. The mean VA of 1.48 ± 1.21 logMAR at presentation was improved to 0.83±1.13 logMAR at the last visit (p<0.001). The POTS was significantly correlated with the final VA (p=0.001; r=-0.473). Iris prolapse was observed in 31 patients (55.4%), whereas the lens was injured in 26 (46.4%) cases and displayed a significant influence on the post-operative visual outcome (p=0.019). The mean duration between trauma-hospital admission was 18.9±43.8 h; while hospital admission-surgery was 8.6±3.7 h. Our study demonstrated that the VA at presentation and the presence of lens injury are visual prognostic factors for pediatric open-globe injuries."

    "abstract": "Deep neck infection is a pathology at the border of two specialties, otorhinolaryngology and maxillofacial surgery, and represents a medico-surgical emergency. In terms of its evolution, it can extend to the level of the thorax and result in mediastinitis, with difficult evolution and poor prognosis. The aims of this scoping review are to present the etiology, bacteriology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostics, as well as treatment, in light of the research published in the last 5 years on deep neck infection associated with descending necrotizing mediastinitis. The most common primary sources of deep neck infection are odontogenic and tonsillar. The other sources that are involved in deep neck infection are salivary glands, foreign bodies, malignancies, and iatrogenic causes after endoscopic maneuvers. The bacteriologic aspect is polymorphic, including both aerobic and anaerobic species. Complications that may appear include jugular vein thrombosis, airway obstruction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Timely diagnosis is important for ensuring the positive evolution of a deep neck infection. A CT scan is important for characterizing the nature of a deep neck lesion and identifying the spaces involved, and this method represents the gold standard for diagnosis of these lesions. Following the establishment of a definitive diagnosis, antibiotic therapy is initiated empirically, and is modified according to bacteriological exam results. The administration of antibiotics is an essential part of the treatment strategy for patients with a deep neck infection. Based on CT results, different surgical methods are applied under general anesthesia. The surgical strategy involves opening and draining the cervical spaces and debriding the necrotic tissue. In the cases of odontogenic causes, drainage and extraction of the infected teeth are performed. It is especially important to follow up on the dynamic progression of the patient. In the management of a deep neck infection associated with descending necrotizing mediastinitis, a multidisciplinary team is necessary."

Once adnexal torsion is suspected in young women, gynecologists should perform surgery to release the torsion as promptly as possible to preserve future fertility. Herein, we report a case of acute appendicitis that was unexpectedly discovered during laparoscopic surgery initially performed for suspected torsion of a right ovarian teratoma. A 20-year-old nulligravid woman with a history of left ovarian teratoma resection and ulcerative colitis presented with left lower abdominal pain. Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no findings suggestive of exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, such as bowel wall thickening or worsening ascites, while a mass suspected to be an ovarian teratoma was identified. Gynecologists and an emergency physician specializing in gastroenterology who attended the patient suspected an acute abdomen caused by adnexal torsion or tumor leakage associated with a right ovarian teratoma 5 cm across. However, laparoscopy revealed that the right ovarian teratoma was neither twisted nor ruptured. Instead, the appendix was swollen with yellow turbid ascites, compatible with acute appendicitis. Therefore, laparoscopic excision of the right ovarian teratoma and appendix was performed, and the patient's pain resolved postoperatively. The assumption that the pain was caused by torsion of the right ovarian teratoma was the primary reason for failing to diagnose acute appendicitis. This underscores the importance of evaluating the appendix during gynecologic laparoscopic surgery performed for suspected ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen (WS) is exceedingly rare and is attributed to the absence or maldevelopment of the spleen's anchoring ligaments. The diagnosis of WS in the emergency department poses a particular clinical challenge as the clinical presentation is highly variable from acute abdomen requiring immediate surgery to chronic indolent pain extending over years. Herein, we report the case of a 34-year-old nulliparous lady, who presented to the emergency department with left iliac fossa pain associated with vomiting, successfully diagnosed preoperatively using computerized tomography. A splenectomy was performed, and the patient achieved full recovery. Timely use of imaging aids emergency physicians in the early detection of wandering spleen. Early diagnosis allows spleen-preserving strategies and therefore prevents the life-threatening complications of postsplenectomy sepsis."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction represents a critical surgical emergency with a myriad of potential causes, ranging from mechanical blockages to functional impairments. In contrast to developed nations, where the usual causes of obstruction are adhesions, strictures, and metabolic derangements, infective etiologies, like tuberculosis and parasitic infestations, are more common in developing countries. We present a case report of a 22-year-old man presenting with acute intestinal obstruction due to a massive ascariasis infestation. The patient exhibited classical symptoms of intestinal obstruction, including abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. Imaging studies revealed multiple air-fluid levels, suggesting a small bowel obstruction. Emergency surgical intervention was performed, and a substantial number of live worms were extracted from the small intestine, relieving the obstruction. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged with anthelmintic therapy and instructions for improved sanitation practices. This case underscores the importance of considering worm bezoars as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute intestinal obstruction, particularly in endemic regions, and highlights the significance of prompt surgical intervention for resolution. Additionally, it emphasizes the critical role of public health measures in preventing and managing parasitic infestations."

We present a rare case of CSD involving hematometra in a perimenopausal woman, which led to emergency hysterectomy. A 51-year-old woman with a history of CS presented with acute abdominal pain. Transvaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging identified a hematometra within a large CSD extending into the cervical myometrium. Emergent hysterectomy was performed due to persistent pain. Histopathology revealed a fresh hematoma within the CSD, with ectopic endometrial glands and hemorrhage on its walls. This case highlights the pathogenesis of hematometra within a CSD and underscores its potential to cause acute abdomen in perimenopausal women."

    "abstract": "Injuries make up a significant portion of the emergency surgical patient load in most hospitals, representing a major public health threat The burden of injury as a public health issue is especially pronounced in low- and middle-income countries, where injuries are responsible for up to 90% of mortality. Identifying common mechanisms of trauma and patterns of presentation can aid in identifying at-risk populations and in the development of targeted preventive protocols. From February 2000 to January 2015, a prospective observational study was conducted to examine the patterns of presentation and epidemiology of patients presenting to the surgical emergency department of a University Teaching Hospital. All patients who presented during these 15 years were enrolled in the study. A total of 27,588 patients were admitted through the surgical emergency department during the study period. Of these, 18,374 patients (66.6%) presented with trauma, while the remaining 33.4% sought care for other surgical emergencies. Trauma patients were generally younger, with an average age of 30.27 years, compared to an average age of 41.33 years for those presenting with other surgical emergencies. Road traffic crashes accounted for the majority of injuries (65.3%), followed by falls (8.9%) and assaults (6.9%). The majority of patients (69.2%) were transported to the hospital by friends and relatives. Injuries represent a substantial portion of the emergency surgical care demands in this setting. Road traffic injuries continue to be the predominant cause of trauma, with young adult males being the most frequent victims."

    "abstract": "Bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency worldwide. It may result into high morbidity or mortality whenever intervention is delayed. It affects all age groups. The most commonly seen etiologies of bowel obstruction are post-operative adhesions, neoplasm and hernia in that order. Intestinal knot syndrome is an extremely rare cause of intestinal obstruction, and when it occurs, it poses diagnostic challenges. We report a case of appendico-ileal knotting causing strangulated small bowel obstruction due to its rarity and diagnostic difficulty. Our objective is to discuss the clinical presentation and management of this rare cause of surgical emergency. A-72- year old man was seen at the emergency unit of our center with 4 days history of gradual onset of colicky abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. He had a two-day history of constipation and a one-day history of fever. He was acutely illlooking and his vital signs were abnormal. Urgent abdominopelvic ultrasound and plain abdominal x-ray was performed and were suggestive of intestinal obstruction. He had emergency laparotomy, and intra-operatively appendico-ileal knotting was seen with gangrenous appendix and terminal ileum. This necessitated limited right hemicolectomy and ileo-colonic anastomosis. The patient was managed post-operatively and discharged on post-operative day 10. Appendico-ileal knotting is a cause of small bowel obstruction although it is very rare. The diagnosis is commonly confirmed intra-operatively. There are reports of simple small bowel obstruction secondary to appendico-ileal knotting, but this case confirmed that it could also lead to strangulated intestinal obstruction."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. It is commonly encountered during surgical practice as the cause of the patient's presentation or as an incidental finding during other unrelated procedures. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of Meckel's diverticulum in our clinical practice and to provide an adequate level of knowledge of the clinical and diagnostic features and the management of Meckel's diverticulum. We analyzed the medical records of all cases who were diagnosed with Meckel's diverticulum at our hospital for over eight years. Age, sex, presentation, diagnostic procedures, surgical techniques, and histopathology were reviewed and analyzed. A total of 104 patients were enrolled in our study. Mean age was 28.8 years, with male predominance in 92 (88.5%) patients. Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum was detected in 80 (77%) patients and in 24 (23%) incidental findings. The most common emergency presentation was abdominal pain with 34 patients (42.5%), then intestinal obstruction with 20 patients (25%), bleeding per rectum with 12 patients (15%), acute abdomen with nine patients (11.3%), and intussusception with five patients (6.2%). Mean length of the Meckel's diverticulum was 4.3 centimeters. Small bowel resection was performed in 41 (45.1%) cases, stapled resection in 44 (48.3%), and ligated Meckel's base in 6 (6.4%). Ectopic gastric mucosa was the most common finding in histopathology in 30 (28.8%) patients. Our study supports that the longer Meckel's diverticulum is, the more prone it is to developing complications, and stapler resection and small bowel resection are considered safe techniques, as well as resection of incidental Meckel's diverticulum, which does not increase the risk of morbidity."

Timely intervention by experts is crucial to mitigating cumulative morbidity. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of bronchotomy as a secure alternative following unsuccessful attempts at bronchoscopic foreign body retrieval. A retrospective review of 21 instances involving bronchotomies and resections carried out following unsuccessful bronchoscopic foreign body extraction was conducted between June 2013 and March 2022. The posterolateral thoracotomy approach was employed for surgical interventions. A total of 21 cases underwent bronchotomy and resectional procedures, with a retrospective follow-up spanning 10 years. Patient ages ranged from 1 to 12 years, predominantly affecting the left lung. Bronchotomy was chosen as the intervention in 85% (18 cases) of instances. The incision was extended towards the foreign body in 8 cases involving the right bronchus and in 13 cases for the left bronchus. Late presenters commonly exhibit hemoptysis. Objects retrieved ranged from pen caps and whistles to metal balls. All enrolled cases underwent preoperative bronchoscopy. This study underscores the significance of rigid bronchoscopy as the diagnostic and primary intervention for foreign body aspirations in pediatric cases. Bronchotomy emerges as a secure and effective alternative. Retained foreign bodies causing endobronchial obstruction with stasis necessitate resection, while bronchotomy is a safe procedure for non-retrievable foreign bodies without structural changes.

This report presents a unique case of uterine perforation as a result of pyometra in a postmenopausal woman. A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical suspicion was initially directed toward acute appendicitis. However, imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum with multiple air pockets, suggesting intestinal perforation. Exploratory laparotomy uncovered no bowel perforation but revealed a 2x2 cm uterine fundal perforation with pus drainage. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed acute necrotizing inflammation extending into the myometrium, with no malignancy detected. Therefore, early diagnosis and surgical intervention, including hysterectomy, are critical for reducing the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Hence, this case underscores the importance of considering uterine perforation as a differential diagnosis in elderly postmenopausal women presenting with acute abdomen for which prompt surgical management is essential to ensure a favorable outcome."

    "abstract": "The acute abdomen is a life-threatening clinical entity that requires immediate diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment. 15-20% of emergency room patients with acute abdominal pain need interventional or surgical treatment. This narrative review is based on publications retrieved by a PubMed search, current textbooks and guidelines, and the authors' personal experience. The acute abdomen presents with the sudden onset of maximally intense abdominal pain, sometimes with guarding, and often with impaired general well-being, ranging to manifestations of shock. Its more common causes, aside from nonspecific abdominal pain (30-41%), are acute appendicitis (8-30%), cholecystitis (9-11%), and ileus (4-5%). The diagnosis is established by the history and physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and, in some cases, exploratory laparoscopy. The acute abdomen is generally a surgical condition, but it often requires interdisciplinary, multimodal treatment and follow-up. It carries a 2% to 12% mortality, with the figure rising for every elapsed hour until specific treatment is provided. Structured, quality-controlled, rapid, and targeted diagnosis and treatment markedly lower the morbidity and mortality of patients presenting with an acute abdomen."

Timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing serious morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis typically involves physical examination, laboratory tests, ultrasonography, and computed tomography (CT). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in analyzing CT images for the early diagnosis of AA and prevention of complications. Methods: CT images of patients who underwent surgery for AA at the General Surgery Clinic of Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Health Application and Research Center between January 1, 2019, and June 31, 2023, were analyzed. A total of 1200 CT images were evaluated using four different AI models. The model performance was assessed using a confusion matrix. Results: The median age of the patients was 28 years, with a similar sex distribution. No significant differences were observed in terms of age or sex (P = .168 and P = .881, respectively). Among the AI models, MobileNet v2 showed the highest accuracy (0.7908) and precision (0.8203), whereas Inception v3 had the highest F-score (0.7928). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, MobileNet v2 achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8767. Conclusion: AI's role in daily life is expanding. In the present study, the highest sensitivity and specificity were 77% and 86%, respectively. Supporting CT imaging with AI systems can enhance the accuracy of AA diagnoses."

    "abstract": "Acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) is a significant cause of acute abdominal pain, accounting for 90-95% of gallbladder inflammations caused by gallstones. Its clinical presentation ranges from nonspecific abdominal pain to septic conditions associated with an acute abdomen. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical in patient management, as delayed diagnosis or inadequate treatment can result in increased morbidity and life-threatening complications such as perforation or biliary peritonitis. This study aims to identify factors influencing the severity of ACC by analyzing the relationship between laboratory findings, radiological imaging, and pathology results in cases managed in the emergency department. This retrospective study was conducted at the emergency department of Etlik City Hospital, a tertiary care center. Patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis were included in the study, while those under 18 years of age and those with choledocholithiasis were excluded. Patients' radiological findings, laboratory parameters, and pathological results were analyzed. A total of 230 patients were included in the study. Patients with pericholecystic fluid exhibited significantly thicker gallbladder walls (p=0.002). A significant association was found between elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts and gallbladder wall thickness (p=0.035). However, no significant relationship was observed between liver function test results and gallbladder wall thickness. This study evaluated the diagnostic and management parameters utilized by clinicians in cases of acute calculous cholecystitis. The association between increased gallbladder wall thickness and pericholecystic fluid was highlighted as a key factor in diagnosis and follow-up. Although laboratory and imaging modalities provide supportive roles in diagnosis, their necessity may vary depending on the individual case. The study emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach that integrates clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings to optimize patient outcomes in the emergency department, avoid unnecessary interventions, and prevent delays in surgical treatment."

    "abstract": "Emergency surgical pathologies constitute a significant portion of general surgery practice. Small bowel obstructions are a common cause of surgical emergencies in general surgical practice. This study aimed to investigate the predictive role of the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index and Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value in determining the need for operative treatment in adhesive small bowel obstructions. These obstructions are significant in general surgery, yet clinicians lack consensus on treatment selection and clinical follow-up. This study also seeks to address controversial questions surrounding this topic. The study included patients with small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions during the postoperative period who were treated and followed up in our General Surgery Clinic. Patients' age, demographic information, and clinical data from January 2017 to January 2024 were retrospectively reviewed and recorded using the hospital information management system (HIMS) and patient records. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0. A total of 341 patients with postoperative adhesive small bowel obstruction were included in the study. The mean age was 59.6+-17.4 years (range: 18-93 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4: 1. The median duration of symptoms was 2 days (range: 1-30 days). Operative treatment was performed in 19.6% of cases. The most frequently used operative technique was explorative laparotomy and bridectomy (70.1%). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was required for 16.1% of patients, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 4.1%. The predictive roles of the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value (PIV), and other markers for operative treatment were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that SII (area under the curve [AUC]=0.601, p=0.009) and PIV (AUC=0.596, p=0.010) were determinants for operative treatment. SII and PIV values may assist in determining the need for operative treatment or non-operative follow-up in patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). By utilizing these markers, unnecessary operative interventions may be avoided. The management strategies for ASBO, a significant component of general surgical emergency practice, remain to be fully clarified. There are ongoing debates in the literature on this subject. We believe further studies with prospective, homogeneous, and broader populations should be conducted to address this issue."

    "abstract": "Constipation currently affects approximately 15% of the global population, and contemporary lifestyles are increasing its incidence every year. A significant number of individuals with constipation also experience ileus, a common surgical emergency known for its sudden onset and rapid progression. However, the intricate dynamics of the relationship between constipation and ileus are not well understood. This study aimed to elucidate the causal relationship and underlying mechanisms of constipation and ileus, thereby advancing our understanding of their interconnections. A bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed using the IEU OpenGWAS database. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were used as instrumental variables to determine the causative association between constipation and ileus. Additionally, we utilized eQTL datasets to identify pertinent genes, conducted gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses, and constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks via the GeneMANIA database to identify the possible molecular pathways involved. Bidirectional MR revealed a significantly elevated risk of ileus due to constipation (OR = 1.467, 95% CI = 1.217-1.770, P < .001). Our eQTL investigation revealed 6 genes that were co-expressed in both ailments. Enrichment analysis suggested potential roles of these genes in nucleic acid metabolism and ribosomal biosynthesis, with b-ureidopropionase 1 (UPB1) exhibiting the most pronounced enrichment. Furthermore, PPI network analysis highlighted several pivotal proteins and genes. The findings of this study indicate the existence of a causal nexus between constipation and ileus, underscoring the significant genetic susceptibility shared between these conditions. It has been postulated that constipation can perturb the incidence of ileus via biochemical pathways, including nucleic acid metabolism and ribosomal biosynthesis, with UPB1 possibly serving as a key molecular target. Our results elucidate the novel genetic basis of constipation and ileus and provide a foundation for future experimental studies and the development of customized preventive and therapeutic approaches."

Acute appendicitis and perforated acute appendicitis in the postpartum period are rare incidences. Fever and abdominal pain are very common symptoms in acute appendicitis. Here, we are presenting a case of postpartum acute perforated appendicitis. A 34-year-old female was admitted in the department of obstetrics and gynecology with abdominal pain and severe abdominal tenderness. The cervical os was dilated, so the patient was taken to the labor room where she delivered a very low birth weight baby at 22 weeks. After delivery, patient developed respiratory distress and there was a sudden deterioration in her condition. She was then shifted to the critical care unit. The case was managed and the patient's respiratory distress lessened but the abdominal pain and tenderness still persisted. Plain radiography was done and it showed \"gas under diaphragm.\" The CT scan also showed pneumoperitoneum and a decision was taken to perform an emergency laparotomy. On laparotomy, perforated appendicitis was found. Diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy and the early postpartum period is very confusing, but an early diagnosis is always important. In antenatal screening, an ultrasound of the whole abdomen should be mandated in 30+ years old pregnant women. Surgery is the recommended treatment in such cases."

However, in rare cases, fish bones can perforate the gastrointestinal tract, causing serious complications such as perforation, abscess formation, or fistula development, necessitating emergent surgical intervention. This case report describes a rare case of gastric perforation by a fish bone ingestion, complicated by perigastric and hepatic abscesses. The patient initially presented to a rural emergency department with acute abdominal pain, where limited imaging resources posed a diagnostic challenge. After repeated rural emergency department presentations, a definitive diagnosis was only established after the patient was transferred to a tertiary center and evaluated using computed tomography (CT) imaging. This helped to guide appropriate surgical management, and an emergency laparotomy was performed, which was followed by an uneventful recovery. We emphasize the critical role of CT imaging in diagnosing fish bone perforation, discuss common sites of perforation, and highlight the need to consider this pathology as a differential diagnosis in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain."

The stomach is seen completely herniated into the chest suggesting rotation along its long axis worrisome for organoaxial volvulus. Intraoperative findings were a strangulated stomach through the diaphragmatic defect and migration of the entire stomach into the chest, at which division of the diaphragm and retrieval of the stomach after extensive adhesiolysis were successfully performed. The stomach was reduced back to the abdomen but was completely black and gangrenous; thus, total gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were done, and the hiatus hernia was repaired with chest tube placement. Acute gastric volvulus after laparoscopic fundoplication is a surgical emergency that presents diagnostic challenges.

We retrospectively analyzed the patients with acute abdomen who had ICN, in terms of etiology, demographic findings, surgery, and prognosis to determine the best treatment approach. Methods: Seven patients with per-operative diagnosis of isolated cecal necrosis were included in the study. Age, gender, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory data, imaging modalities, time from symptoms to surgery, surgical procedure, hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The median age of the patients and the F/M ratio were 61 years and 2/5, respectively. The most common comorbidity was chronic renal failure, followed by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The median time from symptom onset to surgery was 1 day. The ileocolic anastomosis was performed in 4 patients and terminal ileostomy in three patients. The morbidity and mortality rates were 28.5% and 14.3%, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days. Conclusions: ICN should be suspected in elderly patients with comorbidities presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen. Computed tomography is an important diagnostic tool. Diagnostic laparoscopy is a good option for definitive diagnosis and end ileostomy is better than anastomosis in patients with bleeding tendency or hypotensive patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis, coronary artery disease, and in the presence of purulent peritonitis to reduce morbidity and mortality."

We treated a 49-year-old Japanese woman with a history of gravida (n=5), parity (n=3), and cesarean sections (n=2). After visiting a physician due to abdominal pain and vomiting, she was referred to our hospital based on suspicion of ovarian torsion. Emergency surgery at our hospital revealed that the patient's small intestine was contained within the defective hilar membrane, resulting in a uterine broad ligament hernia. With the cooperation of the intestinal surgeon, we performed a resection and anastomosis of the necrotic small intestine in the herniated area. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the 9th postoperative day. A uterine broad ligament hernia causes necrosis of the small intestine and can be life-threatening. Women with a history of surgery or delivery might be at higher risk for this hernia. The swollen small intestine at the hernia site is often mistakenly diagnosed as adnexal torsion. In this patient's case, we diagnosed the uterine broad ligament hernia with necrotic small intestine during the surgery. The prompt surgery enabled a good patient prognosis."

    "abstract": "Ileosigmoid knotting is the wrapping of an active component of either the ileum or the sigmoid colon over each other. It is an unusual cause of intestinal obstruction, accounting for 1-2% of cases of all mechanical obstruction in the majority published literatures. A viable knot is a unique phenomenon of this seldom cause of bowel obstruction. A sixteen-year-old female patient presents with a complaint of central abdominal distension and obstipation of 12-hour duration. Later, she also developed abdominal cramps and vomiting of ingested matter. Her vital signs were all in the normal range, and the abdominal examination was positive for a grossly distended abdomen with mild upper and central abdominal tenderness. The ileosigmoid knotting was clearly visible on the computed tomography. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a viable ileosigmoid knot was identified. Unknotting, derotation, and decompression of the sigmoid colon were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Ileosigmoid knotting is a rare, life-threatening cause of intestinal obstruction with rapid progression to intestinal vascular compromise and gangrene. It is a hyperactive segment of ileum that winds around the pedicle of the redundant sigmoid colon, resulting in a closed-loop obstruction. There are different classification schemes of ileosigmoid knotting depending on the active component of the knot and based on the viability of the bowel and physiology of the patient. Preoperative diagnosis of this condition is often challenging and usually confirmed intraoperative. A high index of suspicion and prompt surgical exploration are crucial for the best outcome of the patient. Despite being a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, ileosigmoid knotting poses a significant morbidity and mortality to the patient. Management of a patient with viable ileosigmoid knotting is controversial, as some scholars suggest non-resective options and others recommend resective treatment as a recurrence preventive measure."

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and acquired diaphragmatic hernia (ADH) are secondary to a weakness or opening in the diaphragm. Both are types of internal hernia. The abnormality can range from a minor defect in the posterior edge of the diaphragm to the entire loss of it. CDH usually leads to lung hypoplasia associated with pulmonary hypertension and immaturity, as well as cardiac dysfunction. In ADH, pathophysiology is secondary to herniation and its pressure effects. We report a series of two cases of spontaneous ADH (SADH). Spontaneous acquired rupture of the diaphragm can occur after exercise, coughing, labor (delivery), or even without any significant preceding event. It is uncertain if SADH is caused by a preexisting weak region in the diaphragm, a loss of muscle coordination during vigorous exertion, or both. It is a potentially fatal surgical emergency requiring a high index of clinical judgment in the appropriate clinical setting. SADH acts mechanically by compressing the lung. It is an infrequent entity. This case series and review concisely illustrate the genesis, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous diaphragmatic hernia."

    "abstract": "Acute Osteofascial Compartment Syndrome (AOCS) stands as a critical surgical emergency, often secondary to various diseases. Its clinical manifestation arises from increased pressure within the fascial compartment, resulting in diminished tissue perfusion and consequential ischemic damage. Presently, clinical diagnostics lack effective biological markers, and patients face a grim prognosis, experiencing muscle contractures, necrosis, amputations, renal failure, and even mortality. The primary treatment, fasciotomy, poses infection risks and potential nerve damage. Hence, there is an urgent need for research elucidating AOCS's pathogenic mechanism and exploring novel treatments. To address this, we established a rat model of AOCS, extracting toe flexor muscles from both experimental and control groups. Employing second-generation high-throughput sequencing, we obtained comprehensive mRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, and miRNA data. Comparative analysis of expression differences between AOCS and control groups, followed by in-depth examination, allowed us to unravel the intricacies of AOCS occurrence from a multi-omics perspective. Our research findings indicate that AOCS is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, primarily involving immune cells, especially neutrophils. In addition, genes associated with ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, are found to be upregulated in the rat model, with non-coding RNAs playing a role in regulatory interactions. These results suggest that neutrophils may undergo ferroptosis, thereby enhancing inflammation and immune responses in the fascial compartment, which promotes disease progression. Furthermore, these findings reveal the interactions between immune molecules and pathways in AOCS, which are significant for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous intraperitoneal rupture of hepatic hydatid cysts is a rare but serious complication that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality due to risks such as anaphylactic shock and secondary peritoneal hydatidosis. This report presents the case of a 59-year-old male farmer from a rural area of Tunisia who presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnostic imaging revealed a large hepatic cyst with free peritoneal fluid, indicating a ruptured hydatid cyst. Emergency surgery involved cyst evacuation, peritoneal lavage, and drainage. Postoperatively, the patient developed a transient biliary fistula but recovered well with albendazole therapy to prevent recurrence. Six months post-surgery, the patient remains asymptomatic. The case underscores the importance of considering hydatid disease in acute abdomen diagnoses in endemic regions and highlights the critical role of imaging and timely surgical intervention. The literature review indicates variability in the prevalence of cyst rupture and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach combining surgery and antiparasitic treatment for effective management and recurrence prevention."

However, ileal fecalomas represent an exceptionally rare etiology, with few cases reported in literature. This case study and literature review aim to highlight an unusual cause of small bowel obstruction, emphasizing the diagnostic challenges and management strategies. A 60-year-old Middle Eastern female patient from Syria with a 1-year history of chronic constipation presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, and an inability to pass feces. Diagnostic imaging confirmed small bowel obstruction, which was caused by a fecal mass proximal to the ileocecal junction. Surgical extraction successfully resolved the obstruction. This case underscores the importance of considering fecal impaction as a differential diagnosis in patients with chronic constipation and highlights the effectiveness of surgical intervention in resolving such obstructions. A comprehensive review of literature on unusual causes of small bowel obstruction, including imaging characteristics and management approaches, is also provided to enhance clinical awareness and improve patient outcomes."

It typically occurs following trauma or in elderly patients with a history of chronic constipation, rectal prolapse, prior abdominal surgeries, or multiple vaginal deliveries, which weaken the pelvic floor. While rectal and rectosigmoid perforations in patients with rectal prolapse are uncommon, the herniation of the small bowel through a perforation, resulting in evisceration per rectum, is an extremely rare presentation. Fewer than 100 cases of per rectal small bowel evisceration have been reported in the literature over the last 200 years, with the first case described in 1827. Among the published English literature, only 38 cases of nontraumatic rectal perforation with small bowel evisceration have been reported.

    "abstract": "Hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus larvae, leads to cystic echinococcosis, primarily affecting the liver and lungs. It is common in endemic regions like Argentina and East Africa, with incidences of over 50 cases per 100,000 people. A rare and life-threatening complication is the intraperitoneal rupture of a hydatid cyst. A 38-year-old female presented with epigastric pain followed by sudden-onset abdominal pain and hypotension. Lab results showed elevated white blood cell count with a high eosinophil. Ultrasonography (USG) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans showed a large, ruptured hydatid cyst of the liver. Emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured hydatid cyst at the anterosuperior aspect of the liver. The intracystic collection was aspirated, and the cyst cavity and peritoneal cavity were washed with 20 % warm hypertonic saline. Postoperatively, albendazole treatment was started. Follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, and 6 months showed no evidence of recurrence on radiological scans. Intraperitoneal rupture of hydatid cysts is a rare yet life-threatening complication, accounting for 1-16 % of cases. USG and Contrast-Enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen are the mainstays for diagnosis, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) helps detect cystobiliary communication. Treatment includes stabilization, surgical cyst evacuation, and scolicidal irrigation. Postoperative albendazole therapy, along with regular follow-up, is essential to prevent recurrence. Spontaneous rupture of hepatic hydatid cyst with cystobiliary communication is a rare but critical condition, especially in endemic areas, presenting with acute abdomen and shock. Lifesaving emergency laparotomy followed by comprehensive postoperative care is vital for preventing complications and recurrence."

    "abstract": "Acute cholecystitis is a common surgical emergency and a painful condition that often requires frequent intravenous opioid analgesia. Sometimes, pain control of patients with acute cholecystitis is challenging. In this case, we present a potential alternative to managing acute cholecystitis pain. A 40-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with right upper quadrant pain. While awaiting testing and ultrasound, she received multiple doses of opioid analgesia. A point-of-care ultrasound of the right upper quadrant was performed and demonstrated findings of acute cholecystitis. Given that her pain was challenging to manage, even with intravenous opioids, an ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane (ESP) nerve block was discussed and subsequently performed at the T7 level. Thirty minutes after the procedure, the patient reported significant relief of her pain and did not require any opioid analgesia until ten hours later on the inpatient floor. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: ESP nerve blocks can potentially offer an alternative analgesic in the management of acute cholecystitis, subsequently reducing the use of opioids in the ED. ESP nerve blocks can potentially offer patients longer-lasting analgesia. ESP nerve blocks can potentially manage visceral pain in the ED."

    "title": "Impact of seasonality and ambient temperature on testicular torsion incidence: A Mexican Nationwide population-based study.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency characterized by twisting the spermatic cord, disrupting blood flow, and causing severe pain and swelling. It predominantly affects males aged 12 to 18, with an incidence of about 3.8 per 100,000 in this age group. Immediate surgical intervention is vital, as irreversible damage can occur within 4-6 h of symptom onset. Recent studies have suggested a correlation between low ambient temperatures and an increased incidence of testicular torsion, particularly in colder months. This study aims to analyze the relationship between temperature variations, seasonal trends, and testicular torsion incidence in Mexico from 2014 to 2024. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a hospital admissions database from Mexico, covering December 2013 to July 2024. Patients diagnosed with testicular torsion (ICD-10 code N44X) aged 1 year or older were included, resulting in 3973 admissions after exclusions. ANOVA was used for seasonal difference analysis, and the Kruskal-Wallis U test was employed to examine climatic regions. Post-hoc comparisons utilized Tukey's test for monthly incidence. The Spearman rank test evaluated the correlation between mean monthly temperatures and incidence. A heatmap displayed monthly incidence by state. Significant seasonal variations in incidence rates were observed: averages were 0.07 ± 0.02 in winter, 0.05 ± 0.02 in spring, 0.04 ± 0.02 in summer, and 0.05 ± 0.02 in fall (p = 0.001). Seasonal fluctuations correlated significantly with ambient temperatures (p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis indicated that winter incidence was notably higher than in other seasons (p < 0.05). Monthly incidence rates were similar in temperate and tropical regions (p = 0.095) but higher than in the subtropical zone (p < 0.05). A moderate negative correlation between ambient temperature and monthly incidence was found, strongest in subtropical regions (R = -0.323, p = 0.000). The present work is the first to comprehensively examine the relationship between ambient temperature and testicular torsion incidence in Mexico, showing significant seasonal patterns. The findings align with previous research in Latin America, suggesting lower temperatures increase the risk of torsion. Public health initiatives are crucial to raising awareness and potentially improving early diagnosis and management strategies. A clear association between seasonal temperature fluctuations and testicular torsion incidence was observed, particularly during winter months in Mexico."

    "abstract": "Appendico-ileal knotting is an extremely rare complication of acute appendicitis resulting in small bowel obstruction (SBO) and potential strangulation. It accounts for a negligible fraction of SBO cases, with only a handful of cases reported globally in the literature. The condition arises when an inflamed or gangrenous appendix forms a knot around the ileum, often exacerbated by adhesions or anatomical variations, leading to closed-loop obstruction and, if untreated, bowel strangulation and gangrene. A 34-year-old female presented with four days of crampy mid-abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, and absence of bowel movements. Examination revealed generalized peritonitis, diffuse tenderness with guarding, and rigidity, accompanied by leukocytosis. An emergency laparotomy uncovered hemorrhagic fluid and an inflamed appendix wrapping around the distal ileum, causing a closed-loop obstruction with necrotic-appearing bowel. Following hemicolectomy, ileostomy, and appendectomy, the patient stabilized, was weaned off vasopressors, and recovered uneventfully. Discharged on postoperative day seven and followed up regularly, she eventually underwent ileostomy reversal three months later without complications. Acute appendicitis rarely leads to SBO through appendico-ileal knotting. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging due to its rarity and non-specific radiologic features. Surgical management varies from simple appendectomy to resection of gangrenous bowel, with decisions guided by intraoperative findings. High clinical suspicion, prompt recognition, and timely surgical intervention ensure better outcomes in appendico-ileal knotting."

Internal hernias represent a surgical emergency that requires prompt recognition due to the high risk of strangulation and ischaemia of affected bowel loops. The case of a transomental hernia (TOH) is described in a young girl. She re-presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain 3 weeks following a motor vehicle accident where she was a restrained passenger. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a closed loop small bowel obstruction with features of ischaemia, which was likely secondary to an internal hernia. Urgent surgical intervention revealed a TOH containing ischaemic but viable loops of small bowel. Laparoscopic reduction of the hernia was successful, and the patient made a good recovery."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Previous works on the epidemiology of pediatric trauma during the COVID-19 lockdown observed a decrease in pediatric surgical emergency consultations and fracture referrals. None of those works describes a unique situation in which there is the coexistence of another opposing factor, like an earthquake, that influences the number of injured children's referrals. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of earthquakes during the COVID-19 lockdown on pediatric injury pattern referrals at a tertiary care hospital in a urban setting. Methods: A retrospective single-center case-control study comprised a time interval at the time of the COVID-19 lockdown, starting with a day when the biggest earthquake happened and finishing at the end of the confinement period in Zagreb, Croatia (22 March-27 April 2020). The control group comprised the identical time interval in 2019. We identified all successive pediatric trauma patients referred to the Pediatric Emergency Department. Demographics and leading injury characteristics were analyzed. Results: We analyzed data from 1166 patients. In the case group, the median age was lower than in the control group but without gender differences. We detected a decrease in Pediatric Emergency Department referrals and a reduced proportion of pediatric trauma patients in the case group. Additionally, the proportion of shoulder/elbow injuries and head injuries was higher, and the proportion of foot/ankle injuries was lower in the case period than in the control period. Conclusions: Earthquakes during the COVID-19 lockdown changed the pattern of pediatric injuries. These data can be used to restructure health resources during similar conditions to provide optimal health care to children."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias are characterized by the protrusion of abdominal viscera through congenital or acquired apertures within the abdominal cavity and are a recognized etiology of intestinal obstruction. Internal hernias can cause symptoms ranging from mild abdominal discomfort to complete intestinal obstruction. Transomental hernias are often associated with postoperative anatomical changes and are rare in patients without prior abdominal surgeries. This report details one case of a 31-year-old otherwise healthy female with no history of prior surgery, highlighting the clinical variability associated with internal hernias.  The patient presented with severe epigastric pain and nausea, with initial ultrasound findings unremarkable. Hours later, she returned with left iliac fossa pain and vomiting. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast showed free fluid and dilated bowel loops, suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Emergency laparoscopy revealed small bowel herniation through a congenital omental band and ischemia, which resolved after the band was released. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on day three. Transomental herniation exhibits nonspecific clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Radiographic presentations are generally nonspecific; however, a conclusive diagnosis is typically reached during surgery, where the detection of gangrenous bowel tissue is common, especially during exploratory laparoscopy. The postoperative mortality is largely attributed to bowel necrosis and delays in initiating treatment. This emphasizes the significant risk posed by undiagnosed cases and the critical importance of timely and effective intervention."

A retrospectively database of geriatric emergency general surgery (EGS) patients who underwent emergency surgery was used for the development of the scoring system. In total, 1500 patients were enrolled with mean age of 69.8 years in the study. Through the development and comparison of models, we ultimately derived a rating scale known as GES (Geriatric Emergency Surgery Score). This score has a c-statistic of 0.892 for mortality (95% CI 0.854-0.931). The observed probability of mortality in hospital gradually increased from 1.1% at a score of 0 to 30.3% at a score of 5 and 100% at a score of 8. The GES scoring model in this study will accurately predict the mortality risk of elderly patients with acute abdomen, optimize the allocation of medical resources, and standardize the assessment of patients' conditions based on scientific criteria. Further prospective multicenter trials are needed to externally validate the model developed."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom among patients visiting the hospital. A wide range of differential diagnoses are associated with this presentation, some of which are more uncommon than others, and require a higher degree of clinical suspicion and radiological excellence to diagnose. Although clinicians rely on physical assessment, examining a patient who is agitated and non-cooperative sometimes limits the physical exam findings, making these diagnoses even more challenging. We present a case of a middle-aged male patient who had acute abdominal pain in the setting of polysubstance abuse as confirmed by a drug screen. His initial imaging was unremarkable for a cause and the patient was intubated. After intubation and sedation, his physical examination was benign. He was extubated the next day and complained of worsening abdominal pain. His physical exam then was concerning for an acute abdomen and upon review of the initial imaging, a missed diagnosis of internal hernia was established. The patient subsequently underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and a large section of the bowel was resected. This case highlights the importance of considering alternate diagnoses for common presentations and paying careful attention to classic radiology findings in these situations."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of an acute abdomen among pediatric patients. The diagnosis of appendicitis is challenging due to the nonspecific presentation. Diagnosis is based on historical, physical, and serologic information as well as right lower quadrant ultrasound (RLQ US). In equivocal patients, or those with a high degree of suspicion, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast can be utilized to rule in appendicitis. However, optimizing diagnostic protocols to minimize ionizing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic accuracy is important. We performed a monthly retrospective analysis of CT usage among pediatric patients with suspected acute appendicitis presenting to the pediatric emergency department (ED) from June 2023 to December 2023. We used quality improvement methodology to decrease CT use with monthly Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles with an aim to decrease CT use by 50%. The main intervention was coordination between the ED and surgical providers to require surgical consult before ordering a CT. We quantified the number of patients who received a surgical consult before CT, the number of RLQ US performed, the number of CTs performed, and the number of appendectomies, specifically the number with perforation. A total of 249 patients under 18 years of age presented to the pediatric ED with symptoms of acute appendicitis during the study period. All 249 patients underwent an initial RLQ US. The number of CTs performed decreased from a baseline of 14 in June to a nadir of four in September (71% decrease, p=0.029). There was a decrease in the percentage of patients who underwent a CT scan after an RLQ US from 36.5% in June to 11.8% in September after our intervention. In June, a total of 38 RLQ US were performed and 14 patients underwent additional CT (36.5%) and in September a total of 34 US were performed and 14 patients underwent additional CT (11.8%). There was an increase in the surgical consults rate from a baseline of seven surgical consults with 14 total CTs in June 2023 (50%) to seven consults with a total of seven CTs performed (100%) in December 2023. There was no increase in appendiceal perforation rates.

This study aims to build a prediction model of clinical-radiomics nomogram for early diagnosis of MAE based on non-contrast computed tomography (CT) and biomarkers. In this retrospective study, a total of 364 patients confirmed as MAE (n = 131) or non-MAE (n = 233) who were randomly divided into a training cohort (70%) and a validation cohort (30%). In the training cohort, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms were used to select optimal radiomics features from non-contrast CT images for calculating Radscore which was utilized to establish the radiomics model. Logistic regression analysis was performed to screen clinical factors, and then generate the clinical model. A predictive nomogram model was built using Radscore and the selected clinical risk factors, which was evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Thirteen radiomics features were chosen to calculate Radscore. Age, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatine kinase (CK) and D-dimer were determined as the independent clinical factors. The clinical-radiomics nomogram model showed the best performance in training cohort. The nomogram model was with higher area under curve (AUC) value of 0.93, compared to radiomics model with AUC value of 0.90 or clinical model with AUC value of 0.78 in the validation cohort. The calibration curve showed that nomogram model achieved a good fit in both cohorts (P  = 0.59 and 0.92, respectively). The DCA indicated that nomogram model was significantly favorable for clinical usefulness of MAE diagnosis. The nomogram provides an effective tool for the early diagnosis of MAE, which may play a crucial role in shortening the time for therapeutic decision-making, thereby reducing the risk of intestinal necrosis and death."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis in pregnancy is the most common non-obstetric surgical condition which requires urgent evaluation and immediate intervention in a multidisciplinary approach. Pregnancy anatomical and physiological changes can mask the presentation of appendicitis and poses both diagnostic and management challenges. A 32 year old female, G3P2L2 at gestation age of 11 weeks by USS, presented with recurrent episodes of acute abdominal pain for one day, afebrile but accompanied with poor appetite, nausea and vomiting along episodes of per vaginal spotting which started three days prior. She was initially diagnosed and treated as a threatened abortion case with no improvement of symptoms. Abdominal pain was refractory to analgesics. Abdominal pelvic USS was done twice and revealed no features of appendicitis while obstetric USS was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed an Alvarado score of 7. A diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed acute perforated appendicitis and she underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with uneventful post-operative recovery. Acute appendicitis is challenging to diagnose and manage during pregnancy due to symptoms overlapping with maternal physiological and anatomical changes along with obstetric presentations like threatened abortion. Appendicitis scoring systems like the Alvarado score are still reliable diagnostic tools even during pregnancy while the use of preferred imaging like USS is more limited secondary to gravid uterus. All pregnant women with acute abdomen pain and suspecting features of acute appendicitis should be screened thoroughly for the condition. Diagnostic laparoscopy is useful and friendly in diagnosis and management in pregnancy. Multidisciplinary approach in evaluating and managing such cases in pregnancy is of high clinical benefits for maternal-fetal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus (GSI) is a rare complication of gallstone disease. It occurs as a result of the passage of a stone from the biliary tract into the gastrointestinal tract via an abnormal pathway (bilio-enteric fistula). Chronic inflammatory processes result in gall bladder adhering and subsequently eroding into the intestines, leading to a fistula. It is a surgical emergency seen in the elderly who often present as being unwell, with abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. Imaging such as a CT scan is diagnostic in confirming small bowel obstruction. Management usually involves relief of obstruction by removing the impacted gallstone. Despite surgical intervention, a small proportion of patients develop recurrent symptoms or recurrent gallstone ileus, usually within a few weeks of initial presentation. The recurrence of symptoms during index admission is extremely rare and can be challenging to diagnose and manage. The morbidity and mortality remain high in elderly patients. We report an 89-year-old patient who presented with small bowel obstruction. The CT scan confirmed gallstone ileus as a result of a stone impacted in the mid-small bowel. The patient had a laparotomy with extraction of the stone. No migrating stones were felt proximally. Five days postoperatively, he developed recurrent gallstone ileus confirmed on a CT scan and had to undergo another surgery to relieve the obstruction. We aim to investigate various management strategies for recurrent gallstone ileus, ranging from the commonly practiced approach of simple stone extraction to more definitive surgical interventions, including fistula repair, which may provide a more comprehensive solution."

A prospective study of 14 patients with extreme beak calcaneal fracture (Type 2 Lee's - tuberosity avulsion fractures) treated with CC screw fixation was conducted in VMMCH, Karaikal, Puducherry between June 2022 and June 2023. Patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months. Functional outcomes were assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot scale. The mean AOFAS score at the final follow-up was 89.3 (range 78-98). Radiographic union was achieved in all cases by 20 weeks with a mean union time of 13.09 weeks in closed fractures and 18 weeks in open fractures. One patient developed a superficial wound infection without any alarming signs of hardware issues, which resolved eventually. No hardware failures or need for revision surgeries were observed. Early intervention with CC screw fixation appears to be an effective and safe technique for the treatment of extreme beak calcaneal fracture (Type 2 Lee's - tuberosity avulsion fractures), resulting in excellent functional outcomes and a low complication rate."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Despite its low incidence, complete postoperative abdominal evisceration represents a complication requiring an urgent solution. We aimed to present a rare case of an abdominal evisceration of the omentum and small-bowel loops after a total abdominal hysterectomy and review the literature regarding this condition's diagnosis and therapeutic management. Case report: On the sixth postoperative day for a uterine fibroid, a 68-year-old patient presented with an abdominal evisceration of the omentum and small bowel that occurred two hours before. An emergency laparotomy was performed to correct the evisceration and restore the integrity of the abdominal wall structure. The literature review was carried out in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases using the terms \"abdominal wall dehiscence\", \"abdominal evisceration\", \"open abdomen\", \"burst abdomen\", \"abdominal fascial dehiscence\", \"abdominal dehiscence post-hysterectomy\", and \"hysterectomy complications\" by identifying all-time articles published in English. Results: Seven studies were included in this electronic search. The early diagnosis of abdominal evisceration, the identification of risk factors and comorbidities, followed by the choice of surgical technique, and postoperative follow-up were parts of the standard algorithm for managing this life-threatening case. Conclusions: Abdominal evisceration, as a surgical emergency, requires the diagnosis and treatment of this complication alongside the identification of the risk factors that can lead to its occurrence, as well as careful postoperative monitoring adapted to each case."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The aim is to bring attention to the existence of a rare type of trauma of the hand, high-pressure injection injury, that appears to be minor with negligible signs and symptoms within the first hours after the accident, but in reality, produces significant tissue destruction with severe consequences. Recognizing this type of trauma by medical personnel, understanding the mechanisms involved, and knowing the etiological and prognostic factors can lead to early treatment initiation and avoid severe mutilating sequelae. Methods: A retrospective study on 16 patients diagnosed with high-pressure injection injuries, including water, air, paint, paint mixed paint with thinner, petroleum jelly, and lime (washable paint containing calcium oxide). The patients' epidemiological data, the time from accident to diagnosis, reasons for delayed diagnosis, treatments applied, and outcomes were recorded and evaluated. Results: All injuries occurred at the workplace due to negligence. Oil-based paint was implicated in 31.25% of cases. The most frequently affected anatomical region was the volar surface of the distal phalanx of the nondominant hand index finger. In one case, delayed presentation to medical care and diagnosis resulted in a compartment syndrome, requiring amputation. Conclusions: It is crucial to recognize and understand this type of trauma, as it constitutes an emergency due to its rapid progression. Delayed diagnosis can result in massive tissue destruction, potentially leading to the loss of limb segments and debilitating functional sequelae, which may severely impact a patient's socio-professional life."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the value of contrast-enhanced CT in diagnosing ultrasonography-unspecified adnexal torsion (AT). Surgically confirmed patients with painful pelvic masses (n = 165) were retrospectively collected from two institutes. Two senior radiologists independently reviewed the CT images and determined the Hounsfield unit difference between non-contrast vs portal venous phases (ΔHUPV-NC) in both derivation and validation samples. The cutoff value, sensitivity, specificity, predictivity, and reproducibility of the ΔHUPV-NC and other visually assessed CT signs were analyzed and compared using the receiver-operating characteristic curve, multivariable regression, and inter-rater agreement assays, respectively. Women with twisted (n = 73 [47 ± 19 years]) or untwisted (n = 92 [40 ± 15 years]) adnexal lesions were reviewed. The ΔHUPV-NC ≤ 17.5 HU (AUC: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.96]; sensitivity: 95% [95% CI: 87, 98]; and specificity: 88% [95% CI: 80, 94]) was the independent predictor of AT (OR: 137 [95% CI: 39, 481], p < 0.001). After training in ΔHUPV-NC measurement, the agreement between two junior residents and the consensus increased from fair (resident-1: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.41]; resident-2: 0.24 [95% CI: 0.1, 0.39]) to substantial (resident-1: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.65, 0.85]; resident-2: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.62, 0.83]). The post-training diagnostic accuracy (both residents: 81% [95% CI: 74, 87]) was higher than the pre-training accuracy (resident-1: 67% [95% CI: 59, 74], p = 0.007; resident-2: 66% [95% CI: 58, 73], p = 0.002). The sign of ΔHUPV-NC ≤ 17.5 HU in contrast-enhanced CT can be used to predict the ultrasonography-unspecified AT. The decreased attenuation difference between non-contrast vs portal venous phases, a quantitative measurement-based CT sign, highlights the value of using contrast-enhanced CT as a second-line imaging approach after an equivocal ultrasonographic examination to diagnose AT in emergency settings. The value of contrast-enhanced CT in diagnosing ultrasonography-unspecified AT is underestimated. The ΔHUPV-NC ≤ 17.5 HU is the only predictor to diagnose the ultrasonography-unspecified AT. Contrast-enhanced CT can be used as a second-line imaging approach after an equivocal ultrasonographic examination."

    "abstract": "Background: Childhood extranodal B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are often caused by Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Treatment usually involves intensive polychemotherapy, and recent prospective trials show significantly improved outcomes. Surgery primarily involves conducting biopsies; ablative interventions are not recommended. However, in cases of severe presentation, such as an acute abdomen, emergency surgery may be necessary. Methods: We present the case of a 17-year-old boy who underwent emergency surgery due to intestinal obstruction caused by a tumor mass. An exploratory laparoscopy was performed due to abdominal wall infiltrates, and a large intraabdominal mass was discovered in the ileocaecal region. The tumor and tumor infiltrates were successfully removed en bloc in a minimally invasive laparoscopy-assisted fashion. Results: The postoperative course was favorable, and chemotherapy was started. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of BL. Follow-up examinations, including a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, showed no tumor recurrence. More than two years later, the patient remains asymptomatic with negative PET scans. Conclusions: Laparoscopy-assisted removal can be useful for pediatric solid abdominal tumors with abdominal wall infiltrates that cause obstruction. Surgeons must assess indications and procedures based on imaging and findings during emergency interventions. The role of ablative MIS in pediatric BL is limited."

    "abstract": "Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is often difficult for skull base surgeons to address. FD arises due to the abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts, ultimately resulting in immature osseous tissue replacing normal cancellous bone. When the skull base is involved, it can result in cranial nerve compression. FD affecting the optic canal and optic nerve is the most concerning as new onset of vision loss is considered a surgical emergency. The prevalence of FD is approximately 3.6 per 1,000,000. The most severe implications of this disease are neurological deficits due to cranial nerve compression, cosmetic appearance, and high recurrence rates even in the setting of surgical and medical therapy interventions. A PubMed search of \"pediatric fibrous dysplasia management\" using MESH Terms was conducted. Articles were excluded for non-English languages, inaccessibility, and events/erratum/letters to the editor. Included articles were in English, as well as encompassed pediatric FD case reports or comprehensive reviews of FD that discussed pediatric presentations. A total of 109 articles were reviewed, and 44 were included in the final review. Most articles were case reports. There is a clear need for guidelines regarding surgical intervention, especially in the pediatric population, where hormonal fluctuation can influence rates of recurrence and bony deformity. Overall, most surgeons recommend close observation with biomarkers and radiographic imaging for asymptomatic patients until at least the age of 16 years old. Conservative methods, such as RANK-L inhibitors, can be utilized to decrease growth with some success, especially in older adolescents. This review is an update on this disease and its presentations, imaging findings, and treatment options. The current literature lacks clear guidance on management, especially in regard to surgical intervention or recurrence monitoring algorithms."

    "title": "Mean Platelet Volume as an Emerging Biomarker for Diagnosing Acute Appendicitis: A Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that requires a timely and accurate diagnosis to prevent complications. Several laboratory markers have been assessed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of acute appendicitis, including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and cytokines like interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. One less commonly used but potentially valuable marker is the mean platelet volume (MPV), which indicates the size of circulating platelets and has the potential to serve as a biomarker for inflammatory conditions. Methodology The study was designed as a retrospective analytical investigation to examine the role of MPV in diagnosing acute appendicitis. The retrospective design allowed the utilization of existing hospital data, ensuring that sufficient cases of acute appendicitis could be assessed without additional data collection. The calculation was based on statistical parameters, including the standard deviations from previous studies, critical values at a 5% significance level, and an 80% test power, arriving at a minimum required sample size of approximately 100 to ensure adequate statistical power for meaningful conclusions. Results The study found that patients with acute appendicitis had significantly higher MPV compared to the normal reference value of 8.9 fL. The average MPV in the patient group was 10.25 fL, which was statistically higher than the reference value (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the study revealed that MPV levels were even higher in patients with more severe forms of appendicitis, such as perforated or gangrenous appendicitis. The average MPV for the inflamed appendicitis group was 10.13 fL, while the average MPV for the perforated or gangrenous group was 11.26 fL, a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). Conclusions The study demonstrates that MPV is a potentially valuable marker for diagnosing acute appendicitis and assessing its severity, particularly when used in combination with other biomarkers like neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and WBC count.  Elevated MPV in complicated cases of appendicitis, such as perforated or gangrenous appendicitis, suggests that MPV may aid in identifying high-risk patients who require urgent surgical intervention.  While MPV alone may not be as reliable as NLR in predicting appendicitis severity, its inclusion in a multi-biomarker approach could improve clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal trauma causing intraperitoneal injury and/or bleeding can be life-threatening, requiring immediate intervention. Diagnosing these cases can be challenging, especially when pre-existing conditions are involved. Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) is a rare tumor of the appendix that can lead to pseudomyxoma peritonei. Herein, we present a case of ruptured LAMN following blunt abdominal trauma after a high-energy head-on collision, complicating the differentiation from other intraperitoneal injuries. A 42-year-old Japanese female was brought to our hospital following high-energy head-on collision. She presented with stable vital signs, complaining of anterior chest pain and abdominal tenderness without peritoneal irritation. Computed tomography scans indicated multiple fractures in her chest and complex fluid around the Douglas fossa extending to the ileocecal area, with a slightly dilated appendix tip. Despite stable vitals, emergency laparotomy was needed for suspected peritonitis and/or intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Emergency laparotomy revealed yellowish, jelly-like ascites and a ruptured appendiceal tumor. LAMN was suspected, and the appendix was completely resected, with cytoreductive surgery carefully performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of LAMN. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on Day 13 and referred for further LAMN management. This case report highlights the diagnostic difficulties of LAMN rupture following blunt abdominal trauma, stressing the need to consider rare conditions like LAMN in differential diagnoses of acute abdomen posttrauma."

While luminal obstruction due to fecaliths and lymphoid hyperplasia is a common cause, parasitic infections are a rare but significant contributor. Enterobius vermicularis, the most common helminthic infection in developed countries, can trigger appendiceal inflammation through a mechanical obstruction or immune response. This report presents a case of a 16-year-old male with acute appendicitis secondary to E. vermicularis infestation. The patient presented with typical appendicitis symptoms, and laparoscopic appendectomy revealed the parasitic involvement, confirmed by histopathology. Postoperative recovery was uneventful following surgical intervention and anti-helminthic treatment. E. vermicularis is often an incidental finding in appendectomy specimens but may play a pathogenic role in some cases of appendicitis.

    "abstract": "Introduction Acute cholecystitis, commonly caused by gallstones, is a prevalent surgical emergency worldwide. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard for treatment, but the timing is crucial, with early surgery (within seven days) reducing complications. Identifying prognostic factors such as age, sex, white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and gallbladder wall thickness can help predict outcomes and reduce the need for conversion to open surgery. Methods A prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted at Sree Balaji Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, on 60 patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. The inclusion criteria involved clinical signs (right upper abdominal tenderness, temperature >37.5°C, WBC >10,000 cells/mm³) and ultrasound findings (gallstones, thickened gallbladder, sonographic Murphy's sign). Data on prognostic factors (WBC, CRP, ultrasound, intraoperative findings) were collected and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.0 (Released 2021; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States), with chi-squared tests to evaluate associations between these factors and surgical outcomes. Results Patients aged 18-30 had the highest success rate for early LC, with only 10.5% converting to open surgery, whereas older patients (>50 years) had a higher conversion rate (33.3%). A higher body mass index (BMI) (>30) was linked to increased conversions (26.3%), as was the presence of hypertension (23.1%) and diabetes (22.2%). Elevated WBC and CRP levels were significant predictors of conversion (24.2% and 22.2%, respectively). Intraoperative factors such as gallbladder wall thickening (>4 mm) and pericholecystic fluid were associated with conversion rates of 20.8% and 25%, respectively. Converted cases had longer operative times and extended recovery periods. The predictive model for conversion showed a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 90%. Conclusion Key prognostic factors influencing the success of early LC include age, BMI, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers such as WBC and CRP. Younger patients had higher success rates, whereas older and obese patients were at greater risk of conversion. Preoperative optimization and early surgical intervention are critical for reducing conversion rates and improving outcomes. The predictive model's accuracy provides clinicians with a valuable tool for surgical planning."

This report describes a case of splenic infarction caused by thrombus detachment due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which was successfully treated and discharged from the hospital. A 52-year-old woman walked into the emergency room with left upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting 12 h prior. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the left upper abdomen, with no palpable mass, rebound tenderness, or guard stiffness. Initial treatment included fasting and analgesia, as well as relevant auxiliary examinations. Intravenous contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed splenic branch artery obstruction with a large splenic infarction, and further examination with 24-h dynamic electrocardiogram monitoring revealed rapid atrial fibrillation. Five days after admission, because there was no significant improvement in her abdominal pain after fasting, fluid replacement, analgesia, etc., she was finally given a laparotomy with total splenectomy. In general, most surgeons do not advocate surgical intervention for splenic infarction, as infarction can lead to autologous splenectomy, and the spleen gradually becomes fibrotic, atrophies, and eventually disappears. However, for patients whose atrial fibrillation episodes continue to increase and whose conservative treatment is still ineffective, surgery provides a more favorable treatment method. This case report highlights that in patients with splenic infarction due to cardiac thrombosis and unrelieved abdominal pain, splenectomy can be considered if cardiac function is stable and tolerable and if the ASA anesthetic is below class V."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in the pediatric population, affecting over 70,000 children per year in the United States alone. While historically practitioners predominately used computed tomography (CT) as the main diagnostic imaging modality, multiple professional societies have released guidelines recommending an ultrasound (US) first strategy when using imaging to confirm suspected appendicitis in pediatric populations. To date, no studies have quantified the change in imaging trends for pediatric appendicitis across the spectrum of healthcare facilities in the United States utilizing the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). We aimed to evaluate the imaging trends for pediatric appendicitis across the nation, stratified by age and gender. Specifically, we wanted to delineate the use of CT alone versus US alone or US first imaging strategies. This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized data from the NEDS spanning from 2006 through 2020. We examined and analyzed the total number of patients, the number of patients with available imaging data, sex, age, and included imaging modalities utilizing descriptive statistics and regression analyses. Similarly, regression analysis was employed to discern differences in imaging rates in time intervals following societal imaging recommendations. From 2006 to 2020 the database recorded 160,828 encounters for pediatric appendicitis. Imaging data was available for 101,248 encounters, accounting for 63% of the total sample. Over the study period, both rates of \"US only\" and \"US first\" imaging modalities increased (from 5.5% to 38.9% and 8.9% to 55.6%, respectively), while rates of CT utilization in isolation declined (from 91.1% to 44%). While there is an increasing trend towards US being used as the first imaging modality to diagnose pediatric appendicitis across the spectrum of facilities included in the NEDS, continued utilization of CT to diagnose appendicitis remains unacceptably high in the pediatric population within the limits of this retrospective study."

Diseases of the biliary system are among the serious local complications of acute pancreatitis, primarily including acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) and biliary stricture. AAC often occurs in the later stages of acute pancreatitis, exacerbating systemic inflammation and leading to organ failure and life-threatening conditions in severe cases. Biliary stricture is a rare but serious long-term complication of acute pancreatitis, which can induce cholangitis, progressive liver function impairment, and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Due to the clinical symptoms of acute pancreatitis that can mask biliary system diseases, some patients may not receive timely diagnosis and treatment for concurrent biliary issues during the onset of acute pancreatitis, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. Currently, the ideal treatment strategy for biliary system complications secondary to acute pancreatitis remains unclear, lacking definitive guidelines or consensus. This article integrates recent research developments from both domestic and international studies to elucidate the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for biliary system complications secondary to acute pancreatitis. 急性胰腺炎是外科常见的急腹症，其发展过程中往往伴随着严重的局部或全身并发症。胆道系统疾病是急性胰腺炎严重的局部并发症之一，主要包括急性非结石性胆囊炎和胆管狭窄。急性非结石性胆囊炎常发生在急性胰腺炎的病程后期，会加重患者全身炎症反应，严重时可导致器官功能衰竭等，危及生命。胆管狭窄是急性胰腺炎少见的远期严重并发症，可诱发胆管炎、进行性肝功能损害和继发性胆汁性肝硬化等严重并发症。由于急性胰腺炎的临床症状可掩盖其他症状，部分发病期间并发胆道系统疾病的患者未能得到及时诊治，严重时可危及患者生命。目前，针对急性胰腺炎继发胆道系统并发症的理想治疗策略尚不明确，缺乏具有指导意义的指南或共识。本文结合近年来国内外相关研究进展，对急性胰腺炎并发胆道系统疾病的发病机制、诊断及治疗策略进行阐述。."

This study aimed to evaluate whether implementing the acute care surgery (ACS) system in Korea has improved the clinical outcomes of patients. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at three tertiary hospitals in Korea. The study included patients aged 18-99 years who required EGS due to acute abdomen or abdominal trauma. A window period of 4 months was set after the implementation of the ACS system, and the clinical outcomes before and after the implementation were compared. A total of 2146 patients were enrolled in the study, with 1008 in the pre-ACS group and 1138 in the post-ACS group. After propensity score matching, 901 patients were selected in the pre-ACS group and 906 patients were selected in the post-ACS group. The time from emergency room admission to operating room transfer was reduced in the post-ACS group, with a mean of 452.2 ± 347.0 min compared to 522.1 ± 416.5 min in the pre ACS group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the complication rates were reduced in the post-ACS group (38.3% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.006). The implementation of the ACS system can lead to faster surgical decision-making and the prompt execution of emergency surgery for patients, thereby reducing postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children, yet it poses diagnostic challenges in preschool children due to atypical presentation. This case-control study aims to evaluate the distinct characteristics of acute appendicitis in preschool compared to school-aged children. Children under 5 years and a control group of children aged 5-10 years, operated on due to acute appendicitis at our institution during 2009-2022 were included. Data on demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory results, imaging, surgical procedure, pathology, bacteriology, antibiotic treatment, length of stay and outcomes were collected retrospectively. A total of 184 preschool and 187 school-aged children were included. Preschool children presented less frequently with abdominal pain but more often with vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. Preschool children had lower rates of leucocytosis but higher thrombocytosis and C reactive protein. Younger patients were more likely to undergo both chest and abdominal X-rays and be admitted to a paediatric department before diagnosing appendicitis. Complicated appendicitis, requiring increased use of intra-operative drain placement, and conversions to open procedures were more common in preschool children, with higher rates of ICU admission and surgical complications. Polymicrobial positive cultures and positive cultures for Bacteroides were more common in preschool children. This study highlights the critical need for increased awareness among healthcare providers regarding the diagnostic challenges posed by atypical presentations of acute appendicitis in preschool children. Despite comprehensive evaluation, diagnosis in this age group may be difficult, emphasising the significance of recognising these presentation patterns to improve diagnostic accuracy and prompt management."

    "abstract": "Gastric perforation secondary to barotrauma is a rare surgical condition which may manifest as an acute abdomen and potentially lead to complications such as pneumoperitoneum. A 50-year-old, healthy, experienced diving instructor was transported to our emergency department for an acute abdomen and severe dyspnoea after a diving incident. Clinical suspicion combined with computed tomography scanning lead to the diagnosis of linear rupture of the stomach. Exsufflation of the abdominal cavity was performed in the emergency department and then the patient was sent to the operating room for emergency laparoscopic gastric repair. Post-operative management was focused on decompressing the stomach with a nasogastric tube and abdominal radiography with barium ingestion was performed to confirm the absence of leakage. The patient was discharged at postoperative day four. We found 16 similar cases in the published literature. Gastric perforation secondary to a diving accident is rare but requires rapid diagnosis and surgical treatment."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis are among the commonest pathologies in acute general surgery. They are characterized by distinct symptoms, clinical examination findings and typical elements of the history which direct further investigations. In the absence of these classic findings, these diagnoses can be missed, particularly where they occur synchronously. Here we present the interesting case of a 63-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain and vomiting with no classical appendicitis or cholecystitis findings who was found to have both appendicitis with a 3 cm collection and gangrenous cholecystitis, managed with urgent laparoscopic appendicectomy and cholecystectomy. This patient had a background of Type 2 Diabetes which may have reduced awareness of symptoms. Given the increasing prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes and the risk of rapid deterioration in these patients, this case demonstrates the importance of prompt assessment of the entire abdomen when these patients present with acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen is a relatively rare condition and may be complicated by intestinal obstruction or abnormal intestinal rotation. Herein, we report a case where these three conditions appeared concomitantly. An 18-year-old woman with an intellectual disability was admitted to the hospital because of vomiting and fever. The patient's abdomen was distended. Computed tomography revealed a dilated small intestine, a swollen spleen located in the lower abdomen, as well as twisting and swirling of the splenic artery and vein. The patient was diagnosed with torsion of the wandering spleen and emergency surgery was performed. The vascular pedicle was found to be rotated 900° clockwise, and a markedly enlarged spleen was observed in the lower abdomen. When the splenic torsion was released, the pulsation of the splenic artery was well palpated, suggesting that the spleen could be preserved. Additionally, the sigmoid colon to the cecum was not fixed to the retroperitoneum. Dilatation of the small intestine was observed, but there were no findings of intestinal tract necrosis. Splenic torsion is part of the differential diagnosis for acute abdomen. Familiarity with embryology and anatomy is necessary to select the appropriate surgical technique."

The patient had experienced intermittent tenderness in the right iliac fossa for the last two months, which had worsened to severe pain over the previous two days, accompanied by a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an obstructed right Spigelian hernia containing dilated proximal small bowel, and a left uncomplicated spigelian hernia. The patient experienced worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. Emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing a right Spigelian hernia with viable small bowel loops, a non-complicated Meckel's diverticulum located 20 cm from the ileocecal valve, and a small left Spigelian hernia. The right Spigelian hernia was repaired using intraperitoneal sublay mesh, while the left hernia was treated with primary repair. No bowel resection was performed at the site of the Meckel's diverticulum, as it was non-inflamed, to prevent contamination of the mesh with bowel flora. Bilateral Spigelian hernias accompanied by Meckel's diverticulum present a challenging clinical scenario. Although rare, this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain due to the potential for serious complications."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis with an appendicolith is one of the most common abdominal emergencies in elderly patients and is more likely to progress to gangrene and perforation. To analyze the clinical data of elderly patients undergoing emergency appendectomy for acute appendicitis, aiming to improve treatment strategies. The clinical data of 122 patients over 80 years old who underwent emergency appendectomy for acute appendicitis at the Department of Emergency Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University from January 2016 to March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of an appendicolith or not, and clinicopathological and surgery-related features were compared between the two groups. The duration of abdominal pain in all 122 patients ranged from 5 to 168 h. All patients underwent emergency appendectomy: 6 had an open appendectomy, 101 had a laparoscopic appendectomy, and 15 required conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery, resulting in a conversion rate of 12.9% (15/116). The patients were divided into two groups: Appendicolith group (n = 46) and non-appendicolith group (n = 76). Comparisons of clinicopathological features revealed that patients with appendicoliths were more likely to develop appendiceal gangrene (84.8% vs 64.5%, P = 0.010) and perforation (67.4% vs 48.7%, P = 0.044), and had a lower surgical conversion rate (2.2% vs 19.7%, P = 0.013). The median length of hospital stay was 5.0 d for both groups and there was no significant difference between them. All patients were successfully discharged. Around 40% of patients over 80 years old with acute appendicitis have an appendicolith, increasing their risk of developing appendiceal gangrene and perforation, and therefore should receive timely surgical treatment."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdomen. It is important to differentiate between complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis before surgery in the emergency department. Recently, immature granulocytes have become one of the biomarkers used as predictors of inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine whether immature granulocyte levels are a biomarker that can predict whether acute appendicitis is complicated or not in patients admitted to the emergency department. Patients aged 18 years and older who presented to the emergency department between May 1, 2023, and April 30, 2024, and were diagnosed with appendicitis were included in the study. Patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of acute appendicitis were divided into two groups: acute simple appendicitis (n=149) and acute complicated appendicitis (n=103). Demographic characteristics, imaging results, and laboratory results were recorded. White blood cell, neutrophil count and percentage, lymphocyte count and percentage, immature granulocyte count and percentage, direct bilirubin, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin values were found to be significantly higher in the complicated appendicitis group than in the uncomplicated group (p-values; 0.001, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, 0.001, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, <0.001, 0.016, <0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The immature granulocyte percentage was 92% specific for the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis at a cut-off value of 0.6. The immature granulocyte percentage may be useful as a predictive biomarker in the diagnosis of complicated acute appendicitis with a specificity of 92%. Additionally, the immature granulocyte percentage has a higher discrimination power than the immature granulocyte count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin."

Given that it can lead to partial or total evisceration, bowel strangulation, sepsis, and acute mesenteric ischemia. Any instance of this complication should be treated as a surgical emergency. In this context, we report a case of a vaginal stump following regular use of pessaries. A 50-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of bowel-like prolapse from the vagina. She had a 7-year history of vaginal prolapse and had previously undergone repair surgery and laparoscopic hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. Following her hysterectomy, she began using a pessary due to recurrent prolapse. Clinical assessment revealed vaginal evisceration of the intestines, necessitating emergency surgery. She was discharged smoothly on the eighth day post-operation. Three months later, she underwent a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. The utilization of pessaries may heighten the risk of stump rupture in patients following hysterectomy, thereby demanding more vigilant attention from gynecologists."

This three-year retrospective study reviewed adult patients with IO treated at Mogadishu Somalia Turkey Training and Research Hospital from June 1, 2019, to June 1, 2022. Of the patients studied, 67% were male, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. The most common symptoms were nausea and vomiting (93.2%), abdominal distension (90.2%), and inability to pass stool or gas (70.8%). Surgical management was required for 95.1% of patients, with only 4.9% managed conservatively. The most frequent postoperative complication was surgical site infection. Hospital stays for 52% of patients ranged from 8 to 14 days. The overall mortality rate was 4.9%. IO remains a critical surgical emergency worldwide, requiring urgent intervention. Aggressive treatment of hernias and timely surgical intervention for mechanical obstruction are essential to reduce complications and mortality. Delayed presentations contribute to higher mortality rates. Small bowel obstruction was more frequent than large bowel obstruction, with fibrous adhesions and incarcerated hernias as the leading causes. Adhesiolysis and bowel resection with anastomosis were the most common surgical procedures. Further research using prospective study designs is recommended to improve understanding and outcomes."

The implications for loss of quality of life through delayed management are high, though no clinical symptom is pathognomonic in its diagnosis. We describe how machine learning based algorithms can be used in triaging patients with suspected CES (CES-S). Data of 499 patients who underwent MRI scan for CES-S was collected for demographics, red flag symptoms and radiological outcome. The dataset was used to train the machine learning algorithm in predicting MRI-derived diagnosis of CES. In the testing phase output predictions and Confidence of Prediction (CoP) were recorded for each case and further analysed. Of 499 patients, 12 (2.4%) had positive radiological outcomes for CES. Patients were divided into two subgroups based on their CoP: high (< 0.9) and low (< 0.9). High CoP was observed in 482 (96.6%) cases. In this group all predictions were correct: 476 negative and 6 positives. Low CoP was observed in 17 (3.4%) cases, of which 6 predictions were incorrect - false negatives. Performing MRI scans only in cases with high CoP positive predictions and all low CoP cases would reduce scans to 5% of the original number. With our dataset, the trained algorithm demonstrated the potential for safely reducing the number of emergency MRI scans by over 95%. Prior to the wide clinical application, large volume prospective data is needed for continuous training of the algorithm, in order to improve accuracy and confidence of prediction."

    "abstract": "Isolated injury to the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) caused by blunt abdominal trauma is rare but often lethal, especially in pediatric patients. Due to the low incidence of SMV injuries, there are no universal guidelines for its diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis is made using either computed tomography (CT) or intraoperative exploration. Primary vascular repair is recommended. A 10-year-old girl was transferred to a trauma center after a high-energy motor vehicle collision. Under the diagnosis of acute abdomen with hemoperitoneum, the patient underwent urgent laparotomy, 34 min after admission to the hospital. A complete laceration of the SMV trunk was observed. Definitive vascular repair of the transected SMV was performed. An interposition graft from the internal jugular vein was used with a good postoperative course. This case report demonstrates that definitive vascular repair of the SMV reduces the risk of intestinal ischemia and should be performed in cases where ligation presents a real threat to small bowel viability. In cases of severe SMV injury, the internal jugular vein is a high-quality and easily accessible graft."

In children, caecal volvulus can be associated with a variety of predisposing factors such as chronic constipation, intestinal malrotation, or neurological disease. Case Representation: We present a rare case of caecal volvulus, internal hernia, and an intestinal rotational abnormality in a previously healthy 8-year-old boy. The patient presented with a history of abdominal pain and vomiting for 3 days and was admitted to the hospital in a severe septic shock. After the initial stabilisation with fluids and vasopressors, an emergency laparotomy was performed. A necrotic caecum volvulus, a transmesocolic hernia, and an abnormal rotation of the small intestine were diagnosed. The necrotic bowel segment was resected in a right-sided hemicolectomy, after which a resection distal to medial colic artery was cut-off to achieve normal anatomy. The patient was discharged on the 12th postoperative day in good health and has since returned to normal active life without any health issues within the follow-up of 5 months. Conclusions: Caecal volvulus and internal hernia can lead to a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgical treatment. Rare causes of abdominal pain in children should be kept in mind when severe symptoms are present."

    "abstract": "High-pressure injection injuries of the hand occur after contact with the nozzle of a high-pressure injecting system such as a paint gun or air compressor, usually on the non-dominant hand of industrial laborers. The severity and real extent of damage in high-pressure injection injuries are often hidden behind a small punctiform wound at initial presentation and are generally underestimated. High-pressure injected material spreads into the tendon sheath, along neurovascular bundles and fascial planes, resulting in neurovascular compromise and acute compartment syndrome. Some products are extremely cytotoxic and can lead to chemical damage and tissue necrosis, with the potential for secondary infection. We present three cases admitted to our department requiring urgent evaluation and treatment. All cases had a distinct mechanism of injury and different materials injected; nevertheless, all had a similar clinical presentation. Symptoms included severe pain, swelling, tenderness, a punctiform wound, and hypoesthesia of the fingers, consistent with acute compartment syndrome, which constitutes a surgical emergency. The first case involves a 49-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after an accidental injection of graphite lubricant oil into the palm of his right hand. The second case is a 57-year-old man who sustained a high-pressure injury from an injection of an industrial car wash product in the thenar region of his right hand. The third case is a 37-year-old man who presented after an accidental high-pressure injection of an industrial anti-corrosive primer into the left palm at the metacarpophalangeal level of the index finger. The three patients underwent immediate surgical exploration for the decompression of the thenar and mid-palmar compartments, copious saline irrigation, and wide debridement of the foreign material and devitalized tissues plus carpal tunnel release. This approach in combination with antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis has achieved satisfactory results with significant clinical improvement and early discharge without neurovascular compromise. Prompt diagnosis, early surgical intervention, and postoperative intensive physiotherapy are essential for hand salvage and function restoration in this type of injury."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency whereby the ovary twists, or torts, on its ligamentous support and potentially compromises vascular supply to both the ovary and Fallopian tube. It accounts for 2-3% of all acute gynecological emergencies, yet is a condition that is rarely reported to occur after hysterectomy. While it is well established that ovarian torsion can occur after laparoscopic hysterectomy, we report on the rare occurrence of ovarian torsion occurring post the supposedly preventative ovarian transposition suspension procedure or ovariopexy. This highlights that further evaluation of laparoscopic surgical techniques are required to prevent this exquisitely painful gynecological condition occurring postoperatively. We report two cases of ovarian torsion post-primary laparoscopic radical hysterectomy performed for cervical malignancy. Both patients were Caucasian, multiparous, premenopausal female patients, aged 37 and 39 years old. Ovarian transposition suspension was performed at the primary procedure to allow ovarian function to be preserved if the patient's required postoperative pelvic irradiation if surgically upstaged. Both patients underwent emergency laparoscopic detorsion, with one torsion due to reoccurrence of her cervical cancer. Adnexal torsion is estimated to occur between 1% and 8% in post-hysterectomy cases. It can be a difficult to diagnose condition, with prudent history-taking, relevant investigations, and a low threshold to consider laparoscopy forming essential clinical acumen. Unfortunately, the suspension of the ovaries post-hysterectomy does not exclude future ovarian torsion. With rising rates of cervical cancer in premenopausal women, reportedly increasing by 37% in the 25-34 age range in the United Kingdom (National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England. 2021), further research is needed to improve techniques to allow for safe ovarian conservation for these patients while undergoing operative treatment of cervical cancer."

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen, also known as ectopic spleen, is an uncommon disorder in which the spleen's anatomical location differs from its fixed position in the abdomen's left upper quadrant. The etiology is either congenital or acquired, possibly leading to torsion and splenic infarction. It affects children and young adults, especially childbearing-age women. Patients affected by this condition may present with nonspecific symptoms requiring a high index of suspicion. Given the nonspecific clinical symptoms and the potential complications associated with wandering spleen, computed tomography scans provide a crucial means for proper diagnosis. A 38-year-old female patient presented with worsening abdominal pain of one-week duration. The pain was more localized to the left hemi abdomen but later she claimed that it became diffuse. She had associated vomiting of ingested matter and loss of appetite. She had a similar complaint of abdominal pain for the last year. Up on examination, she looked acutely sick. Abdominal examination showed a flat abdomen moved with respiration; a big intra-abdominal mass was tender; it was freely mobile in all directions; with no sign of fluid collection. A CT scan of the abdomen suggested an ectopic spleen with splenic torsion. Intraoperative findings revealed an infarcted wandering spleen. An emergency splenectomy was performed. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day and had an uneventful postoperative recovery. If a normal spleen is not identified in the left upper quadrant, a search for ectopic splenic tissue should ensue. If the patient has not had a prior surgical splenectomy, some possible explanations include an ectopic or \"wandering\" spleen. This case was an infarcted wandering spleen caused by abnormal ligamentous attachments. Wandering spleen with torsion poses a great diagnostic challenge for acute abdomen due to the rarity of its occurrence and non-specific presentations. A high index of suspicion is the key to early diagnosis and timely intervention is required to improve treatment outcomes."

This retrospective, single-center study enrolled patients with cancer admitted to the ICU before or after emergency surgery between November 2020 and September 2023. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations between patient characteristics in the open and closed ICUs and in-hospital mortality. Among the 100 patients (open ICU, 49; closed ICU, 51), 23 died during hospitalization. The closed ICU group had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, and preoperative lactate levels and a shorter duration from diagnosis to ICU admission, surgery, and antibiotic administration than the open ICU group. Univariate analysis linked in-hospital mortality and APACHE II score, postoperative lactate levels, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and mechanical ventilation. Multivariate analysis revealed that in-hospital mortality rate increased with CRRT use and was lower in the closed ICU. Compared to an open ICU, a closed ICU was an independent factor in reducing in-hospital mortality through prompt and appropriate treatment."

    "abstract": "Microcystic stromal tumors (MCST) are rare sex cord-stromal tumors with distinctive microcystic features and stromal tumor immunophenotypes. Few reports have discussed MCST from the perspective of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this report, we describe the MRI findings of MCST, review our case, and discuss it based on previous reports. A 24-year-old female with a history of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) presented to the emergency department with complaints of lower abdominal pain. A plain abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a huge ovarian tumor measuring 19 cm. MRI revealed an isointense ovarian tumor on T1-weighted images and a heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated enhancement confined to the capsular structures. Based on the tumor size and MRI findings, malignancy could not be definitively excluded. However, considering the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of tumor infection was made, and an open adnexectomy was subsequently performed. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of MCST, and the patient's condition progressed without apparent recurrence one year after surgery. In previous reports, MCST has been associated with FAP, and almost all cases were benign. Patients diagnosed with FAP can reduce the risk of acute abdominal pain by using less invasive treatments, as long as they keep up with regular checkups and screenings."

    "abstract": "Introduction Patient consent for surgery is a vital part of the surgical pathway from both a patient safety and medicolegal point of view. Improvement in documenting the full consent process in the electronic patient record (EPR), alongside the standard completion of the paper consent form in a surgical emergency unit (SEU), to comply with the Montgomery ruling of informed consent, has become of paramount importance. The aim of this project was to improve the documentation of the full consent process by creating an electronic template that was easy for the consenting clinician to use and provided a robust record of the bespoke consent process for the individual patient. Methods In July 2020, clinicians in the SEU were asked to begin documenting the patient's consent process in the EPR. The number of documented electronic consent processes (ECPs) of patients who underwent emergency general surgery during a two-week period was then captured between October and November 2020. The second cycle involved creating a single consent template, allowing the ECP to be easily documented in one template for all the common emergency surgery operations. All clinicians who were responsible for surgical consenting were asked to use the electronic template as part of the consent process. The rate of electronic consent was recorded over a second two-week period, six months later, in May 2021. Results From the first cycle, 78 patients were identified as undergoing emergency surgery, of which 13% (N=10) had an electronic entry regarding the consent process fully documented and personalised to the patient. From the second cycle, 64 patients were identified. The rate of documented ECPs increased to 77% (N=49). Conclusion This project has successfully improved the electronic demonstration of a consent process, bespoke to the individual, in accordance with the Montgomery ruling, by implementing an easy-to-use template on EPR. This is a significant step towards full digital consent in the future."

    "title": "Perioperative severity of acute appendicitis during the confinement related to SARS COVID-19: a retrospective comparative cohort.",
    "abstract": "To evaluate the perioperative severity of acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019 in the Nancy-Metz region, France. Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that can lead to severe complications if not treated promptly. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns resulted in reduced hospital visits, potentially delaying treatment for appendicitis and increasing perioperative severity. This retrospective, bicentric cohort study included 634 adult patients who underwent emergency appendectomy at the Nancy University Hospital and Metz Regional Hospital. The study compared patients from the pandemic period (March 17, 2020, to December 14, 2020) with those from the same periods in 2018 and 2019. The primary outcome was perioperative severity, defined by a Gomes score ≥ 3 and/or a Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ 3. Secondary outcomes included time to treatment, severity of biological inflammatory syndrome, postoperative complications, and hospitalization metrics. Logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustments for ASA scores. The study included 194 patients from the COVID-19 cohort and 440 from the non-COVID cohort. The perioperative severity was higher during the COVID period (33.5% vs. 25.9%), though this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0845). Secondary outcomes such as time to treatment, severity of the inflammatory syndrome, and postoperative complications did not show significant differences between cohorts. However, the duration of postoperative antibiotic therapy was longer during the COVID period (6 days vs. 5 days, p = 0.0410). The COVID-19 pandemic led to a non-significant increase in perioperative severity of acute appendicitis. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the French healthcare system maintained effective management of surgical emergencies, with no significant increase in postoperative complications. Further research is required to explore the broader impact of the pandemic on the management of appendicitis."

    "title": "Chronic appendicitis; the overlooked cause of chronic abdominal pain: Case report.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a surgical emergency and the diagnosis is straightforward in majority of the cases. However, chronic appendicitis, a relatively rare cause of chronic abdominal pain, presents a unique challenge due to its atypical presentation. This rarity underscores the need for vigilance and thoroughness in our practice to avoid misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. We present a case of chronic appendicitis in which a 30-year-old male patient presented with a nine-month history of chronic abdominal pain with mild right lower quadrant tenderness. Abdominal ultrasound suggested a feature of appendicitis, and the patient underwent appendectomy; finally, the diagnosis was confirmed on the histopathologic exam. Chronic appendicitis, a relatively rare condition, is often diagnosed late due to a lack of well-developed diagnostic criteria and atypical presentation. However, using abdominal U/S and CT scan imaging plays a crucial role in assessing chronic appendicitis, highlighting the importance of these tools in our practice. In many cases, the ultimate diagnosis is confirmed after a histopathology exam, reinforcing the need for a comprehensive approach to diagnosis. Chronic appendicitis can have an atypical presentation with milder symptoms, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Abdominal U/S is an important imaging modality in assessing suspect cases of chronic appendicitis."

    "title": "What matters in testicular torsion? Association of hospital transfer, race and socioeconomic factors with testicular outcomes in a single center experience.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that is managed with either septopexy-only or tunica vaginalis flap with septopexy if the testis is potentially viable or orchiectomy if not. Minimizing time from ischemia onset to surgery maximizes the likelihood of testicular preservation. While factors such as time from door to OR can be easily targeted, others such as inequalities in access to care are more difficult to address. We sought to determine whether patient transfer affects testicular outcomes intraoperatively and in the long-term. Secondary goals included investigating the impact of race and Child Opportunity Index (COI) on testicular torsion outcomes and defining the optimal time cutoff from symptom onset to presentation that predicts salvage. We reviewed our prospective testicular torsion database to identify boys who underwent operative intervention for testicular torsion between January 2015 and March 2022. The association of race and COI with testicular salvage, defined as septopexy-only, was evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression controlling for time to presentation, while the association of transfer with salvage was evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regression controlling for age, time to presentation, and time to OR. To determine the optimal cutoff for time to presentation to predict testicular salvage, the Youden index was calculated. Race and COI were not associated with testicular salvage on either univariate or multivariate logistic regression that controlled for time to presentation. Transfer status was not associated with salvage, while age, time from symptoms to presentation, and time from institutional arrival to OR were associated with salvage. The optimal time cutoff to predict salvage using the Youden index was 10.5 hours from symptom onset to presentation and 14.5 hours from symptom onset to detorsion. Time to presentation was the strongest, modifiable risk factor associated with testicular salvage. As it may be difficult for children to accurately communicate their symptoms, diagnosis and prompt management of testicular torsion can be delayed. Improvement in outcomes can be achieved by placing greater efforts into patient, parental, and primary care provider education of the signs and symptoms of testicular torsion. Race, COI, and transfer status were not found to have a statistically significant effect on testicular salvage outcomes in patients presenting with testicular torsion. Despite the common premise of a 6-hour window until testicular loss, we found that intervention within the acute window of 14.5 hours from symptom onset is still associated with salvage."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency leads to severe acute ischemia injuries, and may eventually cause male infertility. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domaincontaining 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in testicular torsion pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of nanocurcumin (nCur) on testicular tissue and the NLRP3 inflammasome components. In this experimental study, male Wistar rats (n=36) were randomly divided into six equal groups: controls, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), I/R+nCur (50 or 100 mg/kg thirty minutes before reperfusion), and I/ R+nCur (50 or 100 mg/kg thirty minutes before reperfusion and continued for seven days). The left testis was rotated 720 (2×360) degrees counterclockwise to induce testicular torsion. After two hours of ischemia, detorsion was performed. At the end of treatment, an orchiectomy was carried out. The testis histopathology and the mRNA levels of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and Caspase-1 were evaluated. Our results revealed that, testicular I/R had a detrimental effect on testis histology such as the number of spermatogonia (14.5 ± 0.57, P<0.001) and the seminiferous tubules epithelium thickness (28.5 ± 11.7, P=0.007). It also significantly increased the expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome components (P<0.001). Treatment with nCur (in both doses) improved testicular damage and significantly reduced the expression of NLRP3 (P=0.007), ASC (P=0.003), and Caspase-1 (P<0.001). These results imply that nCur might be a useful therapeutic strategy in the field of reproductive medicine to diminish the side effects of testicular I/R via its anti-inflammatory properties and may be employed as adjuvant therapy to lessen testicular torsion complications."

    "abstract": "Pneumoperitoneum, characterized by the presence of air in the peritoneal cavity, is usually associated with severe clinical conditions, such as perforations of hollow viscera, often requiring urgent surgical intervention. However, in rare cases, pneumoperitoneum occurs without an identifiable cause, thus classified as idiopathic pneumoperitoneum. We present two clinical cases of women who developed pneumoperitoneum after extensive gynecological surgeries. In the first case, a 63-year-old woman underwent elective hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy due to a large adnexal mass. In the second case, a 55-year-old woman had a similar surgical history. Both patients were treated conservatively, with a positive outcome. Idiopathic pneumoperitoneum is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, especially in the postoperative context. The cases presented underscore the importance of rigorous diagnostic evaluation and a cautious therapeutic approach, suggesting that idiopathic pneumoperitoneum may represent a benign and self-limiting phenomenon rather than a surgical emergency."

    "abstract": "Intermittent severe abdominal pain is a medical emergency with multiple possible underlying causes. This case report describes a 30-year-old female experiencing severe pelvic pain alternating between the left and right lower abdomen. The pain was periodic and very intense. She also experienced intermittent, vague pain in the upper abdomen. Clinical examination and imaging suggested torsion and detorsion of an ovarian fibroma or dysgerminoma. Additionally, a distended dolichocolon was seen in the upper abdomen. Laparoscopy revealed a twisted and enlarged right ovary in the pelvis. In the upper abdomen, a distended dolichocolon was observed along with a twisted, black spleen. The blood vessels of the wandering spleen hung over the colon like a rubber band, causing constriction. The ovary was removed and diagnosed as a cellular fibroma after histopathological examination. Attempts to untwist the spleen laparoscopically were unsuccessful, so a mini-laparotomy was performed to manually untwist it. Afterward, the spleen regained its normal position and color. Due to the significantly elongated dolichosigmoid, which could cause further complications, the affected segment was removed and a reanastomosis was performed. At the end of the procedure, the spleen remained stable in its original position with a healthy coloration. In retrospect, this patient experienced intermittent twisting of the ovary and spleen over an 18-month period, causing severe abdominal pain. The key lessons from this case are to take abdominal pain seriously, thoroughly examine all areas during surgery, and avoid stopping the investigation after identifying a single issue. A critical approach is essential to pinpointing the cause of each specific symptom, as one pathology may not always explain all observed symptoms. This comprehensive approach ultimately saved the patient's spleen."

    "abstract": "Chilaiditi syndrome is a rare disease that has ultimate clinical significance as it can result in misdiagnosis and serious consequences. A 65-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with sudden onset of severe, crampy peri-umbilical abdominal pain of 12 h duration. This patient was referred to our hospital for surgical intervention as the patient was misdiagnosed to have generalized peritonitis. However, upon our evaluation, the patient had no sign of peritonitis, and the abdominal X-ray showed features of the Chilaiditi sign complicated with small bowel obstruction. On that account, Chilaiditi syndrome was diagnosed, and the patient successfully managed non-operatively. Chilaiditi syndrome is clinical features caused by hepatodiaphragmatic bowel interposition. It tends to occur in male elders and commonly involves a colon. In this case, however, a small bowel was also involved and even resulted in its obstruction, which is extremely rare. Chilaiditi syndrome has a radiologic finding that has similarities with that of a bowel perforation. As a result of these, they are commonly misinterpreted as pneumoperitoneum, and the patient can be subjected to a preventable laparotomy. Nevertheless, Chilaiditi's air under the diaphragm has distinctive radiological features, and there will not be peritonitis signs unless the entrapped bowel is strangulated. Chilaiditi syndrome is a benign condition that doesn't need a laparotomy unless it is complicated. However, it should be remembered that air under the diaphragm of a bowel perforation is surgical emergency and needs to be ruled out."

    "abstract": "Non-traumatic abdominal pain is a common emergency presentation frequently managed by general surgeons. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scans are the most popular imaging modality in this context. In many hospitals, the rising demand for urgent and emergent scans out-of-hours has necessitated the outsourcing of this service to teleradiology companies, whereby reports are generated at sites remote from the image acquisition. The primary aim of this study was to determine the discrepancy rates of preoperative CT imaging by source (teleradiology compared to in-house). This was a retrospective monocentric study conducted at a busy district general hospital over a seven-month period. Patient demographic data, operative notes, and radiology reports (by source) were collated for all patients aged ≥16 years presenting with atraumatic abdominal pain who underwent abdominopelvic CT with subsequent surgical intervention (laparoscopy and/or laparotomy). Seventy-one patients were identified by initial screening, and 10 patients (11 scans) met the criteria for a \"major\" discrepancy. Overall discrepancy rates were calculated at 5.6% for scans reported off-site compared to 9.9% for reports generated by in-house radiologists. This study demonstrated lower discrepancy rates in scans reported remotely and can be used as the catalyst for improving aspects of in-house CT reporting."

    "abstract": "Background: Volvulus of gallbladder is defined as a rotation of the gallbladder on its mesentery along the axis of the cystic duct and cystic artery. Many factors are postulated to be the causes such as anatomical, mechanical, physiological, and hormonal risk factors but the presence of a distended gallbladder with a redundant mesentery is thought to be an important cause. Case presentation: A 68-year-old woman presented with right hypochondrial pain and vomiting for 2 days that was radiated to the interscapular region and associated with nausea and vomiting. The patient had no jaundice and the abdominal examination showed severe tenderness with guarding during palpation of the right upper abdomen with no palpable mass. The WBCs were elevated, with normal liver enzymes, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. The ultrasound showed a single gallstone with increased wall thickness. There was no significant clinical improvement with antibiotics and analgesics. During laparoscopy, volvulus of the gallbladder was discovered causing gangrene of the gallbladder. Laparoscopic detorsion and successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy were performed. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day with dramatic improvement with no postoperative complications. Conclusion: Gall bladder volvulus is an acute surgical emergency that is usually seen in the elderly population. It required a high index of suspicion especially in the absence of gallstones and must be differentiated from acalculous cholecystitis. Most cases are discovered at surgery. It must be managed with immediate detorsion and cholecystectomy, and the prognosis is excellent in most cases after an appropriate surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Transomental hernia (TOH) is an extremely rare clinical condition that represents 1-4% of all internal hernias. Spontaneous TOH occurs in patients with no history of surgery or previous abdominal trauma. It happens after protrusion of the abdominal viscera, commonly the small bowel loops through a defect on the great omentum. We present a case of occlusion due to TOH in a 66-year-old man who underwent a laparotomy, and operative exploration showed 10 cm of small bowel incarcerated through a defect in the right side of the greater omentum of 4 cm in diameter. The diagnosis is usually delayed because symptoms are nonspecific. Postoperative morbidity and mortality are important because patients present most frequently with gangrenous bowel, making morbidity and mortality higher. Therefore, it constitutes a critical surgical emergency and must be quickly recognized and managed. Computed tomography (CT) scan plays a prominent role in diagnosis. Midline laparotomy is the main emergency approach for patients with unknown bowel obstruction. Some authors suggest a laparoscopic approach, but it requires a surgeon's experience and propitious patient's conditions. TOH is the rarest type of internal hernia with extremely difficult preoperative diagnosis due to nonspecific semiology. This type of hernia has the highest morbidity and mortality rates of all internal hernias. Thus, it must be suspected whenever there is bowel obstruction of unknown origin and quickly managed."

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the management of emergency management of colon cancer and to evaluate differences in patient outcomes. Conducted at a single surgical emergency center, the study analyzed 182 cases, focusing on demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical methods and patient outcomes. Material and Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted, involving 182 cases who underwent surgery for colon cancer in a single surgical emergency center. Data was collected from hospital records, encompassing demographic details, tumor characteristics, surgical intervention detail and outcomes, alongside with inflammatory profiles. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and t-tests with standard significance at p < 0.05. Results: The study showed that emergency cases had significantly poorer in-hospital survival rates (75.42%) compared to elective surgeries. Inflammatory markers such as Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio, Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio were higher in emergency cases, suggesting heightened systemic stress. Emergency surgery was also associated with a higher incidence of ostomy and postoperative complications. Conclusions: Emergency surgery for colon cancer is linked to more advanced tumors, increased physiological stress and lesser clinical outcomes. Early detection strategies and active targeted screening could reduce the need for emergency interventions. Future research should focus on early diagnosis protocols and enhancing public health strategies to minimize emergency presentations, thereby leading to better outcomes for colon cancer patients."

    "abstract": "Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency caused by elevated pressure within a closed fascial compartment, leading to compromised tissue perfusion and the potential for irreversible damage if not treated promptly. This report presents a rare case of upper limb compartment syndrome in a COVID-19 patient on anticoagulation therapy following multiple failed venipuncture attempts. This work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria. A 67-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and congenital hydrocephalus was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia. He required anticoagulation therapy with Enoxaparin due to his high risk for thromboembolic events. Following multiple failed attempts to secure venous access in the right upper limb, the patient developed severe pain, swelling, and numbness in the limb. Clinical examination revealed pallor, paresthesia, and pulselessness, raising suspicion of compartment syndrome. Ultrasonography confirmed the absence of radial and ulnar arterial flow, with evidence of significant muscular edema and hematoma formation in the anterior compartment of the arm. Due to the patient's pulmonary compromise and elevated risk for general anesthesia, the decision was made to perform a fasciotomy under the WALANT (Wide Awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet) technique. Following the procedure, pulses were restored after evacuation of a deep hematoma compressing the humeral artery, with immediate improvement in hand perfusion. The patient was transferred back to the infectious diseases department for continued COVID-19 management, and the postoperative course was uneventful. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had fully recovered mobility of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers. This case underscores the rare development of upper limb compartment syndrome in a patient on anticoagulation therapy for COVID-19, likely due to venipuncture-related trauma. It highlights the challenges of diagnosing and managing compartment syndrome in critically ill patients, and demonstrates the utility of the WALANT technique in performing fasciotomy in high-risk patients. Early recognition and timely intervention were crucial in ensuring the patient's full functional recovery. Compartment syndrome should be considered in patients on anticoagulation therapy, particularly those with multiple venipuncture attempts. The WALANT technique provides a viable surgical option for fasciotomy in critically ill patients."

We present a case of a pediatric patient diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis in the inguinal area which required debridement and post-operative management of the residual wound using a combination of wound closure techniques. A 10-months-old girl with a history of Food-protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) presented with septic shock and ulcerative lesions of the inguinal area. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our hospital, antibiotic treatment was administered and a diverting colostomy was performed. Serial surgical debridement of the affected tissues resulted in an extensive tissue deficit. Management of the residual skin and soft tissues deficit included application of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) with Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) and was followed by Oasis® extracellular matrix (ECM) graft placement. After 65 days of hospitalization, the wound surface was completely epithelialized. A challenging aspect of NF management is the closure of the residual skin and soft tissue deficit after surgical debridement. Considering the patient's characteristics, a less invasive reconstructive technique was sought. Application of NPWT followed by ECM graft placement are two effective options that can be combined in different stages of wound healing. The management of the residual wound after surgical debridement of the affected tissue in NF requires a patient - specific approach and constant reevaluation of the management plan. NPWT and ECM graft placement can significantly contribute to wound closure and epithelization of the residual deficit in children."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that causes acute abdominal pain and affects approximately 7-8% of the population during their lifetime. The closure of the appendix stump during laparoscopic appendectomy is one of the most critical steps of the surgery to prevent life-threatening complications such as postoperative fistula, peritonitis, and sepsis. The mate-rial chosen for appendix stump closure must be effective, safe, and economical. However, there is still no consensus on the optimal method for stump closure. In this study, we aimed to compare the advantages and reliability of three different methods used for appendix stump closure. At Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Medical Faculty, Department of General Surgery, cases that underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis between January 2022 and April 2024 were retrospectively analyzed using the hospital's data system. The patients' demographic data, laboratory values, pathology reports, surgical notes, duration of hospital stay, duration of surgery, total hospital costs, complications related to the surgery within 30 days postoperatively, and the management of these complications were examined. The study included a total of 150 individuals, with 83 (55.33%) males and 67 (44.67%) females. The average age of the participants was 38.45±14.48 years. In terms of the materials used for stump closure, endoloop was used in 82 (54.67%) cases, Hem-o-lok clip in 30 (20.00%) cases, and endostapler in 38 (25.33%) cases. In 144 (96%) cases, no Clavien-Dindo (CD) complications were observed, while complications occurred in six (4%) cases. These six complications included two intra-abdominal abscesses (CD Grade 3), two wound infections (CD Grade 1), one case of bleeding (CD Grade 2), and one pulmonary embolism (CD Grade 4). The use of endoloop, polymeric clips, and endostapler in laparoscopic appendectomy is safe and effective for appendectomy. All three methods can be successfully applied without an increase in intraoperative or postoperative complications. However, due to the higher treatment costs associated with endostapler, its use should be reserved for situations where securing the appendix stump cannot be achieved with endoloop or Hem-o-lok clip."

We retrospectively examined patients with ITT and compared them to patients with ovarian torsion to better understand the unique features of this pathophysiologic process. The medical records of patients who were identified as having ITT or ovarian torsion intraoperatively between January 2019 and November 2022 were reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical documentation, diagnostic imaging reports, operative reports, and pathology results were collected. A total of 82 patients met inclusion criteria of which 62 (75.6%) had ovarian torsion and 20 (24.4%) had ITT. Most patients (63.4%) underwent 2 or more imaging studies prior to the operating room. A diagnosis of torsion occurred more often on preoperative imaging for the ovarian torsion group (67.7% ovarian torsion vs 35.0% ITT, P = .01). Doppler flow to the ovary was expectedly absent in 65.9% of ovarian torsion patients but interestingly also absent in 25% of ITT patients (P = .01). Patients with ovarian torsion were more likely to have ovarian cysts (56.5% vs 10.0%, P < .001), while patients with ITT were significantly more likely to have a paratubal cyst (90.0% vs 38.7%, P < .001). ITT is a surgical emergency that poses a risk to future fertility. Ultrasound studies, including doppler, may not be as definitive in patients with ITT and early cross-sectional imaging should be considered. When there is a high clinical suspicion for ovarian torsion or ITT, there should be a low threshold for diagnostic laparoscopy."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency in children, often requiring imaging for confirmation due to diverse presentations. While computed tomography scan is favored in many centers for its sensitivity, it comes with radiation exposure and higher costs. Ultrasonography, being radiation-free and cost-effective, is gaining popularity, especially in pediatric cases. However, its reported accuracy varies in the literature. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in pediatric appendicitis cases and to determine its precision in distinguishing between simple and complicated cases of appendicitis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on children with suspected appendicitis who presented to the department of pediatric surgery. All patients underwent ultrasonography followed by appendicectomy based on considered clinical decision. Ultrasonography findings were compared with intraoperative observations categorized as uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis. Among 152 patients, ultrasonography accurately diagnosed appendicitis in 94.6% of cases, with 5.38% having nonvisualized appendices. In our group, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound to detect appendicitis were 94.62% and 95.65%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the test is 95.63%. However, in our study, the sensitivity of the ultrasonography to correctly identify if it is a simple or complicated appendicitis was only 54.9% but had a specificity of 98.7%. Thus, ultrasonography showed a much lower sensitivity (54.9%) in distinguishing between simple and complicated appendicitis. Ultrasonography demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing pediatric appendicitis, making it a promising preoperative investigation. However, it may not accurately differentiate between simple and complicated cases. A comprehensive approach involving clinical and laboratory parameters alongside secondary imaging may be necessary for accurate diagnosis, especially in cases of perforated appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a prevalent surgical emergency, particularly among elderly individuals who present with high perioperative risks. While early cholecystectomy (CCY) is the standard treatment, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is proposed as an alternative for high-risk patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate the comparative safety and efficacy of CCY versus PC in managing AC among elderly and high-risk surgical patients. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ScienceDirect, Europe PMC, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EBSCO Open Dissertations, from July 1 to 15, 2024. Studies published from January 2019 to July 15, 2024, were included if they focused on patients aged 65 and older or those classified as high-risk surgical candidates. The review encompassed 72,366 participants across 22 studies, predominantly observational. Key outcomes assessed included postoperative complications, readmission rates, recurrence of cholecystitis, and mortality rates. This study highlights the need for individualized treatment strategies for managing AC in elderly populations. While CCY remains the preferred approach when feasible, PC offers a critical alternative for high-risk patients. Future research is necessary to optimize outcomes for this vulnerable population."

Inadequate closure of the urachus can result in urachal malformations, with the most common being a urachal cyst. Failure to promptly identify and address this condition can lead to complications such as sepsis, fistula development, and cyst rupture, mimicking symptoms of peritonitis. Therefore, maintaining a heightened level of suspicion is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective management of urachal cysts, particularly in emergency room settings. We present the case of a 24-year-old male who exhibited clinical signs consistent with an acute abdomen. The use of imaging techniques confirmed the presence of an infected urachal cyst, which was successfully treated through surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is an unusual cause of acute abdominal pain. It is more common in elderly patients on anticoagulation. The diagnosis is often challenging, as it mimics other more common causes of acute abdomen. No standard treatment guidelines exist, presenting therapeutic dilemmas. Herein, we describe a case of spontaneous RSH complicated by deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The patient was a 58-year-old female on follow-up for end-stage renal failure, admitted for management of uremic gastritis, fluid overload state, and bronchopneumonia. On the third day of admission, she developed worsening abdominal pains, associated with dizziness, headaches, hypotension, tachycardia, and desaturation. Abdominal examination revealed tender swelling, with localized guarding. An urgent abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated a large complex collection of approximately 12 cm × 10 cm in the left rectus sheath with intraperitoneal extension, consistent with RSH. She underwent laparotomy with evacuation of 1.5 L of hematoma. Her postoperative recovery was complicated by the development of DVT on the sixth postoperative day. Due risk of rebleed, the inferior vena cava filter was favored over therapeutic anticoagulation. Her postoperative hospital stay was thereafter unremarkable. Although rare, RSH is a potential cause of acute abdomen, particularly among patients on anticoagulation, and can be life-threatening. A high index of suspicion is therefore important for early diagnosis. Clinicians should also appreciate the heightened risk of DVT in the immediate postoperative period despite mechanical anticoagulation."

Notably, he has a history of recurrent lower extremity (LE) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) on Coumadin. He came in with shortness of breath (SOB) and was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to Influenza A. A few days into admission, the patient developed acute cardiogenic shock, septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient developed rectal bleeding with a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit. A computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) without (w/o) contrast was performed to find a source. It showed hemorrhagic pancreatitis in the head/tail region. The bleeding resolved on its own without interventions or blood transfusion. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis carries a high mortality rate. In this case, it had an insidious onset with self-resolution, a rare case. Physicians should make quick referrals for surgical resection in hopes of better outcomes."

While it may not show any symptoms, it has the potential to cause serious complications, such as intestinal obstruction. This case report presents a case of a 27-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with migrating right lower abdomen pain and vomiting. An initial diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. An erect X-ray of the abdomen showed features of small bowel obstruction and with a clinical suspicion of Meckel's, a diagnostic laparoscopy had been planned. However, the diagnostic laparoscopy identified a gangrenous MD with axial torsion, with an ileal loop knotting at the base of Meckel's, causing small bowel obstruction. This entanglement led to an obstruction, which is a rare and challenging clinical scenario. Surgical resection of the affected bowel segment, including the MD, was performed, leading to a complete recovery of the patient. This case study emphasizes the diagnostic difficulties presented by MD, particularly when its symptoms resemble more prevalent illnesses like appendicitis. The rare incidence of axial torsion resulting in gangrene in MD with small bowel obstruction highlights the significance of including this illness in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen."

Appendectomy, either through open surgery or laparoscopy, is the standard treatment. Understanding the factors contributing to post-appendectomy complications is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Aim This retrospective study aimed to assess the surgical outcomes of various surgical approaches for appendicitis in Taif City, Saudi Arabia, specifically at King Abdulaziz Specialist Hospital. Methodology A total of 220 patients who underwent appendectomy in 2022 were included in the study. Data were obtained from medical files, and statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were utilized, with a significance level set at p < 0.05. Results The majority of patients fell within the 20-39 age group (n = 124, 56.4%), and males constituted 63% (n = 140) of the cohort. Mean complications post-surgery were observed in 5.5% (n = 12) of cases, with surgical site infection being the most common complication (n = 9, 75%). Patients with complicated appendicitis had a significantly higher rate of surgical complications (n = 8, 44.4%) compared to those without complicated appendicitis (n = 4, 2%, p = 0.000). Longer hospital stays were associated with a higher incidence of complications (p = 0.008). The American Society of Anesthesiologists classification showed a significant association with complications (p = 0.000). Conclusions Our study underscores the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate surgical management, and infection prevention strategies in reducing post-appendectomy complications. Factors such as complicated appendicitis, longer hospital stays, and higher ASA classification were associated with increased complication rates."

    "abstract": "Abdominal surgical emergencies have a high mortality rate. Effective management primarily relies on the early identification of patients at high risk of postoperative complications. The objective of our study was to determine the prognostic factors associated with poor outcomes from abdominal surgical emergencies in Senegal and to establish a predictive score for mortality for preoperative risk evaluation (NDAR (New Death Assessment Risk) score). This was a retrospective national cross-sectional study conducted over one year in 14 regions of Senegal. Adult patients (aged > 15 years) who presented with a traumatic or non-traumatic abdominal surgical emergency were included. The studied variables included clinical and paraclinical data. The variable of interest was death within 30 days of the surgery. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors independently associated with mortality. Risk factors identified after logistic regression analysis were weighted using odds ratio (OR) values rounded to the nearest whole number. The predictive capacity of the score was evaluated by analyzing the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve based on the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 1114 patient records were included, with a mortality rate of 4.4%. Diagnoses were observed in patients included appendicitis in 39.8% of cases (n = 444), followed by peritonitis in 22.3% (n = 249), intestinal obstruction in 18.5% (n = 205), strangulated hernias in 10.5% (n = 117), and abdominal trauma in 6.1%. Logistic regression, established the following scores: age > 40 years (score 2), ASA status grade 2 or higher (score 1), presence of a positive QSIRS score (score 2), diagnosis of peritonitis (score 2), diagnosis of intestinal obstruction (score 1), and the presence of intestinal necrosis (score 3). The score is positive if the total is strictly greater than 5, indicating a 17.7% risk of mortality. This score had a high predictive capacity with an AUC of 0.7397. This study enabled the establishment of a score that allows for the early identification of at-risk patients, even in constrained resource settings, facilitating appropriate perioperative management and timely surgical intervention to reduce the risk of complications. This approach, focused on early recognition of high-risk patients, is crucial for improving clinical outcomes in abdominal surgical emergencies."

    "abstract": "Closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is rare and should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. The association between polymyalgia rheumatica and diverticular disease requires further research but may prompt clinicians to consider appropriate therapies in patients with both diseases. Jejunal diverticulosis is a sac-like outpouching of the intestinal wall that can cause complications such as diverticulitis, obstruction, abscess, perforation, or fistula formation. Complicated jejunal diverticulosis may present with acute abdomen and nonspecific symptoms which can lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. A 76-year-old male with a remote history of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) presented with sudden onset abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and inability to pass flatus. Physical exam revealed a distended and diffusely tender abdomen with signs of peritonitis. Laboratory test results were significant for neutrophil-dominant leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. CT scan of the abdomen with IV contrast revealed a contained perforation and a closed-loop small bowel obstruction in the mid-abdomen. The patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and resection of 100 cm of mid-jejunum which was found to have numerous diverticula surrounding the closed-loop obstruction and contained perforation. Pathology findings showed evidence of acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis. Jejunal diverticulosis with complications may present with an acute abdomen and peritonitis. Closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is uncommonly thought of and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Additionally, the association between PMR and diverticular disease is notable. While the patient had a remote history but no active PMR on presentation, studies suggest a possible association between gut inflammation and rheumatologic disease. This association should prompt clinicians to consider appropriate therapies and bear in mind the potential risk for diverticular perforation if glucocorticoids are given to treat PMR. Jejunal diverticulosis with multiple complications such as closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is rare and may present with an acute abdomen and nonspecific symptoms. Including rare pathologies as such in the differential diagnosis may prevent misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. While further investigation is needed, the association between diverticulosis and PMR is noteworthy as patients who present with both diseases would require mindful management due to the potential risk of diverticular perforation after treatment with steroids."

Risks associated with fibroids during pregnancy include potential for pain, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, higher cesarean delivery rate, fetal malpresentation, placenta abruption, and postpartum hemorrhage. Case Presentation  This case describes a 26-year-old gravida 1 para 0 who presented at early term for severe abdominal pain and was found to have acute abdomen accompanied by a nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing. With emergent cesarean delivery, it was found that the patient was hemorrhaging from a ruptured vessel of a pedunculated fibroid and myomectomy was subsequently performed. Conclusion  While rare, hemorrhage from a uterine fibroid should be considered a part of the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in pregnant patients with fibroids, particularly when accompanied by concurrent indicators such as free fluid, hypotension/tachycardia, or concerning changes in fetal heart rate, especially in a patient without risk factors for uterine rupture."

Pediatric hospitalizations for acute appendicitis in 2022 were extracted from the Brazilian national database. We included all hospitalizations for patients aged 0-16 years with a primary ICD-10 diagnosis of acute appendicitis who underwent an operation. Parameters of interest were the type of surgical approach, mortality, and total cost of hospitalization. Facilities were defined as basic-facility, full-facility, and pediatric according to the level of pediatric resources available. In 2022, there were 29,983 pediatric appendectomies due to acute appendicitis. Of these, 90.2% were open appendectomies. Most occurred in basic-facility general hospitals (53.0%), followed by full-facility (35.2%) and pediatric hospitals (11.8%). Full-facility hospitals had a higher median cost (USD126.3, IQR 99.5-154.4) compared to basic (USD96.8, IQR 87.6-130.1) and pediatric hospitals (USD103.0, IQR 91.9-117.5), though the cost difference between basic and pediatric was not significant (p = 0.367). Death was a rare event across all levels of hospital infrastructure and for all types of procedures performed.

However, alternative drainage modalities such as percutaneous cholecystostomy tube (PCT) placement have been proposed for poor surgical candidates or in remote environments, such as space. We reviewed the literature to assess the theoretical utility of PCT to treat acute cholecystitis during long-duration spaceflight or on the Moon or Mars. A systematic review of 16 peer-reviewed articles published since 2018 was completed to describe the terrestrial efficacy of PCT placement for acute calculous cholecystitis. The mean initial clinical success rate after PCT was 89.9% (range 82.2-100.0%). Duration of indwelling PCT ranged from median 6 to 58 d. Mean rate of recurrent cholecystitis was 15.8% (range 5.0-36.4%). A mean 35.6% of patients (range 18.0-61.0%) required interval cholecystectomy. Mean 30-d mortality was 9.6% (range 5.8-14.0%). A mean 18.6% of patients (range 7.2-30.0%) required repeat percutaneous intervention due to PCT placement complications. While PCT achieves high rates of early resolution of cholecystitis, the long-term outcomes after PCT are relatively poor, with risk of recurrent cholecystitis, need for cholecystectomy, and frequent postprocedural complications requiring repeat procedural interventions. In cislunar space, the return to Earth for cholecystectomy following PCT may be achieved, eliminating some of these concerns. However, with long-duration space travel such as a mission to Mars, PCT is likely inadequate for the long-term treatment of cholecystitis. Prophylactic cholecystectomy, developing surgical capabilities in space, or preflight screening ultrasound for cholelithiasis should be seriously considered for long-duration spaceflight.

The study hypothesized that the response to transfusions might vary significantly between these groups due to the differences in the underlying pathology and clinical status. The study included 107 pediatric patients admitted to Timisoara 'Louis Turcanu' Emergency Hospital for Children between January 2015 and May 2023, who required blood transfusions for preoperative anemia. Hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), and red blood cell counts (RBC) were assessed at admission, 48 h post-transfusion, and at discharge. Statistical analyses, including Student's t-test, Pearson correlation, and chi-square tests, were utilized to compare outcomes between the groups. The study population was divided into 53 children with CM and 54 with AA. Initial analyses showed that children with CM had statistically significantly higher baseline HGB (8.54 ± 1.00 g/dL vs. 7.87 ± 1.02 g/dL, p = 0.001) and HCT (26.07 ± 3.98% vs. 23.95 ± 2.90%, p = 0.002) compared to those with AA. Post-transfusion, children with CM exhibited a greater increase in HGB, with the highest increases noted in patients with central nervous system defects (mean increase of 3.67 g/dL, p = 0.038). In contrast, the increases in HGB for children with AA were less pronounced, with the highest being 2.03 g/dL in those with peritonitis (p = 0.078). No significant gender differences were noted in response to transfusion. Children with congenital malformations respond more effectively to preoperative blood transfusions compared to those with acute abdomen conditions. These findings suggest that differential transfusion strategies may be required based on the underlying medical condition to optimize the management of preoperative anemia in pediatric patients. Tailoring transfusion approaches according to specific patient needs and conditions could enhance clinical outcomes and resource utilization in pediatric surgical settings."

    "abstract": "Midgut malrotation with volvulus is a surgical emergency with potentially devastating outcomes which include short gut syndrome necessitating long-term parenteral nutrition, overwhelming sepsis, and death. The clinical presentation is most frequently with bilious vomiting in the first days-weeks of life, which is non-specific and common. Timely imaging investigation is therefore crucial to prevent delays to diagnosis and treatment and avoid unnecessary surgical exploration in infants with non-surgical bilious vomiting. Fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal contrast series (UGI) has been the first-line imaging modality to investigate midgut malrotation at pediatric surgical centers worldwide. However, there is a growing body of evidence to indicate that ultrasound (US) has greater diagnostic accuracy than UGI in this context. Furthermore, US offers the benefits of accessibility, portability, lack of ionizing radiation, and the ability to identify alternative diagnoses, and is beginning to attract significant attention and consideration in the literature. Over the last 3 years, we have transitioned to an \"US-first\" pathway for the investigation of midgut malrotation in infants with bilious vomiting.

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain in pediatrics is a medical emergency that requires special attention. During COVID-19 pandemic, this disease presented in pediatric age by different presentations including abdominal presentations.The affected children are presented with abdominal pain, which may be caused by surgical causes or by the virus itself that necessitate surgical consultation. This study highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain regarding the presentation, clinical evaluation, and surgical management. A retrospective cohort study was done through the collection of data from medical records and authors' data repositories of pediatric patients presented with acute abdomen from March 2020 to March 2022, in three pediatric surgery tertiary centers. Eighty-four pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain were included in this study. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis was found in 31 patients (36.9%). Generalized abdominal pain was noted in 17 patients (20.2%) and presentation mimicked acute cholecystitis was occured in 14 patients (16.7%). ultrasonography revealed intussusception in 12 cases (14.3%). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was present in 9 cases (10.7%) and only one case of pancreatitis (1.2%). Conservative management was successful in 66 cases (78.6%), while operative intervention was needed in18 cases (21.4%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, acute abdominal pain in children was frequently observed. Careful follow up is critically important as most cases do not necessitate surgical intervention. It is crucial to consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis in children presenting with acute abdominal pain, particularly in cases of atypical appendicitis and intussusception to prevent unnecessary surgical procedures."

    "abstract": "Richter's hernia is a rare but serious surgical emergency involving the entrapment or strangulation of part of the bowel's circumference in the hernial orifice, often without causing complete luminal obstruction. This case report describes a man in his 70s presenting with a 3-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting, despite normal bowel movements. Blood results revealed raised inflammatory markers, and computed tomography imaging suggested small bowel obstruction due to an incarcerated left inguinal hernia. Emergency surgery confirmed a Richter's hernia with a strangulated but viable bowel loop. Early surgical intervention led to a positive outcome. This case underscores the importance of high suspicion, early referral, and timely imaging in managing Richter's hernia to prevent severe complications, such as gangrene and perforation. Despite the absence of obstructive symptoms, early surgical intervention is critical when there is clinical concern regarding strangulation."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most prevalent surgical emergency. The negative appendicectomy rate and diagnostic uncertainty are important concerns. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of current appendicitis risk prediction models in patients with acute right iliac fossa pain. A nationwide prospective observational study was conducted, including all consecutive adult patients who presented with right iliac fossa pain. Diagnostic, clinical and negative appendicectomy rate data were recorded. The Alvarado score, Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR), Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) and Adult Appendicitis Score systems were calculated with collected data to classify patients into risk categories. Diagnostic value and categorization performance were evaluated, with use of risk category-based metrics including 'true positive rate' (percentage of appendicitis patients in the highest risk category), 'failure rate' (percentage of patients with appendicitis in the lowest risk category) and 'categorization resolution' (true positive rate/failure rate). A total of 3358 patients from 84 centres were included. Female patients were less likely to undergo surgery than men (71.5% versus 82.5% respectively; relative risk 0.866, 95% c.i. 0.834 to 0.901, P < 0.001); with a three-fold higher negative appendicectomy rate (11.3% versus 4.1% respectively; relative risk 2.744, 95% c.i. 2.047 to 3.677, P < 0.001). Ultrasonography was utilized in 56.8% and computed tomography in 75.2% of all patients. The Adult Appendicitis Score had the best diagnostic performance for the whole population; however, only RIPASA was significant in men. All scoring systems were successful in females patients, but Adult Appendicitis Score had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value. The RIPASA and the Adult Appendicitis Score had the best categorization resolution values, complemented by their exceedingly low failure rates in both male and female patients. Alvarado and AIR had extremely high failure rates in men. The negative appendicectomy rate was low overall, but women had an almost three-fold higher negative appendicectomy rate despite lower likelihood to undergo surgery. The overuse of imaging tests, best exemplified by the 75.2% frequency of patients undergoing computed tomography, may lead to increased costs. Risk-scoring systems such as RIPASA and Adult Appendicitis Score appear to be superior to Alvarado and AIR."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal system, occurring in approximately 2% of the population. It is rare for MD to be symptomatic or complicated in adulthood. In this case report, we describe a patient who was admitted to the clinic with Meckel's diverticulitis, which had fistulized to the anterior abdominal wall, and was incidentally found to have an ileal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) on radiological imaging. A 46-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed localized guarding on the right side of the umbilicus. Blood tests showed elevated acute-phase reactants, including a white blood cell count of 13,800/µL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 165 mg/L. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated Meckel's diverticulitis fistulizing to the anterior abdominal wall and a polypoid structure in the ileum distal to the MD. The patient underwent emergency surgery, during which segmental ileal resection and ileocolic anastomosis were performed. On the fourth postoperative day, the patient developed an anastomotic leak. Relaparotomy, right hemicolectomy with end ileostomy, and mucous fistula creation were subsequently performed. Pathological examination of the resected ileum from the initial surgery revealed a benign IMT distal to the MD. The patient was discharged on the 40th postoperative day after developing a surgical site infection following the second surgery. The end ileostomy was closed six months later. In this case, it appears that the ileal IMT located distal to the MD may have caused intermittent intestinal obstruction, fecal stasis, and the development of Meckel's diverticulitis. Furthermore, a detailed examination of the patient's history, laboratory results, and radiologic tests may contribute to the detection of incidental pathologies and influence treatment choices."

This study aimed to describe the etiological profile of NTSCI in the Rheumatology Department of the University Hospital Center of Bogodogo (CHU-B). This was a cross-sectional, retrospective study with descriptive and analytical aims, conducted from March 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023, in the Rheumatology Department of CHU-B. Patients diagnosed with non-traumatic spinal cord compression syndrome during hospitalization were included. The frequency in the Rheumatology Department of NTSCI was 2.94%, accounting for 104 patients. There were 68 men (65.38%), with a sex ratio of 1.88. The average age of the population was 57.91 years. All patients experienced back pain, with a lumbar location in 77 patients (74.04%). The average duration of the motor deficit was 2.97 months. A total of 3,532 patients were admitted to the conventional hospitalization unit of the Rheumatology Department at the CHU-B from March 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023. Among these, 104 patients had NTSCI, yielding a frequency of 2.94%. Spinal MRI was performed in 58 patients (55.77%), and the compression was extradural in 76.92% of cases (n = 80). The etiologies identified were Pott's disease in 32 patients (30.77%), followed by spinal metastases in 22 patients (21.15%). Twenty-nine patients (27.89%) experienced complications related to prolonged bed rest. No factor was significantly associated with the recovery of the motor deficit. Non-traumatic spinal cord injury is relatively rare in rheumatological practice in Ouagadougou. The etiology is predominantly Pott's disease, which confirms the geographical distribution of NTSCI causes."

    "abstract": "Jejunal diverticulosis is a rare form of diverticulosis characterized by acquired pseudodiverticula in the small bowel. Although most cases are asymptomatic, the condition can present diagnostic challenges due to its atypical presentation. Complications such as perforation can lead to acute abdomen, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. We report a rare case of perforated jejunal diverticulitis in an 84-year-old female with a known history of diverticular disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a focus of air adjacent to the mesentery, indicative of bowel perforation. An urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, which identified a 4-cm perforated jejunal diverticulum. The affected segment of the small bowel was resected, followed by primary side-to-side jejunal anastomosis. The patient was discharged home in stable condition following uneventful postoperative recovery. This case highlights the importance of including jejunal diverticulosis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, particularly in elderly patients with a history of diverticular disease. Due to the nonspecific presentation, prompt imaging is crucial for diagnosis. Surgical intervention is often necessary in cases of perforation. Increased clinical awareness of this rare condition may help reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes."

This report presents the case of a 21-year-old woman who presented with 7 weeks and 4 days of amenorrhoea and 14 hours of acute abdominal pain. On examination, she was in haemorrhagic shock with signs of acute abdomen. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a haemoperitoneum of 1500 mL and active bleeding from a 3×2 cm rupture in the right hemidiaphragm. Haemostasis was achieved and the patient recovered well post-operatively.

Similarly, another uncommon condition that resembles AA is appendiceal diverticulitis (AD), which is a rare form of vermiform appendix pathology. It is exceedingly uncommon for the two to occur simultaneously. We present the case of a 41-year-old male presented with a one-day history of sudden onset of right iliac fossa (RIF) pain associated with a two-day history of nausea and fevers. The only notable lab finding was elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Clinical examination revealed right abdominal and renal angle tenderness, with RIF rebound and guarding. Computed tomography (CT) concluded acute uncomplicated appendicitis with a subhepatic appendix and he was planned for an emergent laparoscopic appendicectomy. Exposure of the retrocaecal appendix with the caecum in the right loin posed a challenging laparoscopy. The appendix was found to be adherent to the duodenum, right kidney, and transverse colon, and the decision was made to convert to laparotomy to establish safe mobilisation from the duodenum. The appendix was resected in two parts and the histopathology revealed an appendiceal diverticulum with subserosal abscess formation. The subhepatic position of the cecum and appendix is a result of foetal gut malrotation. There is no standard approach for the best course of treatment. The laparotomy conversion gave us better tactile input and direct access to the appendix. Our goal is to educate readers on how to manage an unusual presentation of AA."

    "abstract": "Background Emergency abdominal surgeries pose significant challenges, especially in the Indian population, due to comorbidities, delayed presentations, and limited resources. Accurately predicting morbidity and mortality is crucial for timely interventions and improved patient care. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) have shown potential as prognostic markers, balancing inflammation and nutritional status. Aim The study aims to evaluate the predictive efficacy of NLR and CAR with regard to postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, thereby contributing to better risk stratification and management strategies. Patients and methods A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital in northern Karnataka from August 2022 to June 2024, involving 102 patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgeries. The sample size (71) was calculated using G*Power software, targeting a 95% power with a 5% significance level. The inclusion criterion was patients aged over 18 years undergoing emergency abdominal surgeries; those who were immunocompromised, on steroid therapy, having malignancies, undergoing radiotherapy, or having chronic liver diseases were excluded from the study. Patients coming into the surgical inpatient department (IPD) with an acute abdomen requiring emergency abdominal surgeries as an emergency were preoperatively assessed using complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and serum albumin tests. NLR and CAR were evaluated preoperatively and at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. The outcome measures included surgical site infection rates, hospital stay duration, and outcome in the form of recovery or death. SPSS version 20 was used for statistical analyses. Results The study included 102 patients whose mean age was 43.7 ± 18.9 years; 74 of the participants (72.5%) were male. The most common procedures were exploratory laparotomy (64 patients; 62.7%) and appendicectomy (32 patients; 31.4%). A significant increase in CAR levels was observed on postoperative days 1 and 2 compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Preoperative NLR ≥ 8 was significantly associated with higher mortality (65% vs. 50%, p < 0.01). Preoperative albumin > 3.2 g/dL was associated with better outcomes (recovery in 54 patients; 65.9%) compared to < 3.2 g/dL (15 patients; 75% mortality). This study showed that NLR and CAR are valuable predictors of postoperative outcomes, with CAR indicating the risk for surgical site infections (SSI) and NLR predicting mortality. Conclusion The preoperative NLR had a significant association with mortality among the patients. Hence the NLR can be a good marker for the worst outcome and CAR during the postoperative period can be considered as a marker to detect the risk of SSI. NLR and CAR are simple, inexpensive tests readily available from routine blood investigations. The utility of NLR and CAR as valuable prognostic markers in the perioperative assessment of patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery could enhance the prediction of patient outcomes and guide more effective management strategies to improve patient outcomes in high-risk emergency abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain stands as one of the foremost reasons for consultation among pediatric patients, presenting a diagnostic challenge owing to its diverse underlying causes. The manifestation of abdominal pain varies according to age, associated symptoms, and pain localization. While frequently self-limited, certain conditions exist that endanger life and require urgent intervention. Acute abdomen denotes severe, non-traumatic abdominal pain resulting from inflammatory, ischemic, obstructive, infectious, gynecological, or metabolic etiologies, warranting immediate therapeutic intervention.  Infectious processes that mimic acute abdominal conditions are relatively uncommon. Consequently, the identification of infectious gastroenteritis as a probable etiology of acute abdomen can prevent unnecessary surgical interventions in patients. This report details two cases: a 14-year-old pediatric patient presenting with acute abdominal pain, in whom appendiceal involvement was ruled out through ultrasonographic and computed tomography (CT) examinations, confirming the presence of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, and a 10-year-old pediatric patient presenting with a sudden onset of abdominal pain. CT findings revealed an appendiceal fecalith without concurrent inflammation but accompanied by mesenteric adenitis. Even though conservative treatment did not improve the pain, it was later determined that the patient was a carrier of enteroinvasive E. coli. In both cases, antimicrobial treatment with rifaximin 200 mg every eight hours was administered, leading to the resolution of the conditions without the need for hospital readmission or additional therapy.  Infectious conditions stemming from enteroaggregative and enteroinvasive E. coli can mimic acute abdomen and should be regarded as potential infectious etiologies when other more common causes have been ruled out."

    "abstract": "Lower gastrointestinal perforation (LGP) is a surgical emergency disease that can result in secondary bacterial peritonitis. Microbiological studies on LGP are rare. The present study aimed to ascertain the microbiological profile of LGP in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at our institute after surgery. In addition, we investigated whether initial empirical therapy with vancomycin was associated with in-hospital mortality, duration of ICU stay, and duration of ventilator support. This single-center, retrospective, observational study was conducted at Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Japan. The study population included all patients diagnosed with LGP who were admitted to the ICU after emergency surgery between 2017 and 2023. The primary outcome assessed was the microbiological profile of microorganisms isolated from ascites fluid and blood of the participants. The secondary end-points were in-hospital mortality, duration of ICU stay, and duration of ventilator support. We performed univariate and multivariate regression analyses to evaluate the end-points. During the study period, 89 patients were included in the analysis. The most commonly identified pathogen from the ascites cultures was Escherichia coli (65.2%), followed by Enterococcus spp. (51.7%). E. faecium was identified in 16 (18.0%) ascites samples. The microbiological profile of critically ill patients with LGP admitted to the ICU after surgery was similar to that of previous studies on intra-abdominal infection (IAI). Therefore, the initial empirical therapy in the IAI guidelines is more appropriate for LGP. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that the combination of initial empirical therapy with vancomycin was not associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-3.00, p = 0.955), duration of ICU stay (coefficient=-0.92, 95% CI -3.04-1.21, p = 0.393), or duration of ventilator-support (coefficient=-9.03, 95%CI -49.69-31.63, p = 0.659). The microbiological profile of critically ill patients with LGP admitted to the ICU after surgery was similar to that of previous studies on IAI. However, the frequency of E. faecium in the present study was higher than that in previous studies. Initial empirical therapy with drugs such as meropenem in combination with vancomycin for E. faecium was not associated with in-hospital mortality, duration of ICU stay, and duration of ventilator support, after adjusting for confounding factors."

It predominantly occurs during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, with an incidence of up to 0.1% in the third trimester. Dermoid and functional ovarian cysts, most commonly associated with benign serous cystadenomas, are frequently identified among the torted adnexal masses. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 32-year-old primigravida with a known ovarian cyst diagnosed in the first trimester, which was managed conservatively throughout the pregnancy. At 36 weeks of gestation, she presented with abdominal pain and was subsequently managed with an emergency caesarean section at 37 weeks due to the development of an acute surgical abdomen. During the procedure, a torted left tubo-ovarian complex was excised, with partial preservation of the healthy-appearing ovarian tissue. Histopathological examination identified the mass as a benign serous cystadenoma. Conclusions: Ovarian torsion during pregnancy poses a significant diagnostic challenge.

We aimed to clarify the actual incidence and risk factors of parasitic myoma after laparoscopic myomectomy using uncontained power morcellation by reviewing cases with subsequent laparoscopic surgery. This retrospective study included 87 patients who had laparoscopic myomectomy using uncontained power morcellation, followed by subsequent second laparoscopic surgery for gynecological disease between 2008 and 2021. First, the incidence and characteristics of parasitic myomas detected at the second laparoscopic surgery were reviewed. Second, patients were stratified according to the presence of parasitic myoma (PM+ and PM- groups), and risk factors were analyzed by comparing the background, intraoperative findings, and clinical course after laparoscopic myomectomy. Of the 87 patients, parasitic myomas were detected in 16 (18.4%). Twelve patients (75.0%) were asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally during surgery. Two patients presented with acute abdomen requiring emergency surgery. Comparing the PM+ and PM- groups, the total weight of the enucleated myomas and the diameter of the largest myoma at the initial laparoscopic myomectomy were significantly greater in the PM+ group. Other factors, including age and number of enucleated myomas did not differ between the groups. The actual incidence of parasitic myoma after laparoscopic myomectomy using uncontained power morcellation is higher than that previously reported. In laparoscopic power morcellation, large myomas increase the risk of developing parasitic myoma, and a containment bag system is expected to minimize this complication."

Uncommonly, it is found to be the cause of serious complications such as interstitial obstruction and/or gangrene, bowel perforation, and, in rare cases, internal bowel herniations. A mesodiverticular band is a congenital fibrous band connecting the Meckel's diverticulum to its own mesentery, predisposing it to complications. Both conditions arise from a failure of regression of the vitellointestinal duct and its feeding artery. The presence of a mesodiverticular band significantly raises the possibility of complications, especially those of internal herniation and subsequent bowel obstruction. Detection of a Meckel's diverticulum is challenging in routine investigations such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography, and scintigraphy with Tc99 is required. The availability of such scans is limited, and their use is further difficult in emergent situations such as intestinal obstruction. This condition is, therefore, more frequently detected at laparotomies. Herein, we report a case of intestinal obstruction in a young female who presented to our emergency room with an acute abdomen and was found to have a mesodiverticular band causing internal herniation and subsequent obstruction."

    "abstract": "The fallopian tube is a common surgical specimen, yet there is limited research on the histomorphologic findings. This study seeks to review the various abnormalities found in the fallopian tube and establish the primary disease processes linked to it. These findings can provide valuable insights for future preventive healthcare measures. Utilizing PubMed, a search was conducted for articles published between 2009 and 2024 to investigate fallopian tube pathologies using case reports. The inclusion criteria focused on patients older than 18 years with confirmed or incidental fallopian tube pathology diagnoses. The study considered both common and uncommon presentations of fallopian tube pathologies, with a primary focus on identifying the presenting symptoms related to these conditions, such as primary infertility, severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypotension, and breathlessness (the last three could indicate a surgical emergency with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and subsequent hemoperitoneum). Fifteen studies were included in this review. The findings revealed three cases of genital tuberculosis, two cases of endometriosis, two cases of fallopian tube prolapse, three cases of ovarian cancer, and four cases of ectopic pregnancy. To confirm the presence of these conditions, histopathological examination was performed using specimens obtained through salpingectomy/salpingostomy. This study effectively highlighted the occurrence of rare presentations associated with common fallopian tube pathologies. By identifying different pathologies present in the fallopian tube, healthcare professionals can expand the range of existing pathologies that may be considered as potential differential diagnoses. This knowledge is essential in directing patient care and has the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is among common surgical emergency. Subhepatic appendicitis is rare and difficult to diagnose and manage. There are few case reports across the world. We presented a case of 7 year's old child with no known medical illness presented with acute onset vague abdominal pain experienced for three days. he was symptomatically treated as Acute gastroenteritis and dyspepsia later diagnosed with acute appendicitis and underwent laparotomy. He has malrotated subhepatic cecum with Subhepatic gangrenous appendicitis Open appendectomy done and discharged improved. Subhepatic appendicitis is a condition where the appendix is abnormally located in the upper right abdomen. This atypical placement often leads to delayed diagnosis and complications due to its similar symptoms to other abdominal diseases. While ultrasound is a valuable tool for diagnosis, laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred treatment method when available. However, in resource-limited settings without laparoscopic capabilities, open surgery is necessary. Subhepatic appendicitis is a rare occurrence and its infrequent location makes it difficult to diagnose. Awareness of various location of appendix, a high index of suspicion and radiological imaging is required for prompt diagnosis and management. Appendicitis in subhepatic appendix and high up cecum creates a lot of confusion in both diagnosis and surgical exploration which may lead in complication and delay in treatment."

    "abstract": "Adolescents represent an important demographic percentage in the studied population and in Emergency Departments (ED). It is imperative that health professionals and services are prepared to address this population. This work aims to characterize adolescents at the ED of a Brazilian private tertiary hospital. The study was an observational, retrospective longitudinal cohort that included 37,450 visits of patients aged 10 to 21 years of age, between January 2018 and June 2022 in the ED of a private tertiary hospital. The study evaluated the reason for the consultation, diagnosis, need for hospitalization, the medical professional responsible for the care, severity, and paying source of care. 53.7% were female. Mean age was 16.2y for girls and 15.6y for boys (p < 0.005). The most common complaints were flu-like symptoms (17.4%), sore throat (8.2%), fever (6.7%) and limb trauma (6.3%). Flu-like symptoms were the main consultations caused in all age groups and genders. 36.8% were attended by a general practitioner, 35.8% by a pediatrician, 15.1% by orthopedics and 5.6% by surgeons. The hospitalization rate was 5.5%. There was a strong correlation between age and hospitalization rate (correlation coefficient [r = 0.93]; p < 0.001). The most prevalent diagnoses in hospitalizations were acute abdomen (12.7%) and trauma (9.4%). 78.2% of the consultations were classified as \"not urgent\". There was a strong correlation between age and severity (r = 0.86; p < 0.001). 92.7% of the consultations were paid by medical insurance. In this study, flu-like symptoms were the single main reason for adolescents to search for immediate health care, in every age subgroup and gender, but represented a small risk for hospital admission. Limb trauma was more common in younger male teenagers. Acute abdominal pain and trauma were the most frequent causes of hospital admissions. There was a significant and strong correlation between age and both admission rate and severity."

    "abstract": "Synchronous volvulus of the transverse and sigmoid colon is an exceedingly rare clinical presentation. The dual location of strangulation constitutes a critical surgical emergency due to the heightened risk of intestinal necrosis and septic shock. Given the rarity of this condition, there is a notable paucity of detailed information in the literature, and the management strategies are poorly codified. We report the case of a 23-year-old man with a history of bowel transit disorders (diarrhea and constipation), who was admitted as an emergency with typical signs of acute large bowel obstruction. Initial diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus was retained; however, intraoperative findings revealed an associated volvulus of both the transverse and sigmoid colon. A left colectomy was performed followed by colorectal anastomosis. The postoperative period was uneventful. Synchronous volvulus of the transverse and sigmoid colon is an extremely rare occurrence; it should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of acute large bowel obstruction. There is scarcity of information in the literature regarding synchronous sigmoid and transverse colon volvulus. Synchronous volvulus of the transverse and sigmoid colon is an exceedingly rare clinical entity. Diagnosing this condition can be difficult and the management effectiveness remains controversial. It is presumed that sigmoid volvulus is the initial event; therefore, emphasizing the need for early surgical intervention for sigmoid volvulus could potentially improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Description Spinal epidural abscess (SEA), a critical surgical emergency, demands prompt recognition and intervention to prevent severe complications and fatalities. The incidence of SEA is notably increasing, particularly among individuals with diabetes, intravenous drug use, or a history of invasive spinal procedures. Although SEA can manifest through various clinical symptoms, the presence of its classic triad-back pain, fever, and neurological deficits-is noteworthy despite its occurrence in only 10% to 13% of cases. Identifying this triad is vital due to its high specificity for SEA, which is essential to guiding swift diagnostic and therapeutic actions in a condition where early intervention is critical. Magnetic resonance imaging is pivotal in diagnosing SEA, offering unmatched sensitivity and specificity compared to other imaging techniques. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy and timely neurosurgical consultation, when required, form the foundation of SEA treatment. The prognosis significantly depends on the patient's initial neurological status, underlying health conditions, and the timeliness of their presentation, diagnosis, and treatment initiation. Given the complexity of SEA and the high risk of diagnostic delays, managing this condition involves substantial medicolegal considerations. Enhanced comprehension of SEA is imperative for improving patient outcomes and reducing health care resource burdens. Prompt and accurate diagnosis and appropriate interventions are essential for effectively managing this urgent condition."

This study determines the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients presenting with acute abdomen at a tertiary care hospital. To describe the demographic characteristics, provisional diagnoses, treatment modalities, and pain management effectiveness in patients with acute abdomen. This prospective observational study was conducted in the Emergency Medicine department at Dr. D. Y. Patil Medical College, Hospital & Research Center, Pimpri, Pune, over a specified period. The study included patients presenting with acute abdomen, aged above 14 years, excluding those with traumatic acute abdomen and pregnant patients. A sample size of 146 was calculated based on the proportion of ureteric colic cases, with a 95% confidence interval and a 6% margin of error; however, a total of 176 patients were included in the study. Data collection involved recording demographic details, clinical features, provisional diagnoses, and pain scores, as well as performing required blood investigations and ultrasonography. Pain scores were assessed before and after treatment. Patients will be given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opioid analgesia, depending on the clinical severity. Emergency medicine residents, in consultation with the on-call consultant, determined the disposition of patients, deciding if they required surgical or conservative management. The study found that the majority of patients, n = 130 (73.86%), were aged 26-50 years, with cases n = 103 (58.52%) being males and cases n = 73 (41.48%) females. Acute appendicitis was the most common diagnosis, n = 41 (24.43%), followed by urolithiasis n = 33 (18.75%). Surgical interventions were required for n = 78 (45.08%) of patients, highlighting the urgent nature of these conditions. Pain management was effective, with significant reductions in pain scores post-treatment (mean visual analog score (VAS) decreased from 6.22 to 2.33, and mean numerical rating score (NRS) from 6.05 to 2.10; p < 0.001). The study underscores the high prevalence of gastrointestinal and renal conditions in patients with acute abdomen, particularly in middle-aged adults. The high rate of surgical interventions reflects the urgent nature of these conditions. Significant reductions in pain scores demonstrated effective pain management. Comprehensive care strategies are essential for optimizing patient outcomes. Future research with larger sample sizes and multi-center participation is recommended to validate these findings and enhance management protocols for acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Lower abdominal pain is a common complaint for patients presenting for evaluation in the emergency department. Among other life-threatening complications, acute appendicitis needs to be ruled out in the case of right-lower quadrant pain (RLQ). Sigmoid perforation caused by an ingested foreign body is an uncommon cause of RLQ pain. This report presents the case of an otherwise healthy, 29-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with RLQ pain. His initial evaluation raised concern for acute appendicitis. However, during his exploratory laparoscopy, he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon due to a skewer stick; the patient had no recollection of having ingested any foreign body. This paper highlights the importance of considering the possibility of sigmoid perforation by an ingested foreign body as a possible cause of RLQ pain.

She was initially diagnosed as a case of simple unilocular left-sided ovarian cyst based on clinical symptoms and radiological findings. However, biopsy revealed a mesenteric cyst of Mullerian origin. As mesenteric cysts are not common, therefore they becomes extremely challenging for the radiologist, pathologist, and surgeon equally, due to the difficulties encountered in their diagnosis and management.

This study was designed to evaluate maxillofacial injuries occurring following e-scooter accidents. A single-centre retrospective study was conducted from October 2022 to September 2023 reviewing all e-scooter-related maxillofacial injuries which presented to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. During the study period, forty-nine patients (mean [range] age 28 [13-48] years; 32 [65.3%] male) suffered maxillofacial injuries from riding an e-scooter. Twenty patients (40.8%) were under the influence of alcohol and no individual was recorded to have worn a helmet at the time the injury occurred. Ten patients (20.4%) suffered a facial fracture (two mandibular fractures, three zygomatic-orbital fractures, one nasal fracture, and four patients with multiple fractures involving the sphenoid, zygomatic-orbital, and maxillary sinus). Four (40%) of these facial fractures required surgical management. This included one patient with an orbital floor fracture and an associated inferior rectus entrapment, which is a surgical emergency. Thirty-three patients (67.3%) sustained facial lacerations and nine patients (18.4%) sustained dental trauma. Maxillofacial injuries occurring from e-scooter injuries are significant and pose a notable risk to safety. Our study highlights poor compliance and emphasises the need to improve safety through public education, focussing on sobriety. Considerations should be given to speed limitations, safety clothing, e-scooter training, and whether helmets should be mandatory.

A retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with intussusception at three different hospitals in different countries from January 2016 to December 2022. Data collected included demographics, presenting symptoms, duration of symptoms, management, outcomes, and follow-ups. A total of 290 cases of intussusception were included in the study. Ages ranged from 1 to 36 months, with a median age of 15 months. All children underwent an enema reduction which was successful in 92.4%. Failure of reduction was seen in 16.7% of females compared to 6.4% of males, and it was significantly seen in children below the age of 1 year compared to older children. Failure of reduction significantly increases with the duration of symptoms and in children who present with bilious vomiting and currant jelly stool. In conclusion, Failure of enema reduction was more prevalent in females, in children below the age of 1 year and who present late, as well as children who had bilious vomiting and currant jelly stool.

    "abstract": "Background Acute intestinal obstruction is a commonly encountered surgical emergency that is prevalent worldwide and has substantial morbidity and fatality rates. Therefore, swift and precise diagnosis is essential. While mortality rates in urban areas have declined due to timely medical intervention following early detection, the situation contrasts starkly in rural areas. Delays in presentations often lead to complications because of hesitancy toward surgery, economic challenges, and limited access to healthcare information. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate how well multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can help determine the site, cause, and level of intestinal obstruction compared to what the surgeons confirmed intraoperatively. Methodology A prospective study involving 101 patients was conducted at a tertiary care center in western Maharashtra from July 2022 to July 2024. The emergency department referred patients with clinical symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, inability to pass flatus, constipation, or diarrhea, which are commonly seen with intestinal obstruction. The study involved all patients who underwent a contrast-enhanced MDCT scan using both intravenous and oral contrast agents. We selected patients from both genders, regardless of their age; however, considerations were taken to include characteristics convenient and relevant to the study. Patients with abnormal serum creatinine levels or allergies to contrast were excluded from the study. We conducted CT examinations, noting findings such as the transition point between the dilated and collapsed loops, mesenteric fat stranding, and intestinal dilatation. An experienced radiologist made the final report, and the operating surgeons' notes on laparoscopy or open surgery for the same patient were reviewed to understand the operative findings. Results MDCT scans had high diagnostic accuracy for small and large bowel obstruction. Of the 101 patients, the mean age was 43.7 years. There were 70 (69.30%) males and 31 (30.69%) females. Sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 98.1%, positive predictive value was 83.7%, and negative predictive value was 100%. Conclusions MDCT demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing and determining the underlying cause of intestinal obstruction. It identified the location of the obstruction and discerned whether it originated from intrinsic, extrinsic, or intraluminal factors."

It is more common in children below five years old and in males. Several scoring systems aid in the prediction of the disease and help differentiate it from similar differential diagnoses (such as transient synovitis (TS)). The first and most famous scoring system is Kocher's Criteria (KC), which utilizes a mixture of clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory markers to predict the likelihood of the diagnosis. This review aims to assess the current literature to look at primary papers comparing the predicted probability of KC to the original probability described therefore evaluating its efficacy and usefulness in today's pediatric population. PubMed was searched using the terms \"septic arthritis AND hip AND (Kocher OR Kocher's criteria),\" 27 studies resulted, and each study was screened by reading the abstracts. Six studies were included in this review. Inclusion criteria were any study that looked at SA of the hip in the pediatric population prospectively or retrospectively, using KC to help make a diagnosis and looking at the predicted probability of KC. Exclusion criteria included studies looking at adults, joints other than the hip, and papers not assessing the predicted probability. The efficacy of KC for diagnosing SA is not well-supported by current literature. Studies indicate that KC have low specificity for SA, suggesting it should not replace arthrocentesis as the diagnostic gold standard. Clinicians should use this model cautiously, and more extensive, prospective studies are needed to validate its effectiveness."

Septic arthritis of the shoulder joint is a diagnostic and surgical emergency because joint destruction develops rapidly and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Unusual complications of septic arthritis of the shoulder joint may include extra-articular abscess extension to the upper arm through the biceps groove and osteomyelitis of the greater tuberosity. Septic arthritis of the shoulder, if left untreated, can lead to complications such as extra-articular abscess extension and osteomyelitis.

MRI diagnosed septic arthritis of shoulder joint together with an upper arm abscess. Arthroscopic debridement with through irrigation and open drainage of the extra-articular abscess extension to the upper arm improved both the shoulder pain and abscess completely. However, if shoulder pain or abnormalities in laboratory findings continue after initial treatment, uncontrolled septic arthritis or secondary osteomyelitis are possibilities that should be concerned. MRI is a useful tool for detecting those atypical complications. Rarely, septic arthritis of the shoulder joint can extend to the upper arm through the biceps tendon groove and cause an abscess. Also, acute osteomyelitis of the tuberosity should be considered in patients with long-standing refractory septic arthritis of the shoulder joint who have continued pain and uncontrolled laboratory findings after initial treatment."

    "abstract": "Pediatric appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain in children and is recognized as a significant surgical emergency. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential to prevent complications such as perforation and peritonitis. To investigate the predictive value of the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) combined with the pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) for the assessment of disease severity and surgical outcomes in children aged 5 years and older with appendicitis. Clinical data of 104 children diagnosed with acute appendicitis were analyzed. The participants were categorized into the acute appendicitis group and chronic appendicitis group based on disease presentation and further stratified into the good prognosis group and poor prognosis group based on prognosis. The SII and PAS were measured, and a joint model using the combined SII and PAS was constructed to predict disease severity and surgical outcomes. Significant differences were observed in the SII and PAS parameters between the acute appendicitis group and chronic appendicitis group. Correlation analysis showed associations among the SII, PAS, and disease severity, with the combined SII and PAS model demonstrating significant predictive value for assessing disease severity [aera under the curve (AUC) = 0.914] and predicting surgical outcomes (AUC = 0.857) in children aged 5 years and older with appendicitis. The study findings support the potential of integrating the SII with the PAS for assessing disease severity and predicting surgical outcomes in pediatric appendicitis, indicating the clinical utility of the combined SII and PAS model in guiding clinical decision-making and optimizing surgical management strategies for pediatric patients with appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulitis (MD) mimics acute appendicitis with right lower abdominal pain. Clinicians must consider MD in acute abdomen cases to avoid diagnostic delays. Perforated MD can lead to serious complications. Timely use of advanced imaging and surgical assessment is essential for accurate diagnosis and management. Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a gastrointestinal congenital anomaly that signifies a persistent remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct. While frequently asymptomatic, its complications vary widely, ranging from mild and painless to potentially life-threatening conditions. This is a case of a 4-year-old female patient with sudden abdominal pain and tenderness, with an elusive cause before surgery. The definitive diagnosis of a perforated MD was established during diagnostic laparoscopy due to worsening symptoms. Detecting MD and its potential complications requires a high degree of suspicion. Once recognized, prompt management is essential to prevent further complications. Although perforation is uncommon in MD, its symptoms can mimic acute appendicitis, confusing emergency settings. This article underscores the significance of diagnosing MD, despite its rarity, and emphasizes the necessity for swift treatment upon identification."

    "abstract": "The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria have rapidly developed into a principal methodological framework for nutrition diagnosis. However, the applicability of the GLIM criteria in patients with acute abdomen has not been validated. This is a cross-sectional study conducted on patients diagnosed with acute abdomen and admitted to a tertiary hospital in southwest China. Nutrition risk screening was conducted using the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002, and patients identified with nutrition risk were assessed for malnutrition based on the GLIM criteria. We enrolled a total of 440 patients with acute abdomen. The top three diagnoses of acute abdomen were intestinal obstruction (47.2%), acute appendicitis (23.1%), and digestive system perforation (8.8%). The prevalence of nutrition risk was 46.5%, with a malnutrition rate of 32.5% based on the GLIM. Patients with malnutrition according to the GLIM showed significantly higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (13.28% vs 7.07%; P = 0.003), increased hospitalization costs (median: 3315USD [interquartile range (IQR): 978-7852] vs 1641 [IQR: 816-3523] USD; P < 0.001), and longer length of hospital stay (LOS) (median: 8 [IQR: 5-13] vs 6 [IQR: 4-8] days; P < 0.001) compared with patients without malnutrition. Multivariate analysis indicated that GLIM-defined malnutrition was an independent predictor of hospitalization costs, and severe malnutrition was an independent predictor of ICU admission. GLIM criteria are applicable for diagnosing malnutrition in patients with acute abdomen. The prevalence of malnutrition was high in patients with acute abdomen. Malnutrition was associated with increased ICU admission and LOS, along with higher economic burden."

We present a case of acute abdomen with peritoneal signs and symptoms due to epiploic appendagitis (EA) that resolved with a single dose of ibuprofen. EA often mimics appendicitis, diverticulitis, and rarely cholecystitis based on its location. It arises due to ischemic infarction of an epiploic appendage, typically caused by torsion or spontaneous thrombosis of the central draining vein. Despite its rarity, clinicians need to recognize the characteristic imaging findings of EA on CT and ultrasound to avoid unnecessary surgical interventions and to manage the condition conservatively."

Laboratory evaluation revealed she was pregnant with a serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) of 798 mIU/mL. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) revealed a single left tubal pregnancy with a yolk sac. The patient elected medical management with body surface area (BSA)-based intramuscular (IM) methotrexate (MTX). On Day 4, the patient returned to the ED; her b-hCG was 727 mIU/mL. TVUS revealed twin left tubal pregnancies with yolk sacs and fetal poles without cardiac activity. The patient elected to continue medical management with a second dose of BSA-based IM MTX. On Day 6, the patient returned to the ED with abdominal and rectal pain. She was hemodynamically stable without signs of an acute abdomen. Her b-hCG was 533 mIU/mL. TVUS showed persistent twin left tubal pregnancies-one at 5 weeks gestational age and the other at 6 weeks gestational age-without evidence of rupture. The patient continued serial b-hCGs. Thirty-one days after the first dose of MTX, her b-hCG was < 1 mIU/mL. TVUS showed resolution of tubal pregnancies. The patient consented to the publication of this case report. This case documents the successful treatment of spontaneous, unilateral tubal twin pregnancies with two-step dosing of IM MTX."

The current article presents a case of a 23-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with right lower abdominal pain and nausea, accompanied by elevated white blood cell count. Imaging performed, both ultrasound and computed tomography, reported acute appendicitis, without evidence of a broad ligament defect. During exploratory laparoscopy, the defect was identified, the appendix was retrieved and ligated and sutures were applied to the defect. The postoperative course of treatment was uneventful, and pathology confirmed inflammation of the appendix and also revealed a small neuroendocrine tumor. The value of emergency laparoscopy for the diagnosis of this rare condition and the therapeutic management which involves the closure of the defect to prevent future internal hernia are issues highlighted in this article."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency characterized by appendix inflammation. Surgery remains the gold standard for treatment with laparoscopy gaining in popularity. However, the optimal timing for appendectomy remains unclear. We are not aware of studies evaluating potential differences in clinical outcomes among appendectomies performed during the daytime and at night. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched the ScienceDirect, Medline, and Google Scholar databases for studies published in English before June 2023. We included prospective and retrospective studies reporting appendectomy outcomes. We categorized the appendectomy procedure times as daytime or night-time based on each study's definitions. We extracted baseline characteristics and outcomes and assessed the quality of the studies included using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) using random-effects models; and, we assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We analyzed data from 12 studies for systematic review ( n =19,183) including daytime ( n =11,839) and night-time ( n =7344) appendectomies. For the meta-analysis, we included 9 studies, that evaluated outcomes such as mortality (pooled RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.09-2.01; I2 =43.7%; P =0.11), hospital stay (WMD, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.20; I2 =93.3%; P <0.001), and complications (pooled RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.64-1.45; I2 =65.1%; P =0.02). We found similar mortality rates, hospital stay lengths, and complications for the appendectomies, regardless of the time of day of the operation. The baseline characteristics of the patients were also similar, except for the duration of symptoms and the presence of an appendiceal abscess. Our results showed that the timing of an appendectomy (daytime vs. night-time) does not significantly affect its outcomes. Surgeon availability or fatigue, and patient severity may not significantly impact the operation results. Standardized protocols and perioperative care ensure consistent outcomes."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency with diverse clinical presentations, making its diagnosis challenging. Laparoscopic appendectomy has become the standard treatment, with various methods for appendiceal stump closure, including polymeric clips and endoloops. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of polymeric clips compared with endoloops in laparoscopic appendectomy. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted followingPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Embase were searched for studies up to March 25, 2024. In total, 13 studies, including 6 randomized controlled trials, were analyzed. Polymeric clipping demonstrated significantly shorter surgical time compared with the endoloop (standardized mean difference 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.53, P < .00001), with no difference in hospital stay or overall complications. However, the endoloop was associated with a greater incidence of intra-abdominal abscess (risk ratio 3.53, 95% confidence interval 1.56-8.00, P = .003). Other outcomes, including time from instrument application to appendiceal cutting, ileus, and surgical-site infection, showed no significant differences between the 2 techniques. Polymeric clipping appears to be superior to endoloop in terms of shorter surgical time and lower risk of intra-abdominal abscess formation in laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis. However, both techniques have similar outcomes regarding hospital stay and overall complications. Further research addressing study limitations and exploring patient-centered outcomes is warranted to guide clinical practice."

The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal distension, and failure to pass feces and flatus. An emergency laparotomy was performed, revealing a gangrenous segment of the transverse colon. Despite surgical intervention, the patient died due to Multi organ failure (MOF). A patient diagnosed with transverse colon volvulus typically presents with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation or obstipation, and abdominal distension. Physical signs may include abdominal distention, a palpable mass, circulatory collapse, fever, and leukocytosis. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and prompt surgical intervention in managing transverse colon volvulus."

    "abstract": "Although pneumoperitoneum from necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation is a surgical emergency, risk stratification to determine which neonates benefit from initial peritoneal drainage (PD) is lacking. Using a single-center retrospective review of very low birth weight neonates under 1500 g who underwent PD for pneumoperitoneum (January 2015 to December 2023) from necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation, two cohorts were created: drain \"responders\" (patients managed definitively with PD; includes placement of a second drain) and \"nonresponders\" (patients who underwent subsequent laparotomy or died after PD). Antenatal/postnatal characteristics, periprocedural clinical data, and hospital outcomes were compared between responders and nonresponders using Student's t-test, chi-squared test, or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate, with P < 0.05 considered significant. Fifty-six neonates were included: 31 (55%) drain responders and 25 (45%) nonresponders. Birth weight, gestational age, sex, ethnicity, use of postnatal steroids, and enteral feeds were similar between the cohorts. Nonresponders had higher base deficits (-3.4 versus -5.0, P = 0.032) and FiO2 (0.25 versus 0.52, P = 0.001) after drain placement. Drain responders had significantly shorter lengths of stay (89 versus 148 days, P = 0.014) and lower mortality (6.4% versus 56%, P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis of the nonresponders showed no differences in birth weight, vasopressor requirement, FiO2, or postdrain base deficit between nonresponders who had a drain alone versus laparotomy following drain placement. PD remains a viable initial therapy for pneumoperitoneum in premature very low birth weight neonates (< 1500 g), demonstrating clinical response in more than half. Ongoing clinical assessment and judgment is imperative after drain placement to ensure continued clinical improvement."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency with various causes. However, SBO resulting from appendicitis is uncommon and often overlooked. Appendico-ileal knotting, a rare and dangerous form of SBO, occurs when the appendix becomes twisted around the small intestine, leading to strangulation. Despite being reported since 1901, there have been very few documented cases of this condition. Diagnosing appendico-ileal knotting preoperatively is challenging, and even imaging techniques like computed tomography scans may not provide definitive diagnostic findings. Our current case report is a valuable addition to the limited literature and enhances understanding of this infrequent cause of SBO from a resource limited setting. We present the case of a 28-year-old female who presented with symptoms of dynamic SBO, including abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. Preoperative evaluation couldn't determine the exact cause. Diagnosis of a strangulated ileum was discovered, with the appendix identified as the source intraoperatively, leading to an open retrograde appendectomy. Postoperatively, the patient received IV ceftriaxone (1 g daily), metronidazole (500 mg tds), paracetamol (1 g tds), and IV crystalloids. Oral intake resumed gradually, and discharge occurred on day 4. Follow-up on 10th day was uneventful. Appendico ileal knotting is a rare cause of mechanical SBO. Knowledge of its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management is very crucial to reduce its associated morbidity and mortality."

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes, mortality, and morbidity of patients undergoing open abdomen in a public hospital in Brazil and investigate associated risk factors associated with the outcome. Data from electronic medical records were collected from 2017 to 2022. The variables were used for descriptive analyses, association analysis, and survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier curve. The sample included 104 patients, with 84 presenting with acute abdomen and 20 with trauma, having highly variable ages and comorbidities. Peritonitis and the need for early reoperation were the most common indication for the procedure, each accounting for 34%, and negative pressure wound therapy was the most commonly used technique. Fistula was the most frequent complication, with the majority forming in the early days after the surgery. The number of interventions and open abdomen time obtained statistical significance in comparison with the outcome. The overall mortality rate was 62,5%. Despite open abdomen being a technique that can have benefits in controlling intraabdominal contamination and preventing abdominal compartment syndrome, its implementation is associated with complications. The mortality and complication rates were high in this sample. The decision to use the technique should be individualized and based on several factors, including the indications and the patient's clinical status. A técnica de abdome aberto refere-se a um procedimento cirúrgico que envolve deixar deliberadamente uma abertura na parede abdominal. Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar o desfecho clínico, mortalidade e morbidade de pacientes submetidos ao abdome aberto em um hospital público do Brasil e investigar fatores de risco associados ao desfecho. Dados a partir de prontuários eletrônicos foram coletados de 2017 a 2022. As variáveis foram utilizadas para análises descritivas, análise de associação e de sobrevivência pela curva Kaplan-Meier. A amostra correspondeu a 104 pacientes, sendo 84 por abdome agudo e 20 por trauma, com idade e número de comorbidades variados. A peritonite e a necessidade de reabordagem precoce foram as causas mais comuns para a indicação do procedimento, 34% cada, e a terapia de pressão negativa foi a mais utilizada neste estudo, seguindo a técnica de Barker. Fístula é a complicação mais frequente (41%), sendo que a maioria se formou nos primeiros dias após a realização da cirurgia. O número de intervenções e o tempo de abdome aberto obtiveram significância estatística na comparação com o desfecho. A mortalidade geral foi de 62,5%. Apesar de o abdome aberto ser uma técnica que pode trazer benefícios no controle da contaminação intra-abdominal e prevenção de síndrome compartimental abdominal, sua realização está associada a complicações. A taxa de mortalidade e morbidade foram elevadas nesta amostra. A decisão para uso da técnica deve ser individualizada e baseada em vários fatores, incluindo as indicações e o estado clínico do paciente."

    "title": "Clinical Scoring Systems to Diagnose Complicated Acute Appendicitis in a Rural Hospital: Are They Good Enough?",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency in developed countries, whose incidence peaks in the second and third decades. The risk of mortality in uncomplicated AA is very low. There are many scoring systems to predict AA. Prediction scores are used less frequently to predict complicated AA. Rural hospitals are often constrained by a lack of round-the-clock imaging or special laboratory services, which may enable accurate diagnosis. Materials and methods This study aimed to determine whether prediction scores without imaging or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels could predict complicated AA in a rural setting. All cases of AA for the previous 13 months were recruited for the study. Demographic data, clinical signs and symptoms, complete blood counts, intraoperative findings, and the corresponding histopathological results were collated. The scoring systems (Alvarado, RIPASA, Tzanakis, and Ohmann) were calculated from the clinical and laboratory data. Demographic variables, clinical features, and histopathological findings are described as frequencies/proportions. Chi-squared and Student's t-tests were used to analyze differences between patients with complicated and uncomplicated AA. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) and determine whether appendicitis scores could predict complicated AA. Results There were 76 patients with a mean age of 29.1±13.0 years. Serositis was observed in 65% of the patients; mucosal ulceration was the most common microscopic finding, with a pathological diagnosis of AA in 58 (76.3%) patients. Rovsing's sign and the presence of phlegmon and granuloma were significantly different between those with and without complicated AA. The clinical prediction scores were not significantly different between the two groups. The Tzanakis and Ohmann scores were significant (cutoff: 6.5 and 7.25, p=0.001 and 0.01, respectively) in diagnosing AA (sensitivity/specificity of 98.3/66.7 and 98.3/94.4, respectively). With a cutoff of 5.75, the RIPASA score, with an AUC of 0.663 (p=0.09), showed the highest sensitivity (90.7) and specificity (76.6) for diagnosing complicated AA. Conclusion Diagnosing AA based solely on clinical presentation remains a challenge. This study showed that clinical scores such as those of Alvarado, RIPASA, Tzanakis, and Ohmann could not accurately predict complicated AA. Scoring systems without imaging and intraoperative diagnoses are not infallible; therefore, histopathological examination of the resected appendix is mandatory."

    "abstract": "Acute cholecystitis is a common general surgical emergency, accounting for 3-10 % of all patients attending with acute abdominal pain. International guidelines suggest that emergency cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated acute cholecystitis where feasible. There is a paucity of published data on the uptake of emergency cholecystectomy in Ireland. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of acute cholecystitis in Ireland and to establish the rate of emergency cholecystectomy performed. All patients with acute cholecystitis presenting to public hospitals in Ireland between January 2017 and July 2023 were identified using the National Quality Assurance and Improvement System (NQAIS). Data were collected on patient demographics, co-morbidities, length of stay, operative intervention, endoscopic intervention, critical care admissions, in-patient mortality, and readmissions. Propensity score matched analysis and logistic regression were performed to account for selection bias in comparing patients managed with cholecystectomy and those managed conservatively. 20,886 admission episodes were identified involving 17,958 patients. 3585 (20 %) patients underwent emergency cholecystectomy in total. 3436 (96 %) of these were performed laparoscopically, with 140 (4 %) requiring conversion to an open procedure, and common bile duct injuries occurring in 4 (0.1 %) of patients. In comparison to patients treated conservatively, patients who underwent cholecystectomy were younger (median 50 v 60 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be female (64 % v 55 % p < 0.001). Following propensity score matched analysis, those who had an emergency cholecystectomy had reduced length of stay (LOS) (median 5 days (IQR 3-8) v 6 days (interquartile range (IQR) 3-10), p < 0.001) and fewer readmissions to hospital (282 (8 %) v 492 (14 %), p < 0.001). On logistic regression, age >65 (OR 1.526), CCI >3 (OR 2.281) and non-operative management (OR 1.136) were significant risk factors for adverse outcome. Uptake of emergency cholecystectomy in Ireland remains low, and is carried out on a younger, fitter cohort of patients. In those patients, however, it is associated with improved outcomes for cholecystitis compared to conservative management, including shorter LOS and reduced readmission rates for matched cohorts."

    "abstract": "A volvulus refers to the torsion or rotational twisting of a portion of the gastrointestinal tract, with a predilection for impacting the caecum and sigmoid colon, often resulting in the development of bowel obstruction. The risk factors associated are old age, chronic fecal impaction, psychiatric disorders, colonic dysmotility, prior abdominal surgical procedures, diabetes, and Hirschsprung's disease. Elderly are most commonly affected with sigmoid volvulus but there are few cases among young adults that culminate in grave complications. Although it is rare, but young individuals presenting with acute abdomen secondary to sigmoid volvulus need urgent attention. To prevent more invasive surgical procedures, endoscopic detorsion is preferred nowadays with complete recovery of patients. We present a case of young female who was successfully managed with endoscopic detorsion. 27 years old Asian Pakistani female presented with worsening abdominal distention, constipation and vomiting since 2 days. On examination she was afebrile, vitally stable. Abdomen was distended, tympanic percussion with generalized tenderness. Abdominal radiograph was obtained which showed dilated bowel loops followed by Computed tomography of abdomen which was suggestive of Sigmoid volvulus causing intestinal obstruction. Patient was immediately moved to endoscopy unit and endoscopic detorsion of volvulus was done. For individuals who present with sigmoid volvulus and do not exhibit signs of peritonitis or colonic gangrene, the recommended course of action involves acute endoscopic detorsion, followed by scheduled surgical intervention. This case report emphasizes the significance of clinicians considering sigmoid volvulus as a rare but important cause when evaluating abdominal pain in young and otherwise healthy patients. A delay in diagnosis and treatment extending beyond 48 hours leads to colonic necrosis, amplifying the associated morbidity and mortality. Swift intervention is imperative to mitigate these complications and attain a conclusive remedy."

An ageing population, who often exhibit atypical symptoms and delayed presentations, challenge conventional diagnostic and treatment paradigms. This study aims to delineate disparities in presentation, management, and outcomes between elderly patients and younger adults suffering from acute appendicitis. This subgroup analysis forms part of ESTES SnapAppy, a time-bound multi-center prospective, observational cohort study. It includes patients aged 15 years and above who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy during a defined 90-day observational period across multiple centers. Statistical comparisons were performed using appropriate tests with significance set at p < 0.05. The study cohort comprised 521 elderly patients (≥65 years) and 4,092 younger adults (18-64 years). Elderly patients presented later (mean duration of symptoms: 7.88 vs. 3.56 days; p < 0.001) and frequently required computed tomography (CT) scans for diagnosis (86.1% vs. 54.0%; p < 0.001). The incidence of complicated appendicitis was higher in the elderly (46.7% vs. 20.7%; p < 0.001). Delays in surgical intervention were notable in the elderly (85.0% operated within 24 h vs. 88.7%; p = 0.018), with longer operative times (71.1 vs. 60.3 min; p < 0.001). Postoperative complications were significantly higher in the elderly (27.9% vs. 12.9%; p < 0.001), including severe complications (6.9% vs. 2.4%; p < 0.001) and prolonged hospital stays (7.9 vs. 3.6 days; p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Acute incarcerated paraesophageal hernias (PEH) have historically been considered a surgical emergency. Emergent operations have a higher rate of morbidity and mortality compared to elective surgery. Our institution has adopted a strategy of initial conservative management in patients presenting with acute obstruction from an incarcerated PEH who are clinically stable. Patients are given at least 24 h for their symptoms to improve (selective nasogastric decompression). If symptoms resolve, contrast on an upper GI study passes to the small bowel, and liquids are tolerated, patients are discharged with planned interval repair. We sought to characterize the outcomes of this interval surgical strategy for incarcerated PEH. A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients admitted to a single institution between October 2019 and September 2023 with an incarcerated PEH. Patients taken directly to surgery within 24 h were excluded. A total of 45 patients admitted with obstruction from an incarcerated PEH were identified. Ten patients (22%) were taken urgently to surgery due to clinical instability and were excluded. Of the remaining 35 patients, 23 (66%) resolved their obstruction with conservative non-operative management and were offered planned interval PEH repair (successful conservative management). In the successful conservative management cohort, there was one unplanned readmission before interval PEH repair. Average time between discharge and repair was 25 days. Complication rates did not differ in those who failed and in those who had a successful conservative management result. The cumulative length of stay for those who succeeded in conservative management (including days for the interval surgery) was equivalent with those who underwent PEH repair during the index admission. A trial of conservative management in clinically stable patients with symptomatic incarcerated PEH appears to be safe and often avoids emergent repair without increasing perioperative complications or total days in the hospital."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is widely recognized as the prevailing abdominal surgical emergency globally, exhibiting an annual incidence ranging from 96.5 to 100 cases per 100,000 adults. Conversely, situs inversus totalis is a rare anatomical anomaly characterized by the complete reversal of the chest and abdominal organs, occurring in approximately 1 out of every 10,000 to 50,000 individuals. 53-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with a complaint of diffuse abdominal pain of colic nature that had persisted for 5 days. The patient referred systemic hypertension, pre-diabetes mellitus type 2, and situs inversus as relevant medical history. A laparotomy procedure was conducted, revealing a perforated appendix located in the right hypochondrium. Additionally, the patient exhibited situs inversus totalis, with the colon positioned in its normal anatomical location. Due to the low incidence of situs inversus totalis, in cases similar to the one presented, the utilization of image studies and laboratory studies is imperative for accurate diagnosis. In the face of diagnostic suspicions and inconclusive paraclinical studies, the most effective approach is to pursue surgical examination and intervention, preferably utilizing laparoscopic techniques. la apendicitis aguda es la urgencia quirúrgica abdominal más frecuente en el mundo, con una incidencia anual de 96.5 a 100 casos por 100,000 adultos.

    "abstract": "To investigate the emergency response capabilities of cardiovascular surgical nurses, analyze their correlation with self-efficacy and coping styles, and summarize targeted intervention measures. A total of 243 cardiovascular surgical nurses from comprehensive tertiary Grade A hospitals in Jiangsu Province were selected using convenience sampling from October to November 2023. Participants were surveyed using a general information questionnaire, an emergency response capability assessment scale for operating room nurses, a general self-efficacy scale, and a simplified coping style scale. The total scores were 114.77±12.39 for emergency response capability, 2.69±0.58 for self-efficacy, 2.02±0.54 for positive coping style, and 1.16±0.53 for negative coping style. Pearson correlation analysis showed that emergency response capability was positively correlated with self-efficacy and positive coping styles and negatively correlated with negative coping styles (all P<0.05). Optimal scaling regression analysis indicated seven factors; age, years of work, professional level, title, self-efficacy, positive coping style, and negative coping style, which could explain 39.0% of the variation in emergency response capability (all P<0.05). The emergency response capabilities of cardiovascular surgical nurses are moderately high and closely related to their self-efficacy and coping styles. Emergency rescue training for cardiovascular surgical nurses should aim at enhancing self-efficacy and positive coping styles by, for example, setting clear training goals, focusing on individual differences, fostering of active learning, and stimulating their intrinsic motivation to enhance their emergency response capabilities. These changes will lead to more organized and efficient cardiovascular surgical emergency work."

    "abstract": "Acquired angioedema (AAE), a rare cause of adult-onset non-urticarial mucocutaneous angioedema, can present as acute abdomen, a frequent complaint in the emergency room (ER), often leading to unnecessary and potentially harmful procedures. We report a 47-year-old hypertense male, controlled with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), who presented in the ER with progressively worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and a radiologic workup revealing small intestine thickening, initially diagnosed with ACEI-induced angioedema. However, further investigation revealed low serum levels of C4, C1q, and C1 inhibitors, with an abnormal function of the latter, favoring the diagnosis of AAE instead. The frequent association of this condition with lymphoproliferative disorders encouraged further studies, which unveiled a monoclonal gammopathy IgM/Kappa, representing an increased risk of Waldenström macroglobulinemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. AAE should be regarded as an important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute abdomen in the ER, especially when more common causes are excluded. A correct and early diagnosis may represent a chance for a better prognosis of underlying diseases. O angioedema adquirido (AA), causa rara de angioedema mucocutâneo não urticariforme de início tardio, pode ter como apresentação inicial abdómen agudo, motivo frequente de admissão no serviço de urgência (SU), promovendo frequentemente procedimentos desnecessários e potencialmente prejudiciais. Um homem de 47 anos, hipertenso e controlado com um inibidor da enzima conversora de angiotensina (IECA), recorreu ao SU por um quadro de dor abdominal com agravamento progressivo, náuseas e vómitos. A investigação radiológica inicial revelou espessamento do intestino delgado, culminando num diagnóstico preliminar de angioedema induzido por IECA. No entanto, uma investigação mais aprofundada em regime ambulatório revelou níveis séricos reduzidos de C4, C1q e de inibidor de C1, com função anormal deste último, favorecendo o diagnóstico de AA. A associação frequente desta condição com distúrbios linfoproliferativos incentivou investigação adicional, que revelou uma gamopatia monoclonal IgM/Kappa, representando um risco aumentado de macroglobulinemia de Waldenström, linfoma não-Hodgkin e mieloma múltiplo. O AA deve ser considerado um diagnóstico diferencial de abdómen agudo, principalmente após exclusão de causas mais frequentes. Um diagnóstico precoce pode contribuir para um melhor prognóstico da patologia subjacente."

    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency requiring rapid recognition in the emergency department to minimize morbidity and mortality. It is most commonly caused by traumatic extremity fractures, which account for about 75% of cases. Atraumatic acute compartment syndrome is substantially less common with current evidence mostly limited to case reports, and diagnosis is made more challenging by the absence of an obvious traumatic injury. We present the case of a young adult female patient with IgA vasculitis who developed recurrent, atraumatic acute compartment syndrome and was successfully managed with prompt fasciotomy. This is the first case of spontaneous intramuscular hemorrhage, a rare sequela of IgA vasculitis, leading to recurrent, atraumatic acute compartment syndrome. This case highlights the importance of both a thorough physical exam and maintaining a high suspicion for acute compartment syndrome in the absence of injury to ensure patients receive prompt surgical evaluation for definitive care."

This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of early diagnosis and management of Fournier gangrene at KAMC in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at KAMC, Saudi Arabia. The study population included all adult patients diagnosed with Fournier gangrene between 2015 and 2022. Data analysis was performed using RStudio (RStudio, Boston, MA). Frequencies and percentages were used to present categorical data, while medians and interquartile ranges were used to express numerical variables. The study included 41 patients with Fournier gangrene, the majority (95.12%) being male with a median age of 60 years. The most prevalent comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (85.37%). Ten patients presented to the hospital with sepsis, two of whom were in shock. Within 90 days of admission, two of them had expired. This resulted in a 20% mortality rate among septic patients. The mean FGSI in patients who had died during hospital stays was approximately two times the mean in surviving patients (8.17 and 4.32, respectively). The most utilized imaging study was a CT scan (70.7%). Most patients had undergone multiple debridements (87.7%). The median number of debridements per patient was three, and the interval between each debridement was three days. The most frequent tissue culture finding was mixed organisms, followed by Escherichia coli. Regarding empiric antibiotics, tazocin was the most used, accounting for 22.0%. The most frequently performed adjunctive procedure was the placement of a suprapubic catheter, accounting for 41.5%. Roughly 43.90% required a blood transfusion. Within 90 days of admission, six patients had died, which makes the mortality rate 14.6%. Four of them had died within 30 days of admission (9.76%). Fournier gangrene is a surgical emergency that requires prompt attention and resuscitation, antibiotic therapy, and surgical debridement. The study identified the demographic factors of patients who presented with the disease and provided the incidence, mortality rate, and outcomes of the disease. It also identified specifics of the pharmacological and surgical management and hospital courses."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. It is commonly caused by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen due to fecaliths, tumors, or lymphoid hyperplasia. For over a century, appendectomy has been the primary treatment for acute appendicitis. Abraham Groves performed the first open appendectomy in 1883. In 1983, Kurt Semm completed the first laparoscopic appendectomy, heralding a new era in appendectomy. However, appendectomy is associated with certain complications and a rate of negative appendectomies. Studies have suggested controversy over the impact of appendectomy on the development of inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson's disease, but an increasing number of studies indicate a possible positive correlation between appendectomy and colorectal cancer, gallstones, and cardiovascular disease. With the recognition that the appendix is not a vestigial organ and the advancement of endoscopic te-chnology, Liu proposed the endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy. It is an effective minimally invasive alternative for treating uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Our team has developed an appendoscope with a disposable digital imaging system operated through the biopsy channel of a colonoscope and successfully applied it in the treatment of appendicitis. This article provides an overview of the progress in endoscopic treatment for acute appendicitis and offers a new perspective on the future direction of appendiceal disease treatment."

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with an enterectomy of the invaginated segment. The histopathological and immunohistochemical results of the surgical specimen confirmed the presence of a small bowel leiomyoma. This case highlights the importance of a detailed clinical evaluation of patients with an intestinal obstruction who seek emergency care. The cause of intestinal obstruction is a diagnostic challenge due to the numerous pathologies that can lead to the development of the condition. Guided anamnesis, detailed physical examinations, and accurate subsidiary exams that do not delay diagnosis are the cornerstones of emergency room care. Knowing the ideal time to refer the patient to the operating room requires knowledge and practice. The patient reported in this article with jejunal leiomyoma as a cause of intestinal intussusception is surprising for its rarity and illustrates the range of pathologies that can lead to intestinal obstruction."

Our aim in this study is to describe the clinical, laboratory, and computed tomography (CT) findings to facilitate the objective identification of SBO patients in need of operative treatment in this patient population. This retrospective study included 340 patients hospitalized due to a preliminary diagnosis of ileus. Retrieved data of patients included age, gender, comorbidities, previous hospitalization due to ileus, surgical history, physical examination findings, complete blood count and biochemistry test results, and CT findings at admission. The study included 180 (52.9%) male and 160 (47.1%) female patients. Treatment was conservative in 216 patients and surgery in 124 patients. Of the patients included in the study, 36.4% needed surgery. Of the female patients, 38.90% received conservative treatment and 61.30% underwent surgery. Adhesions were the most common cause of obstruction in operated patients (43.50%). We have found that female gender, vomiting, guarding, rebound, C-reactive protein levels above 75 mg/L, increased bowel diameter, and a transition zone on CT images indicate a strong need for surgery, but a history of previous hospitalization for ileus may show that surgery may not be the best option.

A late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic hernia shows a variety of clinical manifestations, and the preoperative clinical course is variable. We herein report a pediatric case of late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic hernia diagnosed as acute abdomen. A 5-year-old boy was brought to our hospital because of herniation of the intestine into the left thoracic cavity, which was observed on radiography performed for abdominal pain. Enhanced computed tomography showed herniation of the small intestine and colon into the left thoracic cavity. Emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed based on the diagnosis of left diaphragmatic hernia. The entire small intestine and part of the colon herniated from the posterolateral defect of the diaphragm. We were able to retract the herniated intestine back into the abdomen but confirmed that the diaphragmatic defect and closure of the defect seemed to be technically challenging via laparoscopy; therefore, we converted the procedure to open laparotomy. The diaphragmatic defect was directly closed with interrupted sutures, and the thoracic cavity was degassed. Postoperatively, the left lung was found to be poorly expanded, but pulmonary hypoplasia was not evident in this case. We herein report a pediatric case of late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic hernia diagnosed as abdominal pain. Late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic hernias present with a wide variety of symptoms; therefore, it is important to be reminded of these conditions and check chest radiographs in children presenting with acute or chronic respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms of unknown etiology."

A total of 315 consecutive patients who presented with a presumptive diagnosis of acute appendicitis and were planned to undergo appendectomy were studied. All the studied patients had diagnostic sonography and underwent the RIPASA scoring system. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of RIPASA and ultrasound results with intraoperative gross examinations. The mean age of the participants was 27.4 ± 11.5 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1. The concordance between ultrasound and RIPASA for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was 93.6%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of RIPASA were 96.2%, 30.8%, 93.9%, and 42.1%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ultrasound were 95.3%, 27.8%, 95.6%, and 26.3%, respectively. White cell count and RIPASA scores were weakly correlated with intraoperative stages of acute appendicitis, r(313) = 0.18, p = 0.001, and r(313) = 0.129, p = 0.022, respectively. The rate of a negative appendectomy was 6%. RIPASA and ultrasound had equivalent performance in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. In both cases, the rate of negative appendectomy was low enough to validate RIPASA for clinical practice in low-income institutions where sonographic diagnosis by a conventionally trained radiologist is not available."

After adequately resuscitating the patients, various surgical procedures were performed based on the intraoperative conditions of the bowel. Patients were assessed postoperatively for the duration of their hospital stay, postoperative complications, and surgical recovery. There was a male preponderance (n=55), with a median age of 50 (18-90) years. Abdominal discomfort was the most frequent symptom, necessitating a hospital visit (97.9%, n= 86), followed by nausea (85.2%, n= 75), constipation (78.1%, n=69), and abdominal distension (51.1%, n=45). Ileal strictures (18.2%, n=16) were the most common etiology, followed by postoperative adhesions (14.8%, n=13) and bands (13.6%, n=12), of which 76.4% (n=9) had past surgical history.

Surgery is the main treatment modality and patient's comorbidites impacts perioperative morbidity and surgical outcomes. Even after surgery, resuscitation efforts should continue. While empiric antibiotics are recommended, the role of empiric anti-fungal treatment is unclear due to a lack of scientific evidence. This literature review demonstrated a paucity of studies evaluating the role of empiric anti-fungals in PPUs, and with conflicting results. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of patient demographics and underlying surgical pathology (PPUs vs. any gastrointestinal perforation), type of anti-fungal agent, timing of administration and duration of use. Other considerations include the need to differentiate between fungal colonization vs. invasive fungal infection. Despite positive fungal isolates from fluid culture, it is important for clinical judgement to identify the right group of patients for anti-fungal administration. Biochemistry investigations including new fungal biomarkers may help to guide management. Multidisciplinary discussions may help in decision making for this conundrum. Moving forward, further research may be conducted to select the right group of patients who may benefit from empiric anti-fungal use."

    "abstract": "Acute small intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency in the sub-Saharan region. Over the decades, complicated inguinal hernias have been identified as a leading cause. However, we observed from our clinical practice that complicated inguinal hernias were not the most common etiology. This study aimed to evaluate the common etiology of acute small bowel obstruction in the study center and compare our findings with that from other centers and existing literature. This was a retrospective, cross sectional study carried out over a period of five years (January 2017 to December 2021). This study looked at the patients presenting with acute, mechanical, small bowel obstruction that did not respond to conservative treatment in our hospital facility. Relevant information were extracted from patients' clinical details and entered into the proforma prepared for this study. A total of 147 patients were recruited into this study out of which 85(57.8%) were males and 62 (42.2%) were females (M:F=1.44:1). Majority (80.3%) of the patients that presented with post-operative bowel adhesion had previous appendectomy. Simple bowel obstruction was seen in 93 (63.3%) patients while strangulated obstruction and gangrenous bowel were seen in 26 (17.7%) patients and 22 (15.0%) patients respectively. Majority (47.6%) of the patients had adhesiolysis done while others had bowel resection. The common cause of acute small bowel obstruction as observed in this study is post-operative adhesions arising from previous appendectomy and laparotomies.

    "title": "Trends and levels of the global, regional, and national burden of appendicitis between 1990 and 2021: findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that poses a large clinical and economic burden. Understanding the global burden of appendicitis is crucial for evaluating unmet needs and implementing and scaling up intervention services to reduce adverse health outcomes. This study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the global, regional, and national burden of appendicitis, by age and sex, from 1990 to 2021. Vital registration and verbal autopsy data, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), and demographic estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) were used to estimate cause-specific mortality rates (CSMRs) for appendicitis. Incidence data were extracted from insurance claims and inpatient discharge sources and analysed with disease modelling meta-regression, version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1). Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by combining death counts with standard life expectancy at the age of death. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were estimated by multiplying incidence estimates by an average disease duration of 2 weeks and a disability weight for abdominal pain. YLLs and YLDs were summed to estimate disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). In 2021, the global age-standardised mortality rate of appendicitis was 0·358 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·311-0·414) per 100 000. Mortality rates ranged from 1·01 (0·895-1·13) per 100 000 in central Latin America to 0·054 (0·0464-0·0617) per 100 000 in high-income Asia Pacific. The global age-standardised incidence rate of appendicitis in 2021 was 214 (174-274) per 100 000, corresponding to 17 million (13·8-21·6) new cases. The incidence rate was the highest in high-income Asia Pacific, at 364 (286-475) per 100 000 and the lowest in western sub-Saharan Africa, at 81·4 (63·9-109) per 100 000. The global age-standardised rates of mortality, incidence, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs due to appendicitis decreased steadily between 1990 and 2021, with the largest reduction in mortality and YLL rates. The global annualised rate of decline in the DALY rate was greatest in children younger than the age of 10 years. Although mortality rates due to appendicitis decreased in all regions, there were large regional variations in the temporal trend in incidence. Although the global age-standardised incidence rate of appendicitis has steadily decreased between 1990 and 2021, almost half of GBD regions saw an increase of greater than 10% in their age-standardised incidence rates. Slow but promising progress has been observed in reducing the overall burden of appendicitis in all regions. However, there are important geographical variations in appendicitis incidence and mortality, and the relationship between these measures suggests that many people still do not have access to quality health care. As the incidence of appendicitis is rising in many parts of the world, countries should prepare their health-care infrastructure for timely, high-quality diagnosis and treatment. Given the risk that improved diagnosis may counterintuitively drive apparent rising trends in incidence, these efforts should be coupled with improved data collection, which will also be crucial for understanding trends and developing targeted interventions.

    "title": "Uterine leiomyoma torsion: A rare cause of acute abdominal pain.",
    "abstract": "Leiomyoma torsion is an incredibly rare entity. Diagnosis is frequently intraoperative due to poor correlation between clinical symptoms and radiological findings. We report a case of a twisted uterine leimyoma diagnosed intraoperatively. Our patient was 46 years old, nulliparous woman, presented to the emergency department with three days of acute pelvic pain. On physical examination, a firm and tender pelvic mass was palpable, extending below the umbilicus, suggestive of uterine origin. Laboratory investigations revealed an inflammatory response. Ultrasound identified a large abdomino-pelvic mass adherent to the right side of the uterus, with no detectable blood flow on Doppler examination. Given the diagnostic uncertainty, exploratory laparoscopy was performed. The diagnosis of a pedunculated Leiomyoma torsion with acute appendicitis was confirmed. Initially we performed a fibroid detorsion then a myomectomy and appendectomy were performed. The torsion of the vascular pedicle of a subserous leiomyoma can lead to ischemic gangrene and peritonitis, which can cause mortality. The risk factors that contribute to the fibroid torsion include the size, the stalk of the pedunculated myoma that must be thin and long in order for it to undergo rotation and torsion. There are no specific clinical signs or imaging modalities that reliably indicate the diagnosis. A diagnostic laparoscopy is most often indicated in case of diagnostic doubt. Surgery may consist in myomectomy or hysterectomy. It is important to consider the possibility of torsed leiomyoma in the differential diagnosis in any woman presenting with an intra-abdominal and pelvic mass with acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Malignant transformation of ovarian teratomas is rare, provoking peritonitis and death are exceedingly rare. We present the case of a 75-year-old woman who was admitted to the emergency department for severe abdominal pain with septic shock due to acute peritonitis caused by perforation of the ovarian mass. Teratomas are germ cell tumors usually composed of multiple cell types derived from one or more of the three germ layers. Pathologically, malignant transformation of ovarian dermoid cysts is rare due to the thickness of the capsule, spontaneous rupture is a very rare complication, acute peritonitis presents with features of acute abdomen or shock, treatment is essentially surgical and includes at least unilateral adnexectomy, complete exploration of the pelvis and abdominal cavity, peritoneal washing and/or sampling of any ascites. In conclusion, although ovarian teratoma with granulomatous peritonitis is rare, rupture leading to generalised acute peritonitis further worsens the prognosis. Which will ensure correct management that will provide a good outcome with less complications."

    "title": "Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome in a Recently Abstinent Chronic User: Assessment and Intervention.",
    "abstract": "Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) is a condition characterized by episodic bursts of vomiting and abdominal pain linked to cannabis use. The clinical picture mimics an acute abdomen and is often misdiagnosed, especially when the patient avoids reporting their cannabis use for legal reasons. We report on the case of a 33-year-old man that was brought to the emergency room with a history of 3 days of non-bloody, non-projectile, and non-bilious brownish vomit, coupled with severe epigastric and left hypochondriac pain, and a slight fever. He was a daily cannabis user for several years and had stopped using a week or so before the onset of the symptoms, as he was traveling to a country with more restrictive cannabis laws. His condition deteriorated rapidly, followed by emergency room attendance, thorough diagnostic work-up, and unsuccessful interventions, including intravenous treatment with the anti-emetic Ondansetron. The patient was referred to a psychiatrist after a suspected psychogenic etiology by the medical team. The history was suggestive of CHS and also included anxious, depressed mood with 'brain fog'. The abdominal pain was the most severe complaint. A combination of tramadol, promethazine, and mirtazapine given on an outpatient basis led to full recovery within 10 days. CHS can occur soon after the interruption of chronic cannabis use and overlap with withdrawal symptom. A combination of anti-histaminergic, opioid-based medication, and antidepressant mirtazapine seemed an effective treatment of CHS, which resulted in a relatively quick recovery. Синдром каннабиноидной гиперемезии (СКГ) — состояние, связанное с употреблением каннабиса, характеризующееся эпизодическими приступами рвоты и болью в животе. Клиническая картина имитирует синдром острого живота. Зачастую ставится ошибочный диагноз, особенно если пациент по юридическим причинам избегает раскрытия информации об употреблении им каннабиса. Представлен случай СКГ у 33- летнего мужчины, которого доставили в отделение неотложной помощи с жалобами на рвоту в течение трех дней (не « фонтаном », без примеси крови, желчи, коричневатого цвета). Также отмечались сильная боль в эпигастрии и левом подреберье, небольшое повышение температуры тела. Из анамнеза известно, что пациент на протяжении нескольких лет ежедневно употреблял каннабис. Примерно за неделю до появления вышеуказанных симптомов пациент прекратил употребление из - за нахождения в стране со строгими законами в отношении каннабиса. В связи с быстрым ухудшением состояния пациент обратился в отделение неотложной помощи, где было проведено всестороннее обследование, а также предприняты неудачные попытки купировать симптомы. Внутривенное назначение ондансетрона (противорвотный препарат) также не дало эффекта. Врачебная бригада заподозрила психогенную природу состояния, в связи с чем пациент был направлен на консультацию к психиатру. Анамнестические сведения указывали на вероятность СКГ, кроме того у пациента наблюдались тревога, подавленность, ощущение « тумана в голове », тумана в голове 10 дней лечения вся симптоматика купировалась. СГК может возникнуть вскоре после прекращения длительного употребления каннабиса и совпадать с синдромом отмены. Комбинированное лечение с использованием антигистаминных, опиоидных препаратов и антидепрессанта миртазапина было эффективным в отношении СКГ и привело к относительно быстрому улучшению состояния пациента."

    "abstract": "Surgery remains the mainstay in treating intussusception in developing nations. A correspondingly high bowel resection rate exists despite a shift to nonoperative reduction in high-income countries. We aimed to study the clinical profile of the patients with intussusception presenting to our hospital and to assess the clinical and radiological predictors of success or failure of nonoperative management of intussusception. This prospective study was conducted in the Department of Pediatric Surgery over a period of 3 years and included a total of 118 patients who presenting to our emergency division with features suggestive of intussusception and were managed accordingly either with hydrostatic reduction or by surgical intervention. We observed that the majority of the patients were males (65.5%). The mean age was 13.54 months. Intermittent pain was the most common symptom. Both pain and vomiting did not affect the outcome. Lab parameters like raised total leukocyte counts (TLC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate levels were significantly associated with failure of hydrostatic reduction. Patients with air fluid levels on X-ray were more likely to end up in surgery. Ultrasound findings of bowel wall edema, aperistaltic gut loops and a pathological lead point was associated with failure of hydrostatic reduction as well. The overall success rate of hydrostatic reduction was 85.5%. Hydrostatic reduction of intussusception is a safe and effective method of management of intussusception whenever indicated. Factors that might reduce the chance of its success include continuous pain, irritability, tenderness, deranged lab parameters like TLC, CRP and lactate levels, air fluid levels on X-ray, bowel wall edema, aperistalsis and the presence of a lead point.

Moreover, endometriosis-related complications are rare, and the disease is often undiagnosed. We report a case of acute perforation of the cecum and appendix during pregnancy (35 weeks of gestation) caused by a previously unknown, deep infiltrating endometriosis with focal ulceration of the affected bowel wall, which sonographically seemed to be acute appendicitis. Despite the relatively low risk, clinicians should be aware of possible endometriosis-associated complications in pregnancy with potentially life-threatening events, even in previously unknown endometriosis. Further studies should evaluate intestinal complications during pregnancy in relation to previous treatment of intestinal endometriosis (conservative vs. surgical)."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdomen worldwide. The complications associated with it can sometimes be unpredictable and pose a dilemma in the management of such complications. A case of 18 year female with complaints of right iliac fossa pain and vomiting was diagnosed clinically as acute appendicitis and underwent emergency open appendectomy where a cecal perforation was encountered intra-operatively for which a Modified Graham's Patch Repair was done. Acute appendicitis can sometimes present with complications like perforation, among which cecal perforation is rare and difficult to diagnose in the initial setting. Perforated appendicitis or colon can increase morbidity and mortality significantly. High degree of suspicion and early surgical approach can lead to identification of rare complications, which can still pose a surgical dilemma on the approach of management. Cecal perforation in suspected acute appendicitis is a rarely encountered intra operative complication. Management approaches can range from less invasive suture with omental patch repair to more invasive right hemicolectomy."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a typical surgical emergency worldwide and one of the common causes of surgical acute abdomen in the elderly. Accurately diagnosing and differentiating acute appendicitis can assist clinicians in formulating a scientific and reasonable treatment plan and providing high-quality medical services for the elderly. In this study, we validated and analyzed the different performances of various machine learning models based on the analysis of clinical data, so as to construct a simple, fast, and accurate estimation method for the diagnosis of early acute appendicitis. The dataset of this paper was obtained from the medical data of elderly patients with acute appendicitis attending the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Chinese Medicine from January 2012 to January 2022, including 196 males (60.87%) and 126 females (39.13%), including 103 (31.99%) patients with complicated appendicitis and 219 (68.01%) patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. By comparing and analyzing the prediction results of the models implemented by nine different machine learning techniques (LR, CART, RF, SVM, Bayes, KNN, NN, FDA, and GBM), we found that the GBM algorithm gave the optimal results and that sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, precision, recall, F1 and brier are 0.9167, 0.9739, 0.9429, 0.9613, 0.9429, 0.9167, 0.9296, and 0.05649, respectively. The GBM model prediction results are interpreted using the SHAP technology framework. Calibration and Decision curve analysis also show that the machine learning model proposed in this paper has some clinical and economic benefits. Finally, we developed the Shiny application for complicated appendicitis diagnosis to assist clinicians in quickly and effectively recognizing patients with complicated appendicitis (CA) and uncomplicated appendicitis (UA), and to formulate a more reasonable and scientific clinical plan for acute appendicitis patient population promptly."

We present a case of spontaneous perforation of the CHD in a boy in his middle childhood, alongside a review of relevant literature. The patient presented with acute abdomen and pyobiliary peritonitis, for which a hollow viscus perforation was suspected. An emergent laparotomy revealed a 0.5 cm CHD perforation. Surgical intervention involved T-tube insertion and drainage, leading to a successful recovery. This case underscores the challenge of preoperative diagnosis, necessitating prompt exploration after initial resuscitation. There is a need for clinical vigilance and tailored surgical approaches."

Prenatal diagnosis can be made by simple obstetric ultrasound and postnatal by plain abdominal x-ray to plan a multidisciplinary approach to reduce morbidity and neonatal mortality. Atresia can occur anywhere along the intestines and is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in neonates. Jejunoileal atresia (JIA) is a rare disease occurring in 2.1 per 10,000 live births. Type 3b jejunoileal atresia occurs in 11% of all small bowel atresia. We present three cases of type 3b jejunoileal atresia. They were all missed by prenatal ultrasonography, and presented with features of intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis was confirmed by plain abdominal x-rays and ultrasound, followed by laparotomy. Postoperative care was given in the neonatal unit according to local protocols. One recovered, however, two succumbed from neonatal infection. Jejunoileal atresia requires surgery and long postoperative care, with outcomes associated with numerous prognostic factors including multidisciplinary care and neonatal intensive care. Jejunoileal atresia is less commonly associated with other congenital anomalies, unlike duodenal atresia. Efforts are needed to scale up prenatal diagnosis of jejunoileal atresia, and therefore to plan for appropriate care after delivery. Also, further studies are needed to understand neonatal sepsis in the postoperative period and ways to improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Richter's hernia is a relatively uncommon type of hernia that can lead to severe clinical consequences if left unaddressed. The definitive treatment involves the reduction and repair of the hernia defect, with various surgical approaches available, including open transabdominal, inguinal, obturator, and laparoscopic techniques, depending on the size of the defect and the viability of the involved bowel. A 29-year-old female patient presented with Richter's hernia, a rare type of hernia, and underwent surgical intervention to release the incarcerated bowel loop and resect the necrotic segment. The case emphasizes the need to consider Richter's hernia in atypical hernia presentations to prevent severe complications. Richter's hernia is a distinct type of hernia characterized by the entrapment of a portion of the intestinal circumference, often leading to rapid onset of gangrene without causing intestinal obstruction. The diverse anatomical locations of Richter's hernias, including the rare prevascular variant, emphasize the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for this condition, particularly in the context of laparoscopic interventions and atypical hernia presentations. Early recognition and prompt referral for appropriate imaging investigations are essential to prevent the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this notoriously challenging-to-diagnose condition, and a heightened awareness and a comprehensive diagnostic approach are crucial to effectively identify and address this rare but potentially life-threatening surgical emergency."

To assess the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic's effect on ICU admissions in a tertiary hospital, examining differences in patient characteristics, organ support requirements, reason for admission, mortality rates and length of ICU stay. This retrospective cohort study compared ICU patient data at a tertiary hospital during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (26 March 2020 to 20 September 2020) with the same period in 2019. Patient admissions (p=0.39) and severity of illness (p=0.27 adults; p=0.92 paediatrics) showed no differences across the study period. Similarly, no differences were observed for underlying chronic conditions between the two years. Adult trauma admissions significantly declined, specifically those related to road traffic accidents (RR 0.63). Admissions for acute infectious conditions, including respiratory infections, sepsis, urosepsis, septic arthritis and gastroenteritis significantly declined in both adults (RR 0.50) and paediatric admissions (RR 0.25). During the lockdown period, the length of stay (LOS) decreased for adults, but mortality rates remained unchanged across the study period. The paediatric mortality rate decreased during the lockdown period (p=0.004). There was no reduction in SARS-CoV-2-negative ICU admissions during the 2020 lockdown period compared with the preceding year, likely due to chronic resource limitations. We found a decrease in acute trauma and acute infectious illness admissions, while acute surgical emergency admissions increased. These findings suggest that lockdown orders may have affected admission patterns, aiding in future pandemic planning. The study highlights the chronic shortage of critical care resources in South Africa and aids with future pandemic preparedness and planning in a resource limited setting."

History of intake of spicy food, prolonged starvation, history of NSAID use were common among them. Majority of the patients had history of pain abdomen in the past suggesting of PUD and history of taking variety group of acid reducing agents. Most of them presented with epigastric pain, vomiting, abdominal distension along with other signs of peritonitis. Obliteration of liver dullness and free gas under right dome of diaphragm was also noted in large proportion among them. Majority of cases were found positive for H. pylori on Histology (85%), followed by rapid urease test (RUT) (80%) and a positivity of 72.5% and 68.8% on serum IgG and IgA antibody respectively. Rapid Urease Test was more sensitive as well as specific in diagnosing of H. pylori than antibody detection test. Early detection of H. pylori infection and treatment with potent anti H. pylori therapy postoperatively has been found to be adequate."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen due to incarcerated umbilical hernia is a surgical emergency. Acute abdomen secondary to gynaecological conditions is not uncommon. However, acute abdomen due to incarceration of a gynaecological tumour in an umbilical hernia is rare. A 25-year-old nullipara was admitted to the accident and emergency unit with a history of recurrent lower abdominal pain and abdominal swelling for 4 weeks. Pain worsened within the last 24 h necessitating presentation. Examination revealed a low-grade pyrexia, tachypnoea, an umbilical swelling with generalised abdominal tenderness, and a pelvic mass more in the right iliac fossa. Bedside abdomino-pelvic ultrasound scan confirmed bilateral adnexal masses with features suggestive of mature teratoma. A diagnosis of acute abdomen secondary to ovarian tumour accident was made. An emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a huge right ovarian tumour incarcerated in an umbilical hernia. She had bilateral ovarian cystectomy and herniorrhaphy. Gynaecological tumours presenting as incarcerated or strangulated hernias are extremely rare but can be a cause of acute abdomen in women."

    "abstract": "Critical care, emergency medicine, and surgical trainees frequently perform surgical and Seldinger-technique tube thoracostomy, thoracentesis, and thoracic ultrasound. However, approaches to teaching these skills are highly heterogeneous. Over 10 years, we have developed a standardized, multidisciplinary curriculum to teach these procedures. Emergency medicine residents, surgical residents, and critical care fellows, all in the first year of their respective programs, underwent training in surgical and Seldinger chest tube placement and securement, thoracentesis, and thoracic ultrasound. The curriculum included preworkshop instructional videos and 45-minute in-person practice stations (3.5 hours total). Sessions were co-led by faculty from emergency medicine, thoracic surgery, and pulmonary/critical care who performed real-time formative assessment with standardized procedural steps. Postcourse surveys assessed learners' confidence before versus after the workshop in each procedure, learners' evaluations of faculty by station and specialty, and the workshop overall. One hundred twenty-three trainees completed course evaluations, demonstrating stable and positive responses from learners of different backgrounds taught by a multidisciplinary group of instructors, as well as statistically significant improvement in learner confidence in each procedure. Over time, we have made incremental changes to our curriculum based on feedback from instructors and learners. We have developed a unique curriculum designed, revised, and taught by a multidisciplinary faculty over many years to teach a unified approach to the performance of common chest procedures to surgical, emergency medicine, and critical care trainees. Our curriculum can be readily adapted to the needs of institutions that desire a standardized, multidisciplinary approach to thoracic procedural education."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective surgeries including hernia repairs, were postponed, or cancelled completely. However, it has been stated previously that the volume of surgical emergency hernia repairs did not drop during this period. Due to the disruption in elective surgeries, waiting lists have increased rapidly, causing a suspected treatment delay. To gain improved insight in preoperative patient prioritization, the aim of this multicenter study was to track volumes of hernia surgery before, during and after the pandemic to investigate for a shift from elective towards emergency hernia surgery. A retrospective study using hernia databases from four regional hospitals to account for altered referral patterns (elective versus emergent), capturing patients' admissions and surgery times for both groin and ventral hernia repair was conducted. Study period was predefined from March 2019 to March 2023. Data are presented as descriptive statistics. During the historic period, 106 of 2267 hernia surgeries (4.7%) performed were defined as emergency repairs. During the pandemic, 3864 elective surgeries were executed, of which 213(5.5%) emergencies. During the current period, the portion of emergencies dropped to 4.9% (110 emergency hernia repairs); (p = 0.039). A non-significant increase in emergent incisional hernia repair during the pandemic period was found chronologically 9.9%, 11.8% and 11.6% emergent repairs(p = 0.75). There were no statistically significant differences across the hernia types in elective versus urgent rate.

Regionwide data showed a 15% decline in hernia repairs during the pandemic compared to historical levels, with an 0.8% increase in emergent repairs. Surgery rates are still convalescent after the pandemic, with a persistent proportion of emergent surgeries. These numbers emphasize the challenges in selecting patient whose hernia repair should not be postponed."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis, characterized by inflammation and obstruction of the appendiceal lumen, is a common surgical emergency often attributed to various factors. We present the case of an 18-year-old female who developed retrocecal appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma, a rare occurrence with significant diagnostic challenges. Initial symptoms mimicked upper abdominal trauma, evolving to classic signs of appendicitis within hours. Despite a negative pre-trauma history of abdominal pain, clinical evaluation led to a suspicion of appendicitis. Contrast-enhanced CT scan confirmed the thickening of the cecal appendix, prompting urgent surgical intervention. An open appendectomy revealed a congested retrocecal appendix, supporting the diagnosis. Our case underscores the importance of considering trauma as a potential trigger for appendicitis, especially in the absence of typical pre-trauma symptoms. Diagnostic criteria for post-trauma appendicitis are evolving, and we underscore a comprehensive clinical assessment alongside imaging modalities. While surgical management remains standard, newer approaches like endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy warrant exploration. Further research is essential to refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this uncommon presentation, ensuring timely intervention and improved patient outcomes."

The common clinical manifestations of a malignant omental tumor are abdominal mass and pain. We report on a woman 38 years old who came to the hospital's emergency department with a finding consisting of intestinal obstruction (abdominal pain, constipation, abdominal distention, and vomiting), and during a clinical examination a mass was discovered in the lower half of her abdomen. She had been experiencing these symptoms for three days before her arrival. During a clinical examination, a large size, hard mobile mass was discovered in the lower half of her abdomen. The patient underwent an abdominal CT scan which indicated the presence of a sizable, soft tissue mass located within the abdominal and pelvic region, exerting pressure on the small bowel loops, with mild free ascites. Due to the patient's acute abdomen, an exploration laparotomy was performed, revealing a large mass in the omentum measuring 20×20×10 cm and weighing 3 kg. The mass, along with the omentum, was completely removed, and histopathology confirmed a malignant hemangiopericytoma."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is a diagnostic problem that requires immediate care and treatment for surgeons and gynecologists. The causes of abdominal pain in women of childbearing age range from benign and temporary to potentially life threatening. Rare etiologies such as spontaneous ruptured endometrioma are often not included in the radar of diagnosis due to their rarity and non-specific signs and symptoms in the patient. This case report aimed to show a resemblance between the clinical symptoms of acute abdomen in diffuse peritonitis due to hollow viscus perforation and spontaneous ruptured endometrioma. A 42-year-old woman presented to our hospital with abdominal pain. She had a history of fever for two weeks. She came from a tropical rural area where typhoid fever is common. She was advised to undergo emergency laparotomy because of the suspicion of diffuse peritonitis due to a hollow viscus perforation due to typhoid infection. Because of acute abdominal pain, a vertical incision was made to explore her abdominal cavity, and chocolate-like fluid and ovarian cysts were found during surgery. The diagnosis was changed to diffuse peritonitis due to spontaneous rupture of the endometrioma bilaterally. This case suggests that the exact diagnosis and cause of abdominal pain varies. As the current gold standard for endometrioma is laparoscopy, surgeons must prepare a collaborative approach to the cause of the disease. Abdominal pain is common and often requires prompt medical care. In women, it can have various causes, including rare ones, such as spontaneous ruptured endometrioma, which can be difficult to diagnose owing to its rarity and vague symptoms. We describe the case of a 42-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever, initially suspected to have diffuse peritonitis due to typhoid infection. However, surgery revealed a ruptured endometrioma, highlighting the challenge of accurately diagnosing such conditions. This case emphasizes the need to consider the diverse diagnoses of abdominal pain and the importance of collaborative approaches among medical professionals to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Obesity is an emerging worldwide health care issue. It has a direct and indirect bearing on health-related outcomes. Rates of overweight and obesity have grown manifold in the past few decades globally. Once considered a problem of the affluent societies only, obesity is now dramatically on the rise in low- and middle-income countries also. Single anastomosis gastric bypass (SAGB) is one of the combined bariatric procedures adopted for weight loss in patients failing maximal medical therapy. Internal hernia (IH) after SAGB is a less recognized clinical entity. We hereby report our experience with four such cases under light of current available literature. Bariatric procedures are associated with some short- and long-term limitations. IHs are among one of the dreaded complications associated with some bariatric procedures with rates reaching up to 16% after classic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The incidence of IH post-SAGB is comparatively rare and is very less frequently reported. Symptoms of IH post-SAGB are quite nonspecific and depend on the time and extent of herniation. The symptoms can vary from benign intermittent colicky pain to severe intra-abdominal pain presenting as a surgical emergency. Routine physical examination and biochemical investigations are nonspecific and unreliable in evaluating those patients. Computed tomography (CT) with intravenous and oral contrast is the most common imaging modality used for preoperative evaluation of those symptoms. The CT findings can be unremarkable in patients having intermittent symptoms/herniation. Diagnostic laparoscopy is the cornerstone for diagnosis and management of patients having high suspicion of IH."

Limited studies have explored the relationship between serum hepcidin levels and AA. This study aimed to measure serum hepcidin levels in patients undergoing surgery with a preliminary diagnosis of AA and to assess whether these levels can serve as a biochemical marker for diagnosing AA. This study included patients aged 18 or older who presented to the emergency department between April 2018 and May 2019 and underwent surgery with a diagnosis of AA. The cohort comprised 94 patients with surgical pathology results compatible with AA (Group A), 16 patients with results not compatible with AA (Group B), and 42 healthy controls. Serum hepcidin levels were measured from venous blood samples. Mean hepcidin levels were 1750±285 pg/mL in Group A, 1349±381 pg/mL in Group B, and 1066±225 pg/mL in the control group. Statistically significant differences in serum hepcidin levels were observed between Group A and the control group (p<0.05). Hepcidin levels were significantly higher in patients with AA compared to both the control group and patients with surgically confirmed non-AA pathology. Therefore, hepcidin may serve as a useful adjunct in diagnosing acute appendicitis."

    "abstract": "The source of abdominal pain in patients with a history of gastric bypass can be difficult to determine. Synchronous disease processes may ultimately be the cause of their symptoms. Among the etiologies for hematemesis and obstruction in this population are the diagnoses of marginal ulcer and internal hernia. Given the potential complications of bariatric surgery, it is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis during the workup of these patients. A female with history of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) presented with abdominal pain and hematemesis. Intraoperative findings revealed intussusception of the jejunojejunostomy resulting in obstruction and ischemic bowel. Additionally, a perforated marginal ulcer of the Roux-limb was found to be present. This patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, bowel resection, jejunojejunostomy revision, and Graham patch repair. This case highlights a patient with history of RYGB presenting with obstruction and gastrointestinal bleeding. Although initially diagnosed with internal hernia and Mallory-Weiss hematemesis, surgical exploration revealed concurrent intussusception and marginal ulceration. While intussusception is a rare complication of bariatric surgery, it can occur secondary to mesenteric thinning and motility dysfunction from significant weight loss. It is imperative to maintain a broad differential diagnosis for the causes of obstruction and GI bleeding that include adhesive disease, abdominal wall hernia, internal hernia, intussusception, and marginal ulcers. Findings of obstruction or GI bleeding after bariatric surgery may represent a surgical emergency. While these symptoms may be attributed to a single diagnosis, clinicians must consider the presence of synchronous pathologies during the workup of patients."

    "abstract": "The number of solid organ transplantations performed annually is increasing and are increasing in the following order: Kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, small bowel, and uterine transplants. However, the outcomes of transplants are improving (organ survival > 90% after the 1st year). Therefore, there is a high probability that a general surgeon will be faced with the management of a transplant patient with acute abdomen. Surgical problems in immunocompromised patients may not only include graft-related problems but also nongraft-related problems. The perioperative regulation of immunosuppression, the treatment of accompanying problems of immunosuppression, the administration of cortisol and, above all, the realization of a rapidly deteriorating situation and the accurate evaluation and interpretation of clinical manifestations are particularly important in these patients. The perioperative assessment and preparation includes evaluation of the patient's cardiovascular system and determining if the patient has hypertension or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or if the patient has had any coagulation mechanism abnormalities or thromboembolic episodes. Immunosuppression in transplant patients is associated with the use of calcineurin inhibitors, corticosteroids, and antiproliferation agents. Many times, the clinical picture is atypical, resulting in delays in diagnosis and treatment and leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Multidetector computed tomography is of utmost importance for early diagnosis and management. Transplant recipients are prone to infections, especially specific infections caused by cytomegalovirus and Clostridium difficile, and they are predisposed to intraoperative or postoperative complications that require great care and vigilance. It is necessary to follow evidence-based therapeutic protocols. Thus, it is required that the clinician choose the correct therapeutic plan for the patient (conservative, emergency open surgery or minimally invasive surgery, including laparoscopic or even robotic surgery)."

Reports of ascariais causing complete bowel obstruction in adults are rare while having a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Here we present a case of a 35 years old female patient who presented with complete small bowel obstruction caused by >250 ascariasis worm. We report on a case of a 35-year-old female who presented with intermittent crampy abdominal pain of 2 days duration associated with frequent vomiting of ingested matter and failure to pass feces and flatus. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for acute complete small bowel obstruction and the intraoperative finding of a volvulated viable ileum with a visible and palpable ascariasis worms in the lumen of ileum. Enterotomy was done to extract >250 adult ascariasis worms. There are few reports of ascariasis causing complete small bowel obstruction in adults and there is no reported case of a massive number of adult worms from one patient. Though World Health Organization integrated approach, which includes sanitation, hygiene education and preventive chemotherapy brings a significant decrement on prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth, our case indicates that, clinicians should consider ascariasis as a differential diagnosis for SBO even in adult age groups."

    "abstract": "In the milieu of emergency medicine, pelvic and lower abdominal pain present recurrently, with ovarian torsion posing a formidable diagnostic quandary amid multifarious etiologies. Given the burgeoning reliance on CT in acute care settings, it invariably assumes primacy as the principal imaging modality. This study endeavors to elucidate the CT imaging manifestations encountered by surgically confirmed ovarian torsion patients and utilizing CT to differentiate necrosis. A retrospective analysis (January, 2015- April, 2019) utilizing hospital archives was conducted on patients diagnosed with ovarian torsion, post-surgery. Inclusion criteria encompassed patients who underwent CT examinations within one week of diagnosis. A large array of CT findings encompassing midline orientation, uterine deviation, intraovarian hematoma/mass, and multiple others were systematically documented. 90 patients were diagnosed with ovarian torsion- 53 (59%) had CT within one week of diagnosis, 41(77%) underwent a CT with IV contrast and 12 (23%) without IV contrast. Mean age was 43 years (range 19-77 years), with near equal distribution of involvement of each ovary. Mean maximum ovarian diameter was 11.7 ± 6.3 cm (4.2-34.8 cm). Most common imaging features include the presence of thickened pedicle (43/53, 81%), midline ovary (41/53, 77%), presence of thickened fallopian tube (31/49, 63%), and ipsilateral uterine deviation (33/53, 62%). Based on contemporaneous imaging report, torsion was diagnosed in 25/ 53 studies giving a sensitivity of 47%. Enlarged ovarian dimensions (> 3.0 cm), thickened vascular pedicle or fallopian tube, midline ovarian disposition with ipsilateral uterine deviation, and the presence of a whirlpool sign emerged as predominant CT imaging features in surgically confirmed ovarian torsion cases, serving as pivotal diagnostic aides for radiologists. Concomitant pelvic free fluid and intraovarian hematoma signify necrotic changes, indicative of ischemic severity and disease progression."

He underwent urgent investigations, including a CT angiogram aorta which did not reveal any abnormalities within the thorax, abdomen or pelvis and no cause of symptoms was identified. After being discharged, he re-presented 2 days later with syncopal episodes, abdominal pain and a significant drop in haemoglobin levels. This time, a CT mesenteric angiogram showed two hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms and a large haemoperitoneum. Following a hepatic artery embolisation, a workup showed that the likely cause of the pseudoaneurysms was a rare first presentation of polyarteritis nodosa. This case highlights the importance of considering the possibility of an aneurysmal rupture, especially when common causes of an acute abdomen have been excluded, and not relying on previous negative investigations to exclude pathology, as the outcomes can be detrimental."

During the two study periods, 855 appendectomies were performed, 427 in the pre-pandemic, and 428 during the pandemic. Demographic data were comparable between groups. There was statistically no significant difference in the type of appendectomy (p = 0.33) and the median hospital length of stay (3; (2-5) days, p = 0.08). There was an increase in the conversion rate during the pandemic period (4.2% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.03). The negative appendectomy rate and the incidence of perforated AA did not differ significantly (p = 0.34 for both). We did not observe a significant increase in the rate of AA complications during the COVID-19 pandemic at the UHC Zagreb. This may be attributed to two factors: (1) AA was diagnosed and treated as an emergency, which remained available during the pandemic, and (2) diagnostic and therapeutic protocols remained unaltered. We recommend a laparoscopic approach even during the COVID-19 pandemic."

Patients presenting with features of small bowel obstruction need urgent evaluation to avoid complications such as bowel gangrene, perforation, or peritonitis. Imaging is necessary in most cases of suspected bowel obstruction, to take an appropriate decision, for apt patient management. Among the common causes of small bowel obstruction, adhesions, external herniae, malignancies, and Crohn's disease top the chart. Imaging helps in determining the presence of obstruction, the severity of obstruction, transition point, cause of obstruction, and associated complications such as strangulation, bowel gangrene, and peritonitis. This review is based on the cases with unusual causes of bowel obstruction encountered during our routine practice and also on the extensive literature search through the standard textbooks and electronic databases. Through this review we want our readers to have sound knowledge of the imaging characteristics of the uncommon yet important causes of bowel obstruction. We have also revisited and structured a checklist to simplify the approach while reporting a suspected case of small bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction and in determining the cause and associated complications. Apart from the common causes of small bowel obstruction, we should also be aware of the uncommon causes of small bowel obstruction and their imaging characteristics to make an accurate diagnosis and for apt patient management."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in pregnant women. There has been a wide variance in clinical practice worldwide, with some favoring an antibiotic-only approach while others prefer surgery as the first-line management. Therefore, we designed the current analysis to synthesize the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of antibiotics versus surgery management. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, EuropePMC, and Cochrane Central from March 4, 1904 until November 25, 2022, to look for studies comparing antibiotics and surgery in pregnant patients with acute appendicitis. We only included studies that provided a comparison between the two treatments. We included preterm delivery, fetal loss, maternal death, and complications as outcomes. The results were compared using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies with a serious risk of bias. Results: We included five non-randomized studies for the analysis. We found that patients in the antibiotic group had a lower risk of preterm labor (OR 0.63 [95% CI 0.43-0.92]; p 0.02) but a higher risk of complications (OR 1.79 [95% CI 1.19-2.69]; p 0.005). We did not find any difference in the other outcomes. Conclusion: The increased risk of complications should caution clinicians about using antibiotics as the first-line management. More studies are required to identify patients who would benefit the most before antibiotics could be adopted as a treatment for acute appendicitis in pregnant patients."

In this study, the Abdominal Emergency Reporting and Data System (AEM-RADS) for urgent findings on abdominal CT scans is introduced to address the need for consistency in emergency radiology. In this prospective observational study, conducted over a six-month period, the urgency of abdominal CT scans was assessed using the proposed AEM-RADS scoring system. The committee developed a scale ranging from AEM-RADS 1 (normal) to AEM-RADS 5 (urgent disease). Interobserver agreement between two observers with different experience was evaluated, and robust AEM-RADS reference values were established by radiologists who were not observers. Statistical analysis used mean, standard deviations and Kendall's tau analysis for interobserver agreement. Among 2656 patients who underwent CT for abdominal emergencies, the AEM-RADS distribution was 17.50% AEM-RADS 1, 28.57% AEM-RADS 2, 7.22% AEM-RADS 3, 35.61% AEM-RADS 4, and 11.06% AEM-RADS 5. Interobserver agreement was high, especially for urgent and emergent cases (p < 0.0001). Notable discrepancies were observed in AEM-RADS categories 2C-D and 3B-C, emphasizing the influence of radiologists' experience on interpretation. However, the interobserver agreement for both AEM-RADS 2C-D and 3B-C were statistically significant (p < 0.001). AEM-RADS showed promising reliability, particularly in identifying urgent and emergent cases. Despite some inter-observer discrepancies, the system showed potential for standardized emergency workups. AEM-RADS could significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy in abdominal emergencies and provide a structured framework for shared decision-making between clinicians and radiologists.0."

This case report highlights a rare presentation of appendicitis in a 32-year-old male with no significant medical history, who presented with acute lower right abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Initial evaluation suggested appendicitis, further supported by laboratory findings and diagnostic imaging revealing a retrocecal appendix with surrounding inflammation. Remarkably, an FB, a fish bone, was discovered lodged within the perforated appendix, elucidating the unusual etiology. Emergency laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis and facilitated prompt surgical intervention.

The postoperative course was complicated by a wound infection, managed with antibiotics and secondary suturing. At one-year follow-up, the patient remained disease-free without the need for adjuvant therapy. The most common symptoms of jejunal GISTs include vague abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, obstruction or hemorrhage. Preoperative diagnosis and confirmation of GIST is difficult due to nonspecific symptoms and none of the radiographic procedures can establish the diagnosis with certainty. The surgical excision of the tumor along with infiltrated tissues is the treatment of choice for GIST. This case underscores the necessity of considering GISTs in differential diagnoses of acute abdomen and the critical role of prompt surgical management and multidisciplinary care in achieving favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain (AAP) is a common symptom presented in the emergency department (ED), and it is crucial to have objective and accurate triage. This study aims to develop a machine learning-based prediction model for AAP triage. The goal is to identify triage indicators for critically ill patients and ensure the prompt availability of diagnostic and treatment resources. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients admitted to the ED of Wuhan Puren Hospital with acute abdominal pain in 2019. To identify high-risk factors, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used with thirty-one predictor variables. Evaluation of eight machine learning triage prediction models was conducted using both test and validation cohorts to optimize the AAP triage prediction model. Eleven clinical indicators with statistical significance (p < 0.05) were identified, and they were found to be associated with the severity of acute abdominal pain. Among the eight machine learning models constructed from the training and test cohorts, the model based on the artificial neural network (ANN) demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9792 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9972. Further optimization results indicate that the AUC value of the ANN model could reach 0.9832 by incorporating only seven variables: history of diabetes, history of stroke, pulse, blood pressure, pale appearance, bowel sounds, and location of the pain. The ANN model is the most effective in predicting the triage of AAP. Furthermore, when only seven variables are considered, including history of diabetes, etc., the model still shows good predictive performance. This is helpful for the rapid clinical triage of AAP patients and the allocation of medical resources."

Hence, being aware of this phenomenon, particularly in scenarios involving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), is important. Existing literature emphasises immediate abdominal needle decompression as the initial management followed by close monitoring and keeping a low threshold for surgical intervention as a definitive measure. We decided to write up this case report to raise awareness that a tension pneumoperitoneum can result as a complication of CPR, a well-known and widely practiced algorithm."

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcers, though relatively rare, represent critical surgical emergencies with potentially life-threatening consequences. Their significance lies not only in their acute presentation but also in the diagnostic challenges they pose, particularly in patients with complex medical histories. Here we present a case of a 71-year-old female with a complex medical history, including insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, dementia, diverticulitis, and chronic back pain, who initially were unresponsive and cyanotic. Despite challenges in diagnosis due to her medical complexity and opioid use, she was ultimately diagnosed with a perforated duodenal ulcer. Tragically, despite immediate surgical intervention, she succumbed to her illness, highlighting the complexities involved in managing perforated peptic ulcers, especially in patients with multiple chronic medical conditions. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) can often remain asymptomatic, leading to delayed diagnosis and potentially life-threatening complications like perforation. Mortality rates associated with perforated peptic ulcers vary widely, ranging from 1.3% to 20%, with risk factors including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, and corticosteroid use. Diagnosis necessitates a high index of suspicion, thorough clinical examination, and imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) scans with oral contrast. Treatment strategies range from nonoperative management with intravenous (IV) histamine H2-receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to surgical intervention, depending on the patient's hemodynamic stability. However, the case presented underscores the challenges in timely diagnosis and intervention, particularly in patients with complex medical histories, where symptoms may be masked or attributed to other comorbidities. Recent studies indicate a demographic shift toward older age and a higher prevalence among females, emphasizing the importance of increased awareness and vigilance among healthcare providers. Early recognition of symptoms, prompt investigation, and interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial in optimizing outcomes for patients presenting with perforated peptic ulcers, especially in the context of their underlying medical conditions."

    "abstract": "Evidence shows that patients who visit the surgical and trauma emergency units may be discharged with untreated or increased pain levels. This study explored nurses' pain assessment and management approaches at a trauma-surgical emergency unit in Ghana. Seventeen nurses who work in the trauma department participated in this qualitative exploratory descriptive study. In-depth individual interviews were conducted, and the thematic analysis was utilized to identify emerging themes and subthemes. Three main themes were identified: patient pain indicators, pain management, and institutional factors influencing pain management. The study revealed that nurses rely on verbal expressions, non-verbal cues, physiological changes, and the severity of pain communicated. The findings highlighted staff shortage, inadequate resources, and lack of standardized guidelines as factors affecting pain and management. Although the study offers critical new perspectives on nurses' experiences regarding pain related issues at the trauma-surgical emergency units, its small sample size limited its generalizability."

TAC techniques aim to safeguard abdominal contents, drain intraperitoneal fluids, and minimize fascia and skin damage. Our goal is to outline clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes in oncological patients undergoing peritoneostomy. Patients undergoing TAC with vacuum therapy at a tertiary oncological center were studied, with data sourced from an institutional database. Forty-seven patients (54.3% female), with an average age of 63.1 ± 12.3 years, were included in the study. The primary tumor site was predominantly gastrointestinal (78.2%). Patients presented systemic signs of chronic disease, reflected by a mean body mass index of 18.2 ± 7.6 kg/m², hemoglobin level of 9.2 ± 1.8 g/dL, and albumin level of 2.3 ± 0.6 g/dL. Additionally, most patients had a low-performance status (53% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1/2, 44.8% Karnofsky score ≤80, and 61.2% Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥6). Emergency surgical complications were the main reasons for initial surgery (68%), with the majority attributed to fecal peritonitis (65.9%). Only 14.8% of patients achieved complete abdominal closure with an average of 24.8 days until closure. The in-hospital mortality rate was 85.2%. TAC is an alternative for oncological patients with surgical complications, but it carries a high mortality rate due to the compromised conditions of the patients."

    "abstract": "Fewer than 200 cases of Perforated Duodenal Diverticulum (\"PDD\") have been reported in the literature. The percentage of caused by trauma is generally very low and similar to rates recorded for duodenal injuries caused by trauma in the absence of diverticula (3 %-5 %). As a rare cause of abdominal pain after trauma, perforated duodenal diverticula are seldom diagnosed preoperatively. Despite preoperative CT scan demonstrating duodenal perforation, a diverticular origin is often only identified intraoperatively. A 36-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with severe upper abdominal pain that began after blunt trauma by a kick to his upper abdomen during a fight. A duodenal injury was identified by CT. Exploratory laparotomy then revealed a retroperitoneal perforation of a diverticulum located at the second segment of the duodenum. A review of the literature found few cases reporting perforated duodenal diverticulum secondary to trauma. Most cases identified the diverticulum at intraoperative exploration, with most approaches being through open surgery. Perforation of a duodenal diverticulum secondary to trauma is an extremely rare event, which is why it is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. As the presenting signs are often suggestive of duodenal perforation without a clear notion of duodenal diverticula at CT scan, a surgical approach and exploration is most frequently described. In our experience, the management of traumatic PDD aligns with the literature favoring the open surgical approach."

There have been no adequately powered randomized controlled trials in children. to determine the safety and efficacy of NOM for paediatric simple appendicitis. A non-inferiority randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing operative (OM) to NOM of SA in children aged five-15 years. Primary outcome was treatment success (no unplanned or unnecessary operation, or complication) at 30 days and 12 months, with a non-inferiority margin of 15%. (anzctr.org.au: ACTRN12616000788471).

Non-inferiority of NOM was not demonstrated at either time point, with 45.67% of NOM patients subsequently undergoing operation. There was no significant difference in complications. While noninferiority was not shown, NOM was safe, with no difference in adverse outcomes between the two groups. Further research to refine the place of NOM of simple appendicitis in children is required, including nuanced patient selection, longer term evaluation, the place of choice, and the acceptability of the treatment for children and their carers."

However, less than 1% of those who experience clip migration will present with pain, an abscess, or spontaneous extrusion. Here we present a rare case of sterilisation clip migration through the entire pelvic floor. A 66-year-old female was referred from community to the Surgical Emergency Unit with a possible metallic foreign body under the skin following an attempted routine gluteal cyst excision. The patient first noticed a lump under the skin 2 years ago which gradually became more apparent and tender over the previous 2 months. The patient denied recent trauma, had no co-morbidities and had a sterilisation procedure 24 years prior. Examination revealed a non-mobile solid structure just beneath the skin 5 cm laterally from the anal verge. Inflammatory markers were normal and an ultrasound confirmed a 15 × 7 mm foreign body in the subcutaneous tissues. The foreign body was excised easily under local anaesthesia, revealing a closed Filshie sterilisation clip. The wound was closed primarily, and recovery was uncomplicated. This was a case of sterilisation clip migration to the subcutaneous gluteal region. A literature review revealed 34 case reports of sterilisation clip migration, mostly to the bladder. Patients with a previous sterilisation procedure and suspected subcutaneous foreign body without trauma should elicit a high index of suspicion for migrated sterilisation clips. These clips can migrate through multiple layers of muscle and fascia, including the pelvic floor."

However, its appearance often indicates serious disease and poor prognosis. It is not difficult to distinguish typical portal venous gas from biliary tract gas on computed tomography because of their relatively different distribution within the liver. But the difference is not absolute. An 82-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department due to epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting for 1 day. Intrahepatic gas was found on computed tomography (CT), which was initially diagnosed as portal venous gas, and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was performed 3 hours after the first plain CT scan and revealed a significant reduction of intrahepatic gas, then diagnosed as biliary tract gas. Two days later, enhanced abdominal CT showed that biliary tract gas had disappeared. Continuous gastrointestinal decompression, anti-infection, rehydration and other treatments were given. After treatment, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and other symptoms of the patient were gradually relieved. The patient refused gastroenteroscopy and was discharged after 13 days of hospitalization. Portal venous gas and biliary tract gas may have similar CT findings and be misdiagnosed, and enhanced CT examination is necessary to confirm the diagnosis."

Acute SSEH is a rare phenomenon that presents with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms and most often is a surgical emergency. We present a previously healthy 34-year-old male with sudden onset progressive weakness and tingling in the right lower extremity that progressed to the left lower extremity while bench pressing weights, resulting in complete lower extremity paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 3.0 cm extradural mass centered in the dorsal and left lateral canal. After a T1-T4 hemilaminectomy was performed which was followed by inpatient rehabilitation, the patient had a favorable outcome improving from The American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A, complete impairment, to AIS grade C, incomplete impairment on discharge. Initially, the patient had complete motor and sensory paralysis below the level of T4, and upon discharge, the patient was able to attain modified independence in activities of daily living, mobility, and transfer. Due to the lack of risk factors for SSEH in this patient, the etiology is most likely related to the Valsalva maneuver while weightlifting. Lesions in the thoracic region with rapid progression of neurologic symptoms are indicators of poor prognosis, so this case highlights the importance of prompt recognition and intervention for improved outcomes to prevent devastating neurologic defects."

However, the pattern, outcome and factors of injury varies from setup to setup and is less studied in public health problems. To assess pattern of admission, outcome and its predictors among trauma patients visiting the surgical emergency department in a comprehensive specialized hospital. A retrospective follow-up study was conducted, and data were taken from the medical records of patients from 2019 to 2021. A simple random sampling technique was used to get a sample size of 386 from injured patient charts. Data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 software and exported to STATA version 14.1 for analysis. The dependent variable was injured patient's outcome, which could be died or not died. The independent variables with P value less than 0.25 in the bi-variable regression analysis were considered for the multivariable regression. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with the 95% CI were used to declare statistical significance. About 13.99% of injured patients with (95% CI: 10, 17) had died during the study period. The leading cause of injury was assault (62.44%) followed by road traffic accidents (26.17%). Severe Glasgow Coma Scale (AOR 6.6; 95% CI: 2.6-16.4), length of hospital stay more than or equal to 7 days (AOR=2.8; 95% CI: 1.2-6.2), time of arrival in between 1 and 24 h (AOR=0.15; 95% CI: 0.06-0.37), and upper trunk injury (AOR=6.3; 95% CI: 1.3-28.5) were significantly associated with mortality. Mortality after traumatic injury was considerably high. Severe Glasgow Coma Scale, Length of hospital stay more than or equal to 7 days, time of arrival in between 1 and 24 h, and upper trunk injury were the associated factors for mortality.

It is a medical and surgical emergency whose management is multidisciplinary. The lesions caused by the accidental ingestion of caustics can affect the functional and vital prognosis in 10% of cases. A retrospective, descriptive study from January 2020 to December 2022 (2 years), carried out in the emergency department of the General Reference Hospital of Niamey (Niger). The study included patients less than 15 years old admitted for ingesting a caustic product. Our study included 17 patients. The average age was 5 years, with age extremes of 2 to 11 years. We noted a male predominance with a sex ratio (M/F) of 2.4. Ingestion of caustic products was accidental in all cases. The caustic product was caustic soda in 59%. The average quantity of product ingested was 5 ml (2 ml to 20 ml). The average consultation time was 3 days (3 hours to 15 days). Clinically, dysphagia was the most functional sign, represented by 13 cases, or 76%. Regarding general signs, 3 patients (18%) were admitted with fever; blood pressure was normal in 15 patients (88%); and 2 patients (18%) were admitted in a state of shock. The respiratory rate was normal in 14 patients (82%). Four patients (24%) were admitted in a state of deterioration in the general condition associated with severe malnutrition and dehydration. On physical examination, 2 patients (12%) presented with abdominal defense at the epigastric level. Examination of the ENT sphere revealed benign buccopharyngeal ulcerations in 2 patients (12%). Esogastroduodenal fibroscopy was performed in 4 patients (24%). The caustic lesions observed in the esophagus were: Zargar stage I at 25%, stage Ila at 50%, and stage Illb at 25%. In the stomach, the lesions were Zargar stage I in 75% of cases and stage III in 25% of cases. An injected thoracic-abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) was performed in 3 patients (18%). It revealed a lack of enhancement of the esophageal wall compatible with esophageal necrosis in one patient. An esophagogastroduodenal transit was performed in 8 patients (47%) admitted more than 72 hours after ingestion of the caustic. They showed esophageal stenoses longer than 3 cm in 3 patients, multiple esophageal stenoses in 2 patients, a single esophageal stenosis in 2 patients, and a single antropyloric stenosis in 1 patient. Therapeutically, all patients benefited from antiemetics to avoid vomiting and proton pump inhibitors. Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis with third-generation cephalosporin was administered to 12 patients (71%). Corticosteroid therapy based on IV prednisolone at a dose of 1 g/1.73 m2 per day was used to limit or prevent stenoses in 9 patients (53%). Parenteral nutrition was administered to 7 patients (41%). Endoscopic dilations were performed in 2 patients (12%). Emergency surgical treatment was performed in 7 patients (41%): 3 patients underwent transitional feeding gastrostomies; in 3 others, esophagoplasties by colon transplant were performed, and 1 patient was treated by stripping of the esophagus associated with total gastrectomy. The postoperative course was marked by a leak of esocolic anastomosis in one patient for whom conservative treatment was performed with good progress. The average length of hospital stay was 5 days (1-32 days). Accidental caustic ingestions can have serious consequences. Preventing these accidents relies on raising public awareness of the dangers associated with improper storage of these products. L'ingestion de produits caustiques chez l'enfant constitue un problème de santé publique; il s'agit essentiellement d'accidents domestiques dus aux mauvais conditionnements et aux stockages de ces produits.

Notre étude avait inclus 17 patients; l’âge moyen était de 5 ans (2-11 ans); le sexratio (H/F) était de 2,4. La soude caustique était en cause dans 59 % des cas, et le délai moyen de consultation était de 3 jours. La dysphagie était présente dans 76 % des cas. L’état de choc et la dénutrition sévère étaient retrouvés dans respectivement 18 et 24 % des cas. À l'examen abdominal, 12 % des patients présentaient une défense abdominale. L'endoscopie était réalisée chez 4 patients et les lésions sévères œsophagiennes (IIIb de Zargar) étaient retrouvées dans 25 % des cas. Sur le plan thérapeutique, l'antibioprophylaxie et la corticothérapie avaient été réalisées dans respectivement 71 % et 53 % des cas. Les dilatations endoscopiques avaient été réalisées dans 12 % des cas et la chirurgie était indiquée chez 7 patients (41 %) dont 3 gastrostomies d'alimentation transitoires, 3 œsophagoplasties par transplant colique et 1 stripping de l’œsophage. Les ingestions accidentelles caustiques peuvent avoir des conséquences graves. La prévention de ces accidents repose sur la sensibilisation du public sur les dangers associés au stockage inapproprié de ces produits."

This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search in PubMed using the terms [timing] AND [lumbar disc herniation], supplemented by other relevant articles and guidelines. Symptoms resolve in 60% to 80% of patients with herniated discs in 6-12 weeks, and in 80% to 90% over the long term (≥ 1 year). According to the guidelines, 6-12 weeks of conservative treatment are recommended in the absence of significant neu - rologic deficits. Early surgery is indicated in case of worsening pain or new onset of neurologic deficits. Lumbar disc herniation associated bladder or bowel dysfunction (cauda equina syndrome) is considered an absolute surgical emergency that requires immediate decompression (within 24 to 48 hours). Patients with severe motor deficits (MRC ≤ 3/5) benefit from early intervention and should be offered surgery within three days, if possible, for the best chance of recovery. The degree of weakness and the duration of symptoms have been identified as risk factors for incomplete recovery. Early surgery can be considered in patients with mild paresis (MRC 4/5) in case of functional impairment (e.g., quadriceps paresis). Longer symptom duration and lower motor scores are associated with worse outcome and a lower chance of neurologic recovery. The recovery rate for motor deficits ranges from 33% to 75%, depending on the timing and modality of treatment as well as the motor score."

This study looked at waiting and treatment times, and their associated factors, in the surgical emergency service department at the Souro Sanou National Teaching Hospital (SSNTH) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. This study was carried out on 380 patients with a median age of thirty-eight. The sex ratio was 0.54. In 63.7 percent of cases, the participants lived in urban areas. Most of the patients surveyed were farmers (34.7 percent). The median waiting time for patients was eleven minutes. The nature of the trauma sustained was associated with the waiting time. The median time taken to administer first aid was sixty-three minutes, with the unavailability of medication at the hospital pharmacy cited as a factor contributing to this delay. The median time taken to obtain paraclinical results was 134 minutes and 102 minutes for laboratory tests and scans, respectively. The factor associated with delays in obtaining scan results was the need for surgical intervention. The median waiting time for surgery was 24.3 hours. The turnaround times in the SSNTH surgical emergency department are long. For the improvement of patient turnaround times to be possible, an overhaul of the department is in order. In particular, a rapid consultation team needs to be established, and essential drugs for emergency care need to be made readily available."

    "abstract": "Partial infarction of the great omentum is a rare cause of abdominal pain and may present as a surgical emergency. Omental infarction might occur due to its torsion, but cases without obvious cause are reported. Risk factors related to this condition are overweight, obesity, abdominal trauma, recent abdominal surgery, hypercoagulability, postprandial vascular congestion and an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Because of the condition's rarity, most patients are treated with surgery and the diagnosis is established intraoperatively. Preoperative diagnosis allows successful conservative treatment with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. This case reports a young female patient with class III obesity presented with spontaneous partial infarction of the great omentum treated with laparoscopy."

While this presentation can be non-specific, there are certain findings that warrant immediate surgical intervention. Portal venous gas on imaging in the setting of peritonitis and sepsis is one such finding. Thyrotoxicosis on the other hand is an uncommon diagnosis that is associated with non-specific symptoms resulting in delayed diagnosis, a clinical scenario that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Here, we present a rare case of a patient who presented with signs and symptoms of peritonitis and portal venous gas on CT scan that was taken emergently to the operating room. No intraabdominal pathology was identified. The patient was later diagnosed with thyrotoxicosis, the presumed cause of the acute abdomen presentation."

Despite advances in diagnostic modalities, the nonspecific presentation of abdominal TB poses challenges for timely diagnosis and management. Here, we report a case of abdominal TB in a critically state of a young man from Morocco, presenting with acute abdominal pain and signs of sepsis. Radiological investigations revealed features suggestive of intestinal perforation complicating peritoneal TB. Urgent laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis, yet the patient succumbed to advanced sepsis postoperatively. This case underscores the complexity of abdominal TB diagnosis and management, necessitating a high index of suspicion and multidisciplinary collaboration. With evolving surgical techniques and ongoing research efforts, optimizing strategies for early detection and treatment of abdominal TB remains imperative, particularly in endemic regions."

While rare, it represents a perilous aetiology of intestinal blockage, with clinical manifestations spanning from abdominal discomfort to mortality. We report the cases of three young adults (two males and one female) who presented to the emergency department with different manifestations of severe abdominal pain. All occurred within one month in a tertiary referral centre. Radiological evaluations confirmed the diagnosis of caecal volvulus in all. Subsequently, these individuals underwent right hemicolectomies with end-to-end anastomosis. All experienced an uncomplicated perioperative course. Caecal volvulus is uncommon, but its yearly incidence is increasing. Early detection and a heightened level of suspicion lead to a timely diagnosis, reducing morbidity and mortality rates. We report a case series of caecal volvulus, emphasizing its variable presentation and highlighting the critical importance of an early diagnosis. Typically, patients have a history of similar episodes that resolve without any medical intervention. Definitive treatment involves right hemicolectomy while conservative management is associated with very high recurrence rates. Early detection allows for prompt intervention, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality rates."

    "abstract": "Resuscitation of injured patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock with blood products in the prehospital environment is becoming more commonplace. However, blood product utilization is typically restricted and can be exhausted in the event of a prolonged entrapment. Delivery of large amounts of blood products to a scene is rare, particularly in rural settings. We present the case of a 26-year-old male who was entrapped in a motor vehicle for 144 min. First responders assessed the entrapped patient to be in hemorrhagic shock from lower extremities injuries. The Helicopter Emergency Medical Services team exhausted their supply of blood products shortly after arrival on scene. The local trauma center's Surgical Emergency Response Team (SERT) was requested to the scene. The preplanned response included seven units of blood components to provide massive transfusion at the point of injury and released directly to field responders by the blood bank. During extrication, the patient was given two units of packed red blood cells by initial responders with three more units of blood components from the SERT supply. During transfer to the hospital, the patient received an additional three units, and four units were transfused on initial trauma resuscitation in the hospital. He was found to have severe lower extremities injuries as the cause of his hemorrhage. The patient survived to hospital discharge. Delivery of large volumes of blood products to an entrapped patient with prolonged extrication time may be a lifesaving intervention. We advocate for integration of blood bank services and on scene physician guided resuscitation for prolonged extrications."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute compartment syndrome is a major surgical emergency with complex pathophysiology and a highly unpredictable pattern of evolution. We hypothesized that the onset of acute compartment syndrome of the leg or forearm is associated with variations in the surface temperature of the distal segment (foot or hand) with a distinct pattern, which acts as an early warning sign. Materials and Methods: We developed a monitoring device that consists of two thermic sensors attached to a modular limb splint, which continuously measure the temperature difference between the proximal and distal regions of the limb (i.e., arm-hand, thigh-foot). Firstly, we investigated both the arm-hand and thigh-foot temperature gradients of hospitalized patients' healthy limbs (43 patients, 56 upper limbs, 64 lower limbs) in order to establish a baseline. Secondly, we examined the correlation between the thermic gradients and intracompartmental pressure values in compartment syndrome limbs (20 patients, 6 upper limbs, 14 lower limbs). Results: For the control group, the mean values for the normal limb thermic gradients were -0.17 °C for the upper limbs. and 0.03 °C for the lower limbs. In the impending compartment syndrome group (defined by intracompartmental pressure values), the mean index was -0.38 °C. In the fully developed compartment syndrome group, the mean value was 4.11 °C. Discussions: Analysis was performed using the ANOVA one-way statistical method. This showed significant differences between the compartment syndrome group and the impending and control groups. A decreasing trend in the thermic gradient in patients with impending compartment syndrome compared with the control group was noted. Conclusions: The thermic gradient of limbs presenting signs of impending compartment syndrome decreases as a result of the increased temperature of the distal segment. This pattern can be used as an early diagnostic method for acute compartment syndrome. This technique is non-invasive and bears no risk to the patient, allowing facile continuous monitoring during immobilization."

    "title": "Identifying Preoperative Clinical Characteristics of Unexpected Gastrointestinal Perforation in Infants-A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Infants presenting with unexpected pneumoperitoneum upon abdominal X-ray, indicating a gastrointestinal perforation (GIP), have a surgical emergency with potential morbidity and mortality. Preoperative determination of the location of perforation is challenging but will aid the surgeon in optimizing the surgical strategy, as colon perforations are more challenging than small bowel perforations. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide an overview of preoperative patient characteristics, determine the differences between the small bowel and colon, and determine underlying causes in a cohort of infants with unexpected GIP. All infants (age ≤ 6 months) who presented at our center with unexpected pneumoperitoneum (no signs of pneumatosis before) undergoing surgery between 1996 and 2024 were retrospectively included. The differences between the location of perforation were analyzed using chi-squared and t-tests. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple tests. In total, 51 infants presented with unexpected pneumoperitoneum at our center, predominantly male (N = 36/51) and premature (N = 40/51). Among them, twenty-six had small bowel, twenty-two colon, and three stomach perforations. Prematurity (p = 0.001), birthweight < 1000 g (p = 0.001), respiratory support (p = 0.001), and lower median arterial pH levels (p = 0.001) were more present in patients with small bowel perforation compared with colon perforations. Pneumatosis intestinalis was more present in patients with colon perforation (p = 0.004). All patients with Hirschsprung disease and cystic fibrosis had colon perforation. The final diagnoses were mainly focal intestinal perforations (N = 27/51) and necrotizing enterocolitis (N = 9/51). Infants with unexpected GIP, birthweight < 1000 g, and prematurity have more risk for small bowel perforation. In case of colon perforation, additional screening (for Hirschsprung and cystic fibrosis) should be considered."

    "abstract": "Conducting urgent eye trauma surgery amidst the COVID-19 pandemic poses distinct difficulties, as strict infection control measures are crucial to safeguard both patients and medical staff. Nonetheless, eye trauma remains a significant contributor to avoidable vision loss in developing countries. A 57-year-old man presented with redness, bleeding, and injury in the left eye after a motorcycle accident 9 h prior to hospital admission, along with a torn wound on his left cheek. The visual acuity in the left eye showed no light perception. Limited eye movement in all directions, eyelid hematoma, conjunctival injection, hyphema, and tissue protrusion from the limbus at 6 to 8 o'clock positions were observed. The patient had a history of cataract surgery (+) in both eyes and was diagnosed with an open globe injury with zone II penetrating trauma, accompanied by full hyphema, vitreous and choroid prolapse in the left eye, and a confirmed case of COVID-19. Evisceration of the left eye was performed following the basic guidelines for ocular trauma surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Postoperative follow-up was conducted as usual by the operator in isolation for confirmed COVID-19 patients with no significant complaints. Urgent surgical intervention is necessary to prevent visual impairment, following guidelines recommending surgery within 4-72 h. Ocular tissue may facilitate COVID-19 transmission via the nasolacrimal system, posing risks to healthcare workers, particularly during surgery. Preoperative measures, including obtaining COVID-19 status and providing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), are crucial. Minimizing aerosol-generating procedures and employing virucidal disinfection further mitigates the transmission risks. This case underscores the need to balance immediate intervention for eye injuries with safety protocols for COVID-19, emphasizing standardized PPE and surgical procedures to safeguard healthcare professionals. Incorporating insights gained during the COVID-19 pandemic will fortify healthcare systems against future pandemics. In particular, it enables effective surgical emergency response while mitigating infectious disease risks."

However, there is no clear consensus on the appropriated timing of surgery for gastrointestinal perforation. We investigated association between wait time and surgical outcomes in emergency abdominal surgery. This single-center retrospective cohort study evaluated adult patients who underwent emergency surgery for gastrointestinal perforations between January 2003 and September 2021. Risk-adjusted restricted cubic splines modeled the probability of each mortality according to wait time. The inflection point when mortality began to increase was used to define early and late surgery. Outcomes among propensity-score matched early and late surgical patients were compared using percent absolute risk differences (RDs, with 95% CIs). Mortality rates began to rise after 16 h of waiting. However, early and late surgery groups showed no significant differences in 30-day mortality (11.4% vs. 5.7%), ICU stay duration (4.3 ± 7.5 vs. 4.3 ± 5.2 days), or total hospital stay (17.4 ± 17.0 vs. 24.7 ± 23.4 days). Notably, patients waiting over 16 h had a significantly higher ICU readmission rate (8.6% vs. 31.4%). The APACHE II score was a significant predictor of 30-day mortality. Although we were unable to reveal significant differences in mortality in the subgroup analysis, we were able to find an inflection point of 16 h through the RCS curve technique. Formal consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study, and ethical approval was obtained from the institutional research committee of our institution (B-2110-714-107) on 6 October 2021."

Prospective studies that evaluated health-related quality of life in acute or chronic pancreatitis were identified from systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science until 28th June 2023 (PROSPERO: CRD42021274743). Instrument characteristics were extracted, and methodological quality assessed using COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments) guidelines and GRADE approach. Narrative synthesis was conducted, with recommendations for use based on COSMIN criteria, evaluated according to World Health Organisation (WHO) quality of life domains. From 3850 records screened, 41 quality of life instruments were identified across 138 studies included. The majority (69.8%, n = 26) were designed to assess general health-related quality of life, whereas the remainder were abdominal-specific (n = 5) or pancreas-specific (n = 10). Only ten instruments (24.3%) demonstrated sufficient content validity, incorporating items in ≥5 WHO quality of life domains. However, only nine instruments (21.9%) incorporated public and patient involvement. Only the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index and PAN-PROMISE met the criteria to be recommended for use based on COSMIN methodological assessment. There is significant heterogeneity in instruments used to assess quality of life after pancreatitis, with almost all instruments considered insufficient.

Preoperative identification of cases of uncomplicated appendicitis that are amenable to a laparoscopic approach may facilitate the implementation of laparoscopic appendicectomy programs in training hospitals. With limited access to preoperative imaging, alternative strategies for this preoperative prediction are needed. A retrospective audit of patients over the age of 12 years with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of acute appendicitis over a 5-year period was performed. Patients were categorized as uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis and C-reactive protein (CRP) and white cell count (WCC) reviewed. Receiver operating characteristics curves were constructed for these blood tests and acute appendicitis severity. Youden's J statistic was used to determine optimal cut off values for diagnosing complicated appendicitis. 358 patients had confirmed appendicitis and complete blood results. Of these, 189 (52.79%) had complicated appendicitis with a 40.22% perforation rate. Median CRP in uncomplicated and complicated groups were 68 mg/L (IQR 19-142) and 216 mg/L (IQR 103-313) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.80). The median WCC in the two groups were 12.6 × 109 cells/L (IQR 9.9-15.6) and 14.4 × 109 cells/L (IQR 11.5-18.28) with an AUC of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.56-0.67). The optimal cut off value for CRP was found to be 110 mg/L with a sensitivity of 74.74% and specificity of 69.23%. A cutoff value of 110 mg/dl CRP can distinguish patients with early appendicitis from those with complicated disease and when used in conjunction with clinical assessment may help identify patients in whom laparoscopic appendicectomy is appropriate."

Corresponding to the delivery and surgery times, 200 women who had no diagnosis of pregnancy-associated adnexal mass served as controls. The women in the control group and study groups had statistically similar gestational age at delivery, birth weight and preterm delivery (p > 0.05 for all). Miscarriage was significantly more frequent in women undergoing surgery for adnexal mass during pregnancy (p = 0.001). The women who had surgery for adnexal mass during pregnancy, at the time of cesarean section and following delivery were statistically similar with respect to surgery type and histopathological diagnosis (p > 0.05 for both). Malignancy was detected in none of the patients who underwent surgery for adnexal mass during pregnancy. Acute abdomen was the indication for the emergency surgery in six patients (3.5%) who had surgery for adnexal mass during pregnancy.

All studies originated from middle-income countries and the majority (76%) had sample sizes smaller than 100 patients. All studies were appraised as providing less than adequate evidence. Included studies identified long delays to treatment and highlighted ongoing debates on the value of scoring systems and Doppler ultrasonography in diagnosing torsion. Major heterogeneity in surgical approaches to treatment of testicular torsion in children was also observed. Literature on paediatric testicular torsion in LMICs is scarce and heterogeneous. Prospective, multi-centre research on the management of this common paediatric surgical emergency is urgently required."

    "title": "Impact of Education and Experience on Radiographers' Ability to Diagnose Acute Appendicitis: A Survey in Private Malaysian Hospitals.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a global surgical emergency. Radiographic modalities usually identify acute appendicitis, although radiographers' competence is questionable. This study examines how clinical radiographers' education and experience affect their ability to identify acute appendicitis using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (USG) characteristics. The study also aimed to determine which variable strongly influences their knowledge level. The study surveyed radiographers with a four-part self-administered questionnaire containing demographic information and eight knowledge-based questions about the appearance of acute appendicitis in MRI, CT and USG, separately. Before distribution, the questionnaire was validated and checked the reliability. Clinical radiographers' knowledge about using MRI to diagnose acute appendicitis was strongly affected by education and experience (η2 = 0.13 and 0.14; P < 0.05), with bachelor's degree holders scoring higher regardless of experience. Radiographers with more than 5 years of experience knew more about CT and USG features to identify acute appendicitis (η2 = 0.40 and 0.27; P < 0.05). Radiographers with a bachelor's degree and greater experience had higher overall knowledge of MRI, CT and USG to diagnose acute appendicitis (η2 = 0.51 and 0.11; P < 0.05). With adjusted R2 = 54% (F [2, 44] = 27.94; P < 0.001), education and experience highly predicted the overall knowledge level. The study found gaps in radiographers' knowledge of the radiographic appearance of acute appendicitis. Clinical radiographers' education level and years of experience substantially affect their knowledge level. In addition, experience is a good predictor than education level for overall knowledge level. Therefore, the study emphasises the importance of continuing education and training for radiographers to diagnose acute appendicitis quickly and accurately."

    "title": "Efficacy of modified Alvarado score combined with ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a prospective analytical study.",
    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency encountered in the emergency department, and diagnosis is difficult at times. Imaging and various clinical scoring are present to aid in the diagnosis. Ultrasound is an easily accessible modality and can accomplish more than a computed tomography (CT) scan at times. Modified Alvarado score (MAS) includes parameters that do not pose an extra financial burden to the patient. Combining both the imaging and clinical scoring systems, the authors decided to evaluate the combined MAS for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. This is a prospective analytical study conducted in a tertiary hospital for one and a half years. Fifty-five patients with right lower quadrant pain were enroled, and evaluated along with an ultrasound. MAS and combined MAS were obtained, and the results of the histopathological examination were compared. Out of 55 clinically diagnosed cases who underwent an emergency appendectomy, 27 were males and 28 were females. Of these, 50 cases had acute appendicitis as per histopathological examination. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the MAS was 42%, 100%, 100%, 20.8%, 47.27%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of the USG were 84%, 40%, 93.3%, 20%, and 80%, respectively. Combining both the scores, the Combined MAS had the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 98.18%, 0%, 90.7%, 0%, and 89.09%, respectively. As the combination of USG has raised the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of the MAS, it can be an alternative to CT/MRI imaging for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in resource-limited settings. This score requires further studies to validate with a larger sample size."

Stercoral ulceration is thought to occur due to ischemic pressure necrosis of the bowel wall, which is caused by the presence of a stercoraceous mass. To underscore this urgent surgical situation concerning clinical presentation, surgical treatment, and results, we present the case of a 66-year-old man with a stercoral perforation. A 66-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout presented at the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and a low-grade fever lasting for a few hours. Abdominal computed tomography indicated a suspected bezoar (approximately 7.6 cm) in the dilated cecum, accompanied by pericolic fat stranding, mild proximal dilatation of the ileum, pneumoperitoneum, and minimal ascites. Intraoperatively, feculent peritonitis with isolated cecal perforation were observed. Consequently, a right hemicolectomy with peritoneal lavage was performed. A histopathological examination supported the intraoperative findings. In stercoral perforations, a diagnosis should be diligently pursued, especially in older adults, and prompt surgical intervention should be implemented."

    "abstract": "Despite being the most common abdominal surgical emergency, the cause of acute appendicitis (AA) remains unclear, since in recent decades little progress has been made regarding its etiology. Obstruction of the appendicular lumen has been traditionally presented as the initial event of AA; however, this is often the exception rather than the rule, as experimental data suggest that obstruction is not an important causal factor in AA, despite possibly occurring as a consequence of the inflammatory process. Type I hypersensitivity reaction has been extensively studied, involving Th2 lymphocytes, and cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13, which have well-defined functions, such as a positive-feedback effect on Th0 for differentiating into Th2 cells, recruitment of eosinophils and the release of eosinophilic proteins and the production of IgE with the activation of mast cells, with the release of proteins from their granules. Cytotoxic activity and tissue damage will be responsible for the clinical manifestation of the allergy. AA histological features are similar to those found in allergic reactions like asthma. The intestine has all the components for an allergic immune response. It has contact with hundreds of antigens daily, most of them harmless, but some can potentially induce an allergic response. In recent years, researchers have been trying to assess if allergy is a component of AA, with their latest advances in the understanding of AA as a Th2 reaction shown by the authors of this article."

It presents a challenge for surgeons due to its high disability rate and difficult management. Early fasciotomy decompression is crucial in preventing severe complications. Classic fasciotomy approaches for tibial osteofascial compartment syndrome include double-incision and single-incision techniques.This paper presents a case of a 24-year-old female with bilateral tibial posterior compartment syndrome resulting from prolonged squatting after alcohol intoxication, which is a relatively rare mechanism. We employed an innovative posterior approach to manage the patient with tibial posterior compartment syndrome. Ultimately, we successfully preserved the patient's legs and achieved a good functional recovery.The paper reported a rare case with bilateral posterior tibial compartment syndrome resulting from squatting for 10 hours after alcohol intoxication. The patient achieved favorable outcomes in lower limb function following treatment with a new fasciotomy approach, the posterior approach.The new approach for treating posterior tibial compartment syndrome can serve as a valuable reference for surgeons."

    "abstract": "Obturator hernia accounts for less than 1 % of all documented cases of pelvic hernias. It most commonly presents as an obstructive syndrome in elderly, multiparous, slim women, characterized by a wider pelvis that facilitates the passage of the hernia sac through the obturator foramen alongside the obturator nerve. In this case, adhering to the SCARE (Updating Consensus Surgical CAse REport) checklist criteria, we present a typical scenario involving an elderly woman who was initially misdiagnosed with a fecaloma, concealing an obturator hernia. An 85-year-old patient, displaying prodromal signs of senile disease, presented for medical attention with incapacitating abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Rectal examination revealed the presence of a fecaloma, and glycerin administration was performed rectally. The patient's condition worsened with the development of mental confusion and hyperactive delirium. Abdominal Computer tomography scan (CT scan) revealed right obturator hernia with enteral segment insinuation and dilation of the proximal bowel. An infraumbilical laparotomy was performed. The herniation of an ileal segment and the right ovary through the obturator foramen was identified. The content proved irreducible to manual maneuvers, leading to obturator muscle section following the dissection of the Retzius space. The right round ligament of the uterus was sectioned, and we manage to preserve the Obturatory branch of the lumbar plexus throughout dissection. A polypropylene mesh was positioned and secured with non-absorbable sutures on the Cooper's ligament, iliac crest, and obturator muscle and segmental enterectomy with primary anastomosis using a linear stapler was performed. This demanding case brings to the spotlight the importance of reevaluating even the usual cases. We provide our experience bringing together an unusual diagnosis after the conduction of a once diagnosed fecaloma that almost went down to a perforated acute abdomen. Hence the importance of suspect obturator hernia in unknown obstructive abdomen in elderly women. With this report we aim to raise awareness of careful propaedeutic inquiry of acute abdomen. We provide our experience bringing together the diagnosis that agrees with our literature review. Elderly patients commonly challenge the clinical evaluation, especially those with signs of senile disease. Thereby, inkling hidden diagnosis in typical scenarios can improve the patient's care in emergency settings."

Ruptures occur spontaneously or after trauma. We aimed to report data from patients who underwent emergency surgery due to spontaneous intra-abdominal hydatid cyst rupture. Upon a retrospective review of the records at Department of General Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Harran University, Şanlıurfa, Turkey, we found that 34 cases were operated on due to hydatid cyst rupture between January 2012 and October 2022. All patients were operated on in an emergency, and partial cystectomy, intra-abdominal irrigation, and drainage were performed using laparotomy. The patients were evaluated in terms of age, sex, symptoms, radiological findings, laboratory results, intraoperative findings, and postoperative follow-ups. Twenty-two (64.7%) female and 12 (35.3%) male patients were enrolled. The mean age was 39.1 (±17.58) years. All patients experienced spontaneous rupture. The ruptured cyst was found in the liver in 32 patients (94%), the spleen in 1 patient (3%), and the pelvis in 1 patient (3%). The diagnosis was determined using ultrasonography in 12 (35.3%) patients, computed tomography in 21 (61.8%) patients, and magnetic resonance imaging in 1 (2.9%) patient. All patients exhibited acute abdomen and leukocytosis. The average length of hospital stay was 5.14 (±1.37) days. Hydatid cyst rupture should be considered in cases of acute abdomen, particularly in regions where the disease is endemic, as in our region. The ruptured hydatid cyst was primarily observed in the liver (94.11% of cases)."

The patient underwent subcutaneous abscess, bladder repair, and cystostomy. One month after surgery, the patient had normal micturition. Acute abdominal pain is one sign of emergency surgery. It can be caused by infection, inflammation, vascular occlusion, or obstruction. Physical and laboratory examination of the patient showed a sepsis condition. CT Cystography showed the presence of bladder rupture and subcutaneous abscess. The only management is surgical exploration for infection source control. This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and comprehensive management, involving surgical intervention and targeted antibiotics, for sepsis-related complications post-TURP and bladder repair, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach for optimal outcomes and complication prevention."

Our pre-op workup was inconclusive; therefore, we planned to go for a diagnostic laparoscopy, where surprisingly, the appendix was long, inflamed, and attached to the posterior wall of the cecum. Thus, a ring-like structure was developed, in which 8 to 10 cm of the terminal ileum (the last part of the small bowel) was going through and causing an internal hernia. Although blood and radiology workups provide valuable assistance in diagnosing common cases, a highly suspicious sense and skillful surgeons with good clinical experience play a major role in managing such rare presentations."

The ESS ranging from 0 to 29 is an extensive risk calculator based on 22 variables including important parameters like demographics, preoperative treatment, comorbidities, and laboratory values. Twenty patients who underwent emergency laparotomy were preoperatively assessed and ESS was calculated for each. After establishment of diagnosis and resuscitation, the patient was taken up for emergency laparotomy. Postoperatively, patients were monitored clinically as well as with laboratory and radiological investigations as per case needed till discharge and further followed up physically in OPD/ward or interviewed telephonically for 30 days on a weekly basis. Incidence of mortality and morbidity in terms of postoperative complications, ICU admission, reoperation and readmission among the cases occurring within 30 days of procedure were recorded. ESS correlated well with the outcome in the current study, 10 out of 14 patients with score less than 8 were discharged without any complications. Mean ESS was higher among non-survivors. Ability of ESS to predict postoperative mortality, morbidity and ICU stay was proven statistically with c-statistics of 0.853, 0.84, 0.879 respectively. ESS was found to be a good predictor for the development of postoperative lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (c-statistic=0.828), sepsis (c-statistic=0.867), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (c-statistic=0.805), acute kidney injury (AKI) (c-statistic=0.804). ESS showed poor correlation with reoperation and readmission rates. The current study underscores the critical importance of employing risk stratification through ESS for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. By employing ESS, healthcare professionals can accurately anticipate resuscitation requirements and stabilize patients preoperatively. This proactive approach enables the identification and optimization of patients unsuitable for immediate surgery, facilitating informed decisions on targeted treatment, surgical intervention, and postoperative care pathways."

A 54-year-old female was referred to the surgical unit with a history of severe upper abdominal pain and repeated vomiting. No other symptoms were reported and there was no significant medical or family history except the history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Examination revealed that the patient had a medical condition. was vitally stable with tenderness in the upper abdomen, in particular the epigastric and right hypochondrial, but no signs of generalized peritonitis. Her white cell count was elevated at 24,000x10^3/UL, and a C-reactive protein of 45.5 mg/dL. An upright CXR revealed the classic gas under the diaphragm. Abdominal CT with oral gastrograffin identified the diagnosis of perforated duodenal ulcer without ulcer leak. The case was treated by conservative management started with resuscitation, nil per os, IV fluid, IV antibiotics, and close observation and the patient was stable with no complications and completed the nonoperative management successfully till discharge after 10 days of hospital stay. The case illustrates that although this condition is uncommon to be treated without surgical intervention, there are some factors and criteria for successful NOM. Peptic ulcer perforation is a life-threatening surgical emergency. Surgery is the standard treatment for PPU and NOM can be conducted safely and successfully in highly selected cases. the surgeon should keep a wide safety window while providing nonstandard management with readiness to operate at any time. We believe that the main factor in successful nonsurgical management of our case is being fasted for a long time before perforation."

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding potentially fatal events. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe successful cases of surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma, aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed. Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was found and removed from the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS With an increased risk of perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important."

The NGO EMERGENCY's hospital in Goderich, Freetown, Sierra Leone. The hospital is a referral center for acute care surgery. Critical patients admitted to the hospital's ICU. Following brief, practical training of the nursing staff, one basic mechanical ventilator was installed at the hospital's ICU, under the supervision of two intensivists. Only patients with a body weight of over 15 kg and who met the \"extreme criteria\" for MV received this life-saving therapy. Of the 195 files of patients admitted to ICU during the study period, 162 were analyzed. The median age was 16 (interquartile range 7-27) and 48.1% of the population were under 14 years. The most common cause of admission was trauma (58.6%), followed by acute abdomen (33.3%), caustic soda ingestion (6.2%), and burns (1.9%). Of the overall population, 26 patients (16%) underwent MV (88.5% trauma cases vs. 11.5% acute abdomen). Median time on MV was 24 hours (12-64). The mortality rate in the MV group was 30.8% (8/26), while in the overall study population, it was 11.7% (19/162). One potentially life-threatening event of tube obstruction was handled appropriately. This study strongly supports the implementation of MV in low-resource settings. In our experience, the consistent benefit of reduced mortality among critical patients largely outweighs the associated challenges."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) represents the most frequent surgical emergency. Perforation was long considered the ultimate outcome of AA, prompting appendectomy; which remains the standard treatment. New data have clarified the role of the appendix, justifying conservative treatment. This narrative review aims to summarize the evidence regarding the non-operative treatment (NOT) of AA in adults. The literature search was performed via the PubMed Medline database. Our criteria-based selection resulted in a total of 48 articles for review. Recent trials and meta-analyses have assessed NOT, which support primary antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated AA. Although it has a significant recurrence and failure rate, NOT does not appear to increase the risk of appendicular perforation. Moreover, NOT compared with appendectomy, seems to be associated with less morbidity, lower cost of care and preserved quality of life. First-line NOT seems to be a reasonable approach for the treatment of uncomplicated CT-confirmed AA. Careful patient screening would definitely enhance the success rate."

Postoperatively, the patient developed complications, including pneumonia and multi-organ failure, leading to death 10 days after surgery. Histopathological analysis confirmed the metastatic nature of the lesion. This case underscores the unpredictable nature of RCC metastasis and highlights the need for vigilance in post-nephrectomy patients. The rarity of small bowel involvement by RCC metastasis, particularly presenting as perforation, makes this case a significant contribution to medical literature, emphasizing the challenges in the diagnosis and management of such atypical presentations."

A four-month-old infant presented with a one-day history of non-projectile vomiting, three episodes, food contents, worsened by feeding, accompanied by intermittent low-grade fever, and one instance of passing black tarry stool. After outpatient treatment, the infant showed improvement for three days, but later the mother noticed a protruding, self-reducing anal mass, hence the suspected rectal prolapse, which was then Referred for further management. Intussusception, the most frequent surgical emergency in infants and young children aged 3 to 6 months, is primarily idiopathic, with the ileocecal region being the most commonly affected (90 % of cases). However, when the intussusceptum advances to the anus, it's rare, often leading to misdiagnosis and mismanagement. Intussusception of the colon should be added to the differential diagnosis of symptoms and the clinical picture of rectal prolapse."

    "abstract": "Colorectal carcinoma is common, particularly on the left side. In 20% of patients, obstruction and ileus may be the first clinical manifestations of a carcinoma that has advanced (stage II, III or even IV). Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, plain abdominal radiogram, computed tomography (CT), CT colonography and positron emission tomography/CT. The best management strategy in terms of short-term operative or interventional and long-term oncological outcomes remains unknown. For the most common left-sided obstruction, the first choice should be either emergency surgery or endoscopic decompression by self-expendable metal stents or tubes. The operative plan should be either one-stage or two-stage resection. One-stage resection with on-table bowel decompression and irrigation can be accompanied or not accompanied by proximal defunctioning stoma (colostomy or ileostomy). Primary anastomosis is more convenient but has increased risks of anastomotic leakage and morbidity. Two-stage resection (Hartmann's procedure) is safer and the most widely used despite temporally affecting quality of life. Damage control surgery in high-risk frail patients is less frequently performed since it can be successfully substituted with endoscopic stenting or tubing. For the less common right-sided obstruction, one-stage surgical resection is more beneficial than endoscopic decompression. The role of minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic or robotic) is a subject of debate. Emergency laparoscopic-assisted management is advantageous to some extent but requires much expertise due to inherent difficulties in dissecting the distended colon and the risk of rupture and subsequent septic complications. The decompressing stent as a bridge to elective surgery more substantially decreases the risks of morbidity and mortality than emergency surgery for decompression and has equivalent medium-term overall survival and disease-free survival rates. Its combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation may have a positive effect on long-term oncological outcomes. Management plans are crucial and must be individualized to better fit each case."

    "abstract": "Large bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency worldwide. Large bowel obstruction secondary to descending colonic volvulus is an extremely rare condition with only few reported cases worldwide. Its extreme rarity is due to its retroperitoneal location and lack of mesentery. A 75-year-old male patient with a history of sigmoidectomy and end-to-end descending colorectal anastomosis 19 years previously, presented with failure to pass faeces and flatus of 1 day duration with associated colicky abdominal pain, distension and vomiting. The abdomen was distended but soft and non-tender. Digital rectal examination showed an empty and ballooned rectum. The intraoperative finding was of a 360° counter-clockwise rotated descending colon. Detorsion and extraperitonealization of the descending colon was performed and the patient was successfully discharged. Volvulus is a twisting of a segment of bowel along its own mesentery. Sigmoid volvulus and caecal volvulus accounts for up to 90% and less than 20% of cases, respectively. Descending colonic volvulus is described in very few case reports. Diagnosis is clinical and confirmed by imaging. Descending colonic volvulus is a surgical emergency and an extremely rare cause of large bowel obstruction. Surgical management options include extraperitonealization of the descending colon, diversion colostomy or resection and primary end-to-end anastomosis."

Its low incidence makes EPA less well-known among the public and some medical professionals, and it is frequently under-diagnosed. We aimed to explore the incidence, clinical presentation, modalities of imaging to diagnose and options for treating EPA. An observational retrospective analysis was conducted between 2016 and 2022 at a tertiary hospital in an Arab Middle Eastern country. There were 156 EPA cases diagnosed over six years, with a mean age of 33 years. Males represented 82% of the cohort. The entire cohort was treated non-operatively except for eight patients who had surgical intervention using open or laparoscopic surgery. The diagnosis was made by a computerized tomographic scan (CT). However, plain X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed initially in a few selected cases to rule out other conditions. No specific blood test indicated EPA; however, a histopathology examination was diagnostic. No mortality was reported in the study cohort. This is the most extensive study analyzing EPA patients from the Middle East.

    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis is a common cause of acute abdomen and the most frequent surgical emergency in the world. Since the nineteenth century, surgical resolution has been the most accepted treatment worldwide, and laparoscopic appendectomy is currently preferred as the treatment of choice because it has several benefits. The closure of the appendiceal stump is the most crucial step during appendectomy since its inadequate management can cause post-surgical complications. Throughout recent years, several methods have been proposed to perform this closure. This study was performed to compare the post-surgical outcomes of the use of endoloop and endostapler devices. Methods This is a retrospective study of 290 patients aged 18 to 83 who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy between 2016 and 2020. Demographic data, clinical history, tomographic findings, and laboratory data were collected, as well as appendicular base management technique, severity degree of appendicitis at hospital admission, postoperative complications at 30 days, hospital readmission, and in-hospital stay. Statistical tests and binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors, with a significance level of p<0.05. Results Demographic data and clinical history did not show statistically significant differences. The presence of a pre-surgical abscess with tomography was 1.58 times higher in the endostapler group. Post-surgical results showed that the use of endostapler devices represented a 2.7 times higher risk of post-surgical abscess. The endostapler group was also found to have 1.87 times the risk of post-surgical sepsis. Conclusion Our study shows that the use of an endoloop reduces the risk of postoperative abscess by 16.5% and protects against the development of post-surgical sepsis by 30%."

This report presents a rare case of jejunal diverticulosis complicated with chronic interstitial and mesenteric adhesions, chronic mesenteric volvulus, and decompensated small-bowel obstruction. An 84-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with a 24-h history of acute colicky abdominal pain. He denied other signs or symptoms. The preoperative diagnosis based on physical and radiologic evaluations was challenging, and only diagnostic laparoscopy revealed extensive small-bowel diverticulosis. Midline laparotomy was performed as definitive surgery, revealing diverticulosis in the proximal 2-m section of the jejunum, starting approximately 20 cm from Treitz's ligament; the affected section was resected. The postoperative recovery was excellent. The histopathologic report confirmed substantial jejunal diverticulosis with chronic fibrosis, adhesions, and strictures. Histopathologic evaluation is necessary because tumors can be misdiagnosed as diverticula. This case report should serve as a reminder for surgeons to be cognizant of the signs of uncommon conditions, such as jejunal diverticulosis. Albeit rare, jejunal diverticulosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen."

This Review addresses key issues associated with the construction and maintenance of hemodialysis arteriovenous access. All patients with kidney failure should have an individualized strategy (known as Patient Life-Plan, Access Needs, or PLAN) for kidney replacement therapy and dialysis access, including contingency plans for access failure. Patients should be referred for hemodialysis access when their estimated glomerular filtration rate progressively decreases to 15 to 20 mL/min, or when their peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplant, or current vascular access is failing. Patients with chronic kidney disease should limit or avoid vascular procedures that may complicate future arteriovenous access, such as antecubital venipuncture or peripheral insertion of central catheters. Autogenous arteriovenous fistulas require 3 to 6 months to mature, whereas standard arteriovenous grafts can be used 2 to 4 weeks after being established, and \"early-cannulation\" grafts can be used within 24 to 72 hours of creation. The prime pathologic lesion of flow-related complications of arteriovenous access is intimal hyperplasia within the arteriovenous access that can lead to stenosis, maturation failure (33%-62% at 6 months), or poor patency (60%-63% at 2 years) and suboptimal dialysis. Nonflow complications such as access-related hand ischemia (\"steal syndrome\"; 1%-8% of patients) and arteriovenous access infection require timely identification and treatment. An arteriovenous access at high risk of hemorrhaging is a surgical emergency. The selection, creation, and maintenance of arteriovenous access for hemodialysis vascular access is critical for patients with kidney failure. Generalist clinicians play an important role in protecting current and future arteriovenous access; identifying arteriovenous access complications such as infection, steal syndrome, and high-output cardiac failure; and making timely referrals to facilitate arteriovenous access creation and treatment of arteriovenous access complications."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency. Our report describes a case of a 61-year-old male who was found to have a PROLENE suture left in situ from a previous open appendectomy 22 years ago, over which a fibrous adhesive band had formed, resulting in a terminal ileal volvulus and subsequent SBO. A 61-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of severe lower abdominal cramps, nausea and constipation. A previous open appendectomy, performed 22 years ago, was the only significant detail in his medical history. A CT can with oral contrast was performed which showed dilatation of the terminal ileum and a complete absence of opacification of the cecum. Laparoscopy was then performed and a large adhesive band which formed over a suture from his previous open appendectomy was observed. On dissection of the adhesion, the bowel decompressed and returned to normal. Patient was discharged with no complications. This is quite a unique case due to the structure of the adhesive band that was formed and the resulting terminal ileal volvulus which is an uncommon occurrence. We could not find any similar reports in our search of the literature and believe our report is novel in this regard. We explored a novel etiology of adhesion formation over a foreign body left in situ and this should be considered by surgeons, especially when the clinical picture is uncommon such as a terminal ileal volvulus in this case."

    "abstract": "An increasing number of older patients require emergency abdominal surgery for acute abdomen. They are susceptible to surgical stress and lose their independence in performing daily activities. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with faster recovery, less postoperative pain, and shorter hospital stay. However, few studies have examined the relationship between laparoscopic surgery and physical functional decline. Thus, we aimed to examine the relationship between changes in physical function and the surgical procedure. In this was a single-center, retrospective cohort study, we enrolled patients who were aged ≥ 65 years and underwent emergency abdominal surgery for acute abdomen between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. We assessed their activities of daily living using the Barthel Index. Functional decline was defined as a decrease of ≥ 20 points in Barthel Index at 28 days postoperatively, compared with the preoperative value. We evaluated an association between functional decline and surgical procedures among older patients, using multiple logistic regression analysis. During the study period, 852 patients underwent emergency abdominal surgery. Among these, 280 patients were eligible for the analysis. Among them, 94 underwent laparoscopic surgery, while 186 underwent open surgery. Patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery showed a less functional decline at 28 days postoperatively (6 vs. 49, p < 0.001). After adjustments for other covariates, laparoscopic surgery was an independent preventive factor for postoperative functional decline (OR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.83; p < 0.05). In emergency abdominal surgery, laparoscopic surgery reduces postoperative physical functional decline in older patients. Widespread use of laparoscopic surgery can potentially preserve patient quality of life and may be important for the better development of emergency abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "Cecal volvulus is a rare intestinal pathology that occurs due to abnormal cecum mobility associated with spectrum of complications. It is usually manifested in adults. However, on extremely rare occasions, it occurs in pediatrics. We presented a case of cecal volvulus demonstrating the significance of early diagnosis and treatment to reach successful outcomes. A 12 year old boy who presented to the emergency department for clinical evaluation for acute abdomen. History and clinical examination was suggestive of acute bowel obstruction. Abdominal x-ray showed a large, distended gas filled viscus with base pointed towards the right lower quadrant. On the bases of radiological investigations, diagnosis of cecal volvolus made. Accordingly, the patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. The post operative course was uneventful and was discharged in stable condition. Cecal volvulus is an extremely rare manifestation of intestinal obstruction and malrotation. The clinical presentation of cecal volvulus depending on the duration and extent of the involvement of cecal malrotation The exact pathogenesis of cecal volvulus is unclear. However the association of the embryological development of the colon, affects the attachment to the posterior parietal peritoneum after ordinary anatomical rotation of 270°. The core-stone management of cecal volvulus is surgical approach. Cecal volvulus requires a high index of suspicion and delicate care by the pediatric surgeon as it is considered an extremely rare entity in this age group. We highlighted the significance of early diagnosis, surgical treatment and the possibility of developing postoperative complications if left untreated."

    "title": "Association between chiropractic spinal manipulation and cauda equina syndrome in adults with low back pain: Retrospective cohort study of US academic health centers.",
    "abstract": "Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a lumbosacral surgical emergency that has been associated with chiropractic spinal manipulation (CSM) in case reports. However, identifying if there is a potential causal effect is complicated by the heightened incidence of CES among those with low back pain (LBP). The study hypothesis was that there would be no increase in the risk of CES in adults with LBP following CSM compared to a propensity-matched cohort following physical therapy (PT) evaluation without spinal manipulation over a three-month follow-up period. A query of a United States network (TriNetX, Inc.) was conducted, searching health records of more than 107 million patients attending academic health centers, yielding data ranging from 20 years prior to the search date (July 30, 2023). Patients aged 18 or older with LBP were included, excluding those with pre-existing CES, incontinence, or serious pathology that may cause CES. Patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) LBP patients receiving CSM or (2) LBP patients receiving PT evaluation without spinal manipulation. Propensity score matching controlled for confounding variables associated with CES. 67,220 patients per cohort (mean age 51 years) remained after propensity matching. CES incidence was 0.07% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.05-0.09%) in the CSM cohort compared to 0.11% (95% CI: 0.09-0.14%) in the PT evaluation cohort, yielding a risk ratio and 95% CI of 0.60 (0.42-0.86; p = .0052). Both cohorts showed a higher rate of CES during the first two weeks of follow-up. These findings suggest that CSM is not a risk factor for CES. Considering prior epidemiologic evidence, patients with LBP may have an elevated risk of CES independent of treatment. These findings warrant further corroboration. In the meantime, clinicians should be vigilant to identify LBP patients with CES and promptly refer them for surgical evaluation."

    "abstract": "Advanced and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) presenting with surgical emergencies are rare. Neoadjuvant imatinib being the treatment of choice for non-metastatic advanced disease with a proven role in downstaging the disease may not be feasible in patients presenting with bleeding and obstruction. We present a case series with retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients with advanced and metastatic GISTs presenting with surgical emergencies. Clinical characteristics, imaging and endoscopic findings, surgical procedures, histological findings, and outcomes in these patients were studied. Four patients were included in this case series, with three males and one female (age range: 24-60 years). Two patients presented with melena; one with hemodynamic instability despite multiple blood transfusions underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy for bleeding gastric GIST, while the other underwent surgical exploration after careful evaluation given the recurrent, metastatic disease with a stable metabolic response on six months of imatinib. One patient with metastatic jejunal GIST who presented with an umbilical nodule and intestinal obstruction was given a trial of non-operative management for 72 hours, but due to non-resolution of obstruction, segmental jejunal en bloc resection with the dome of the urinary bladder with reconstruction and metastasectomy was needed. The patient with advanced gastric GIST who presented with gastric outlet obstruction was resuscitated, and an attempt of endoscopic naso-jejunal tube placement was tried, which failed, and exploration was needed. The mean length of hospital stay was 7.5 days. Histopathological examination confirmed GIST in all four patients with microscopic negative resection margins. All patients were started on imatinib with dose escalation to 800 mg in the patient with recurrent and metastatic disease; however, the patient with bleeding gastric GIST experienced severe adverse effects of imatinib and discontinued the drug shortly. All four patients are disease-free on follow-ups of 15 months, 48 months for the patient with advanced non-metastatic disease, and six and 24 months for the patients with metastatic disease. In the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for advanced and metastatic disease, upfront surgery is usually reserved for surgical emergencies only. Surgical resection, the cornerstone for the treatment of resectable GIST, may also be clinically relevant in metastatic settings, although it requires a careful and individualized approach."

    "abstract": "Vaginal evisceration is a rare surgical emergency in which intra-abdominal contents protrude through a dehisced vaginal cuff, which can lead to bowel ischemia and abdominal sepsis. This condition occurs due to vaginal cuff weakness secondary to prior surgeries or trauma. Recurrence after repair is rare and few cases have been documented. Here we present a young woman with multiple prior gynecologic surgeries who presented with eviscerated small bowel and omentum from her vagina five months following surgical treatment of a previous vaginal evisceration. Via a transabdominal surgical approach, general surgery and gynecology teams reduced the intra-abdominal contents, resected a pedicle of necrotic omentum, suture repaired the vaginal cuff, and placed a dehydrated placental allograft. This extremely rare case of recurrent vaginal evisceration demonstrates the importance of taking appropriate preventative surgical measures, maintaining a healthy level of suspicion for recurrence, knowing potential complications, and educating patients to prevent recurrent vaginal evisceration."

    "abstract": "Cecal foreign bodies are uncommon causes of acute abdomen, and their presentation can often mimic acute appendicitis (AA), making it challenging to diagnose. The authors present the case of a 12-year-old male from Ethiopia who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of AA. However, during surgery, the authors found a multiple magnetic fields result in perforation. This case highlights the importance of considering unusual etiologies. A 12-year-old boy with AA associated with anorexia, nausea, and low-grade fever was referred from a private clinic. Otherwise, no history of recent respiratory infection and diarrhea, and was previously in good health. The patient did not report any history of a foreign body (FB), even to his own family, and, except for himself, no one was aware of the ingested FB. The work has been reported in line with the Surgical CAse REport (SCARE) 2023 criteria. In this case, the authors experienced multiple magnetic FB in the cecum, which were not observed on ultrasound (U/S). However, this case closely resembled appendicitis. U/S can aid in differentiation. However, it may not always identify the underlying etiology, specifically in a resource-limited setting. Based on the patient's presentation, AA was diagnosed and emergency surgery was presumed to be inflamed. However, three magnetic FB were the underlying cause of the presentation, which created pressure on the cecal wall, and the authors successfully performed surgical management. This case reminds us of uncommon etiologies, such as magnets in patients with symptoms of appendicitis. This underscores the importance of an open-minded approach to unexpected findings during surgery."

    "abstract": "Common mesentery is an abnormal rotation of the primary umbilical loop characterized by inverted positioning of the mesenteric vessels; the mesenteric vein is displaced to the left of the artery. The inversion can be complete or incomplete. If it is incomplete, the mesenteric root is very short, with an empty right iliac fossa and the caecum in high median or subhepatic position. If it is complete, the entire small intestine is on the right, the entire large intestine is on the left; there is no third duodenum, and the second duodenum is anastomosed in the jejunum to the right of the superior mesenteric vessels. Cecal volvulus is a rarely encountered cause of acute intestinal occlusion and should be considered as a surgical emergency. There exist two main types of volvulus: by twisting of the large intestine around its axis, which remains in place; or by tilt and to rotation of the colon, which changes position."

Outcomes for the jejunal ileal atresia (JIA), the most common subtype of atresia in low-income countries (LIC), are poor. We sought to assess the impact of utilizing the Bishop-Koop (BK) approach to JIA in improving outcomes. A retrospective cohort study was performed on children with complex JIA (Type 2-4) treated at our national referral hospital from 1/2018 to 12/2022. BK was regularly used starting 1/1/2021, and outcomes between 1/2021 and 12/2022 were compared to those between 1/2018 and 12/2020. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. A total of 122 neonates presented with JIA in 1/2018-12/2022, 83 of whom were treated for complex JIA. A significant decrease (p = 0.03) was noted in patient mortality in 2021 and 2022 (n = 33, 45.5% mortality) compared to 2018-2020 (n = 35, 71.4% mortality). This translated to a risk reduction of 0.64 (95% CI 0.41-0.98) with the increased use of BK. Increased use of BK anastomoses with early enteral nutrition and decreased use of primary anastomosis improves outcomes for neonates with severe JIA in LIC settings. Implementing this surgical approach in LICs may help address the disparities in outcomes for children with JIA."

    "abstract": "Nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is a surgical emergency, usually managed via endoscopy. Approximately 2% of patients will have another significant bleed after therapeutic endoscopy and may require either transarterial embolization (TAE) or surgery. In 2011, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommended that TAE should be the preferred option offered in this setting. This study aimed to conduct an appraisal of guidelines on NVUGIB using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. A specific review of their recommendations on the management of adult patients with failed endoscopic hemostasis that required TAE or surgery was conducted. The quality of the guidelines was moderate; most could be recommended with changes. However, their recommendations regarding TAE vs surgery were widely heterogeneous. A closer review of the underpinning evidence showed that most studies were retrospective, with a small sample size and missing data. Because of the heterogeneity in evidence, the decision regarding TAE vs surgery requires further research. Deciding between these modalities is primarily based on TAE availability and patient comorbidities. However, surgery should not be dismissed as a key option after failed endoscopic hemostasis."

Internal hernias can be acquired or congenital. Congenital internal hernias resulting in small bowel obstruction are extremely rare, even more so in adults, occurring usually due to embryological or developmental defects, often undiagnosed, and requiring a high index of clinical suspicion. We report a rare case of a 22-year-old young adult with transmesenteric hernia of distal ileum through a congenital distal ileal mesenteric defect resulting in closed-loop small bowel obstruction and distal ileal gangrene, managed with resection and end-ileostomy, followed by stoma reversal one month later. It requires a high index of suspicion and remains a surgical emergency due to its predilection for intestinal gangrene and small bowel obstruction, with a high mortality rate due to delayed presentation and diagnosis."

According to the published series, there are only 15 cases reported with such kind of injury to the larynx. Despite the rarity of the non-traumatic larynx fracture, it is important to elucidate adequate management for the patients with such emergency. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the features of clinical manifestations, examination, and surgical treatment of a case of spontaneous longitudinal rupture of the thyroid cartilage. A 54-year-old male patient presented with chief complaints of pain in the front surface of the neck, difficulty swallowing and breathing during physical exertion, hyperemia of the skin on the front surface of the neck, and the presence of subcutaneous emphysema. 20 h after the onset of the symptoms, the patient reported breathing difficulties that appeared during physical exertion, and the patient walked to the hospital. Computed tomography revealed a longitudinal rupture of the thyroid cartilage, emphysema of the neck, and the presence of air in the anterior-upper mediastinum. The defect of the ruptured thyroid cartilage was treated by suturing as well as by myoplasty using sternocleidomastoid muscle. Our case report is in line with others, showing that patient with spontaneous rupture of the thyroid cartilage is the surgical emergency. Our approach of using myoplasty was not presented before. This case report adds evidence and knowledge about such rare disorders as spontaneous rupture the thyroid cartilage rupture. It is useful to apply the technique of myoplasty with sternocleidomastoid muscle flaps, ensuring reliable sealing of the damaged area reducing the risk of failure, and inflammatory complications, and supporting neck functions in the postoperative period."

A 47-year-old female patient presented with subjective fever and severe epigastric and left flank pain. She was treated empirically with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and gentamicin and was resuscitated with intravenous crystalloid infusion. A radiological diagnosis of splenic infarct secondary to splenic artery aneurysm superimposed with splenic abscess was presumed, however at emergency laparotomy, primary splenic abscess was identified. This abscess had eroded the left hemidiaphragm and had ruptured the splenic capsule leading to intra-abdominal pus in the pelvis which on culture grew Salmonella Typhimurium. A splenectomy and primary repair of the left hemidiaphragm were performed, with postoperative pancreatitis diagnosed following the procedure. After intensive care treatment, this patient made a full recovery. This case of primary splenic abscess was treated successfully with a combination of surgery (i.e.: splenectomy and surgical drainage), prolonged antimicrobial therapy, and intensive care in the perioperative period."

    "abstract": "A cavernous malformation of the optic nerve (CMON) is a rare condition that often presents with an abrupt decline in vision. Acute management of ruptured optic nerve cavernous malformations is generally surgical, although the timing of surgery is controversial. A 47-year-old female experienced the sudden loss of vision in her left eye. Examination showed that this eye was nearly blind, and her right eye had a temporal field defect. Neuroimaging showed hemorrhage in her left optic nerve and optic chiasm. She was taken to the operating room on an emergent basis where the optic canal was decompressed, the hemorrhage was evacuated, and a vascular malformation with features of a cavernoma was removed from the optic nerve. Over the next 2 days, the vision in her right eye significantly recovered. CMONs remain rare, and it is unlikely that enough cases can be gathered to form a larger trial to compare the role and timing of surgery. On the basis of our experience with this case, the authors recommend that acute CMON-related hematomas should be treated as a surgical emergency and managed with acute optic nerve decompression, hematoma evacuation, and cavernoma resection to improve chances of vision recovery and prevent further vision loss."

Retrospective evaluation of medical record and hospital trauma registry data on canine trauma cases. University teaching hospital. One thousand six hundred and thirty dogs presenting for traumatic injury between May 2017 and July 2020. None. Demographics and outcome were compared for canine trauma patients undergoing OR surgery (12.8%, 208/1630), ER surgery (39.1%, 637/1630), or no surgical intervention (48.2%, 785/1630). Among the 2 surgical groups, 98.9% (836/845) survived to discharge compared with 92.2% (724/785) of the nonsurgical group (P < 0.0001). The OR surgical group had significantly higher median Animal Trauma Triage scores (2 vs 1, P < 0.0001) and median days in hospital (2 vs < 1, P < 0.0001) compared with the other groups. For the OR surgical cohort, electronic medical records were reviewed to determine the specialty surgery service involved, time to and duration of anesthesia and surgery, and visit cost. The most common surgery services involved were orthopedics (45.2%, 94/208) and general surgery (26.9%, 56/208). Neurology and general surgery cases required the longest median length of stay in hospital, and ophthalmology and dentistry cases required the shortest. The median cost of visit was highest in neurology ($10,032) and lowest in ophthalmology ($2305) and dentistry ($2404). Surgical intervention in canine trauma patients appears to be associated with higher survival rates, and among the surgery groups, mortality was highest in the ER and general surgery groups. OR surgical intervention, in particular general surgery and neurology, was associated with increased length of hospitalization, increased cost, and higher Animal Trauma Triage scores."

    "abstract": "Introduction Gallbladder disease accounts for a significant percentage of surgical admissions per year. A review of these cases was done to assess their hospital impact with an evaluation of the efficacy of radiological modalities in terms of evaluation, ideal use, and clinical application. Therefore, this study aims to review the demographics of the disease, the diagnostic yield of radiological modalities, and the overall outcome in regards to the hospital policies and medical services provided in hopes of achieving suitable clinical pathways, increasing the efficiency of gallbladder disease assessment, and limiting unwarranted investigations. Methods This is a single-center, retrospective study that included all the surgical emergency admissions from January 1st to December 31st 2018, in the Salmaniya Medical Complex, Kingdom of Bahrain. A total sample of 163 emergency admissions (cases) was selected from those aged 14 and older with documented biliary stones or biliary-related disease. A review of radiological modalities for diagnosis included plain radiographs (AXR, CXR), US abdomen, CT scans, and MRCP/MRI, which were then correlated with histopathological findings confirming the presence of gallstone disease. In addition to evaluating readmissions and emergency visits in terms of hospital burden. Results One hundred and sixty-three (10.44%) of 1,562 surgical admission cases in 2018 were diagnosed with biliary tree disease (76 males, 87 females). A total of 419 different radiological investigations were requested in 161 of the cases evaluated: 53.7% of plain radiographs (AXR, CXR), 33.2% of US abdomen, 11.9% of CT scan, and 1.2% of MRCP/MRI. Ultrasound showed a sensitivity of 48.72% and a specificity of 100%, while CT scan sensitivity was 57.14% and a specificity of 100% when it came to detecting gallstones and gallbladder-related disease. Plain radiographs add no direct benefit to diagnosing biliary disease.  Conclusion Gallbladder disease is very prevalent with a wide array of disease entities, requiring radiological assistance in diagnosis. Ultrasound is the ideal modality for the diagnosis of biliary disease due to its ease of use and availability; it has high sensitivity and specificity, and it can be complemented by other modalities such as CT scans and MRCP/MRI when it comes to assessing for complications. On the other hand, plain radiographs have no significant value in the detection of gallbladder-related disease, and their utilization should be limited to emergency cases with high clinical suspicion."

To our knowledge, there has been no previous case report of spleno-sigmoid knotting before our case. Here, we present the case of an 18-year-old female patient who visited the surgical emergency outpatient department with diffuse and progressive abdominal pain lasting for one and a half days. She also experienced obstipation and frequent episodes of vomiting of ingested matter. Upon initial evaluation, she exhibited tachycardia and tachypnea, and her abdomen was grossly distended with diffuse direct and rebound tenderness. Further investigation revealed significant leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance. Emergency laparotomy was performed with a possible diagnosis of generalized peritonitis secondary to gangrenous sigmoid volvulus, which revealed gangrenous spleno-sigmoid knotting. Various types of intestinal knots have been reported, with ileo-sigmoid knots being the most common and ileo-ileal knots being the rarest. Wandering spleen is a rare congenital anomaly with a variable clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to mild abdominal pain or acute abdomen due to torsion or acute pancreatitis. It can also cause intestinal obstruction, which may be the initial presentation. In patients presenting with acute abdominal pain and features of bowel obstruction, the possibility of spleno-sigmoid knotting should be considered, and early intervention should be instituted to prevent gangrenous progression and sepsis."

In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the medical records of 117 patients with AADA, who were referred to our centre and operated on between 2005 and 2021. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analysed and tested for their correlation with in-hospital mortality. The overall survival rate was 83%. Preoperatively, factors associated with mortality were age (p = 0.02), chronic hypertension (p = 0.02), any grade of aortic valve stenosis in the patient's medical history (p = 0.03), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.04), and oral anticoagulation (p = 0.04). Non-survivors had significantly longer operative times (p = 0.002). During the postoperative phase, mortality was strongly associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) (p < 0.001), acute heart failure (p < 0.001), stroke (p = 0.02), focal neurological deficits (p = 0.02), and sepsis (p = 0.001). In the multivariate regression analysis, the onset of postoperative focal neurological deficits was the best predictor of a fatal outcome after adjusting for ARDS (odds ratio: 5.8, 95%-CI: 1.2-41.7, p = 0.04). In this retrospective analysis, atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation, hypertension, and age were significantly correlated with mortality. Postoperatively, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure, sepsis, and focal neurological deficits were correlated with in-hospital mortality, and focal neurological deficit has been identified as a significant predictor of fatal outcomes. Early detection and interdisciplinary management of at-risk patients remain crucial throughout the postoperative phase."

Timely and accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance as any delay in definitive surgical management can lead to increased patient's mortality and morbidity with up to 25% of mesenteric aneurysms may be complicated by rupture."

    "title": "Retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis mimicking perforated appendicitis: A case report.",
    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare and rapidly progressing soft tissue infection. The commonly involved body parts are the extremities and trunk. Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) involving the retroperitoneum is very uncommon but associated with higher morbidity and mortality. There are only a few patients survived according to the report. This is a 19-year-old male patient presented with abdominal pain, high-grade fever, vomiting and abdominal distension for 3 days. On physical examination, he was hypotensive, tachycardic and febrile. He had a distended, tender abdomen, and hypoactive bowel sound. There were no significant pertinent findings on the other systems. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. After optimizing with resuscitation and initiating antibiotics, a laparotomy was performed. The finding was 300 ml of hemorrhagic fluid, ischemic cecum and ascending colon, and retroperitoneal necrosis. Subsequently, multiple debridement and right hemicolectomy with stoma was performed. Despite the close monitoring in the ICU, the patient died of uncontrolled sepsis. Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressing infectious condition that requires urgent intervention. While it is rare for the retroperitoneum to be affected by NF, it is associated with a high mortality rate. The symptoms of retroperitoneal NF are not specific, making it difficult to diagnose. Here, we present a case of retroperitoneal NF with signs and symptoms of generalized peritonitis, resembling perforated appendicitis. When patients are presented with a case of generalized peritonitis, it is important to include retroperitoneal NF as a potential differential diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the clinical features of acute terminal ileitis in children and evaluate its rate before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective study was performed in our pediatric emergency department between 2018 and 2022. The records of 5363 patients who required abdominal imaging due to acute abdomen were analyzed, and 143 patients with terminal ileitis were included. The rate and etiological causes were compared during and before the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate of acute terminal ileitis has increased over the years. The fastest increase was in 2021, when the COVID-19 pandemic was experienced. While 59 (41.2%) patients showed acute nonspecific ileitis, the most common etiologic cause that could be identified was acute gastroenteritis. It was determined that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children was among the causes of ileitis after the COVID-19 pandemic and was one of the top three causes. Acute terminal ileitis, which has many etiologies, is one of the rare radiological findings in acute abdominal pain. Examination and laboratory findings are not specific. Guidelines are needed for the investigation of the underlying etiology of acute terminal ileitis in children. The incidence of acute terminal ileitis is increasing, and the increase has been found to be faster after the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "title": "Level of Knowledge and Attitude Toward Acute Abdomen Among the Public: A Nationwide Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Treatment of patients suffering from acute abdominal pain (AAP) is often challenging due to its wide range of associated illnesses, which could delay or prevent the identification of the correct diagnosis. Multiple diagnoses should be considered, particularly those in life-threatening situations needing urgent intervention. Aim This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge among the general population related to acute abdomen and which specialty should be sought for consultation in AAP situations. Subject and methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population living in Saudi Arabia. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to the Saudi population through the Google survey. The questionnaire included basic demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, etc.), perceived causes, barriers, the most common symptoms of AAP, and a five-item questionnaire to assess the general population's knowledge about AAP. Results Of the 2,703 respondents, 68.1% were females, and 42.4% were aged between 18 and 25 years old. The digestive system disorders (esophagus, stomach, intestine, and colon) were the most perceived causes that led to AAP (76.6%). The overall mean knowledge score was 1.35 (SD 1.07) out of five points. Accordingly, nearly all (87.2%) were considered to have poor knowledge, 9.5% were considered to have moderate knowledge, and only 3.3% were considered to have good knowledge. Being younger, being a male, and living in the Central Region were the factors associated with increased knowledge. Conclusion There was a lack of knowledge about AAP among the general population in Saudi Arabia. Younger age, gender males, and living in the Central Region were identified as the significant factors of increased knowledge. It is necessary to increase the knowledge of the population regarding acute abdomen. Media awareness campaigns may play a significant role in providing the necessary information to the general public."

    "abstract": "Total serum bilirubin concentration (TBIL) can provide useful information on several pathophysiological conditions in cats. Nevertheless, whether the variable severity classification of hyperbilirubinemia can reliably indicate certain disease processes or predict a biliary obstruction (BO) has not been investigated. Determine if hyperbilirubinemia of variable severity can assist clinicians to identify BO, which often is considered a surgical emergency. Two-hundred sixteen client-owned cats. Data were retrospectively collected from all cats (January 2015-August 2022) with an increased TBIL (>0.58 mg/dL [>10 μmol/L]) presented to 3 referral centers in the United Kingdom (UK). Presenting clinical features and diagnostic outcomes were collected. The predictive ability of TBIL to indicate BO was evaluated by multivariable binary logistic regression modeling and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Median TBIL was 1.73 mg/dL (range, 0.59-26.15; 29.5 μmol/L; range, 10.1-447.1) with severity classification of hyperbilirubinemia categorized as mild (>0.58-2.92 mg/dL; >10-50 μmol/L; 68.1%), moderate (>2.92-5.85 mg/dL; >50-100 μmol/L; 17.6%), severe (>5.85-11.70 mg/dL; >100-200 μmol/L; 9.7%) and very severe (>11.70 mg/dL; >200 μmol/L; 4.6%). Biliary obstruction was present in 17 (7.9%) cats, all of which received recommendation for emergency surgery. Median TBIL in cats with BO (9.69 mg/dL; 165.7 μmol/L) differed significantly from those without obstruction (1.51 mg/dL; 25.8 μmol/L; P < .01). The optimal TBIL cut-off to discriminate between cats with and without BO was ≥3.86 mg/dL (≥66 μmol/L) with a sensitivity of 94.1% and specificity of 82.4%. Using multivariable logistic regression, as age increased, the odds of BO increased significantly (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.42; P = .04). As part of a thorough clinical assessment, the severity classification of hyperbilirubinemia has the potential to predict the likelihood of a BO and to discriminate between cats that may or may not require surgery for BO at a suggested cut-off of ≥3.86 mg/dL (≥66 μmol/L). Alongside TBIL, age is also useful when assessing for the likelihood of BO in a cat presented with hyperbilirubinemia."

    "abstract": "A 53-year-old Japanese man presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain and bloating. Computed tomography revealed a thickening of the jejunal wall and proximal dilation. Double-balloon enteroscopy was performed to investigate the jejunal thickening, which revealed an anisakis larva in the jejunum with an associated ulcer. The larva was removed using endoscopic forceps, after which there was immediate improvement of symptoms. Further patient interview determined that he had consumed marinated mackerel the day before the onset of symptoms. After diagnosis of small intestinal anisakiasis, he was successfully treated using double-balloon enteroscopy. Its use for small intestinal anisakiasis is rare, and this case may be the first instance in the jejunum. Removal of the anisakis larva led to a clear diagnosis and a quick resolution of symptoms. A history of raw fish consumption a few days before the onset of abdominal symptoms and abnormal findings on computed tomography scans are key to the diagnosis of small intestinal anisakiasis. Double-balloon enteroscopy was thought to be a safe means of making accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment of our patients."

    "abstract": "Torsion of pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma of the uterus is a rare cause of acute abdomen. A 27-year-old female patient with twisted subserosal pedunculated uterine leiomyoma misdiagnosed as an adnexal mass underwent laparotomy. The patient came to the Emergency Department of General Hospital of Trikala with symptoms of acute abdomen. Primarily, clinical-laboratory examination, transabdominal ultrasound, raised the suspicion of a twisted adnexal mass. Intraoperatively, a twisted pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma of the uterus was identified and myomectomy was performed. Histological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis. On the third postoperative day, our patient was discharged. This paper underscores the rarity of torsion of the uterine pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma and emphasizes the necessity of urgent surgical intervention. The challenges of preoperative diagnosis are highlighted, especially when modern diagnostic imaging modalities are unavailable."

    "title": "Tryptase in Acute Appendicitis: Unveiling Allergic Connections through Compelling Evidence.",
    "abstract": "The aetiology of acute appendicitis (AA), the most frequent abdominal surgical emergency, is still unclarified. Recent epidemiologic, clinical and laboratorial data point to an allergic component in the pathophysiology of AA. Mastocytes participate in the Th2 immune response, releasing inflammatory mediators from their granules upon stimulation by IgE-specific antigens. Among the well-known mediators are histamine, serotonin and tryptase, which are responsible for the clinical manifestations of allergies. We conducted a prospective single-centre study to measure histamine and serotonin (commercial ELISA kit) and tryptase (ImmunoCAP System) concentrations in appendicular lavage fluid (ALF) and serum. Consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with a clinical diagnosis of AA were enrolled: 22 patients with phlegmonous AA and 24 with gangrenous AA The control group was composed of 14 patients referred for colectomy for colon malignancy. Appendectomy was performed during colectomy. Tryptase levels were strikingly different between histological groups, both in ALF and serum (p < 0.001); ALF levels were higher than serum levels. Tryptase concentrations in ALF were 109 times higher in phlegmonous AA (APA) (796.8 (194.1-980.5) pg/mL) and 114 times higher in gangrenous AA (AGA) (837.4 (272.6-1075.1) pg/mL) than in the control group (7.3 (4.5-10.3) pg/mL. For the diagnosis of AA, the discriminative power of serum tryptase concentration was good (AUC = 0.825), but discriminative power was weak (AUC = 0.559) for the differential diagnosis between APA and AGA. Mastocytes are involved in AA during clinical presentations of both phlegmonous and gangrenous appendicitis, and no significant differences in concentration were found. No differences were found in serum and ALF concentrations of histamine and serotonin between histological groups. Due to their short half-lives, these might have elapsed by the time the samples were collected. In future research, these determinations should be made immediately after appendectomy. Our findings confirm the hypersensitivity type I reaction as an event occurring in the pathogenesis of AA: tryptase levels in ALF and serum were higher among patients with AA when compared to the control group, which is in line with a Th2 immune response and supports the concept of the presence of an allergic reaction in the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis. Our results, if confirmed, may have clinical implications for the treatment of AA."

The authors report a rare case of disseminated appendicular lymphoma presenting as acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. This case involved a 75-year-old male patient who underwent appendectomy, revealing an enlarged appendix with lymphomatous nodules. Lymphoma involvement in the appendix is extremely rare, and lymphomas presenting as acute appendicitis are even more exceptional. Imaging investigations, including ultrasound and CECT scan of the abdomen, are recommended to aid in diagnosis. On computed tomography, appendiceal lymphoma is characterized by markedly diffuse mural soft-tissue thickening with preserved vermiform morphology and occasional aneurysmal dilatation of the lumen. This case underscores the importance of considering unusual etiologies in atypical appendicitis presentations."

The causative agents may be divided into spontaneous, traumatic, iatrogenic, and miscellaneous. The majority (∼ 90%) of cases are attributed to hollow viscus perforation which requires immediate surgical attention. Neonatal pneumoperitoneum is a surgical emergency unless proven otherwise. A distinct entity termed benign pneumoperitoneum occurs in the absence of clinical and paraclinical features of peritonitis. Benign pneumoperitoneum may be caused by various thoracic, abdominal, and gynecological conditions. In neonates with respiratory distress pneumoperitoneum is a frequent association especially when treated with mechanical ventilation. The air leak phenomenon leads to air tracking from the ruptured alveoli along the interstitium to the mediastinum then to the retroperitoneum and ultimately into the peritoneal cavity. Such patients usually do not require surgical intervention and are managed conservatively. Knowledge of the existence of benign pneumoperitoneum helps to avoid unnecessary surgery thereby reducing operative morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Intestinal ischaemia‒reperfusion (I/R) injury is a surgical emergency. This condition is associated with a high mortality rate. At present, there are limited number of efficient therapeutic measures for this injury, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, the pathophysiological mechanisms of intestinal I/R injury must be elucidated to develop a rapid and specific diagnostic and treatment protocol. Numerous studies have indicated the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the development of intestinal I/R injury. Specifically, the levels of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER lumen are increased due to unfolded protein response. However, persistent ER stress promotes apoptosis of intestinal mucosal epithelial cells through three signalling pathways in the ER, impairing intestinal mucosal barrier function and leading to the dysfunction of intestinal tissues and distant organ compartments. This review summarises the mechanisms of ER stress in intestinal I/R injury, diagnostic indicators, and related treatment strategies with the objective of providing novel insights into future therapies for this condition."

    "abstract": "Background : Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) present a surgical emergency of increasing incidence, which is often misdiagnosed and associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. A retrospective multicenter (11 hospitals) cohort study was initiated to identify the early predictors of misdiagnosis, mortality, and morbidity (skin defect size and amputation). Methods : Patients of all ages who presented with symptoms and were admitted for acute treatment of NSTIs between January 2013 and December 2017 were included. Generalized estimating equation analysis was used to identify early predictors (available before or during the first debridement surgery), with a significance level of P < 0.05. Results : The median age of the cohort (N = 216) was 59.5 (interquartile range = 23.6) years, of which 138 patients (63.9%) were male. Necrotizing soft-tissue infections most frequently originated in the legs (31.0%) and anogenital area (30.5%). More than half of the patients (n = 114, 54.3%) were initially misdiagnosed. Thirty-day mortality was 22.9%. Amputation of an extremity was performed in 26 patients (12.5%). Misdiagnosis was more likely in patients with a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (β = 0.20, P = 0.001), and less likely when symptoms started in the anogenital area (β = -1.20, P = 0.003). Besides the established risk factors for mortality (septic shock and age), misdiagnosis was identified as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (β = 1.03, P = 0.01). The strongest predictors of the final skin defect size were septic shock (β = 2.88, P < 0.001) and a skin-sparing approach to debridement (β = -1.79, P = 0.002). Conclusion : Recognition of the disease is essential for the survival of patients affected by NSTI, as is adequate treatment of septic shock. The application of a skin-sparing approach to surgical debridement may decrease morbidity."

    "abstract": "In this report, we discuss the case of a four-year-old boy known to have global developmental delay (GDD) and infantile spasm. The child was brought to the emergency department (ER) with a tender inguinal swelling and fever. Notably, there was no previous indication of an undescended testicle (UDT), and the scrotum was not examined in the ER initially. The abdominal radiograph was unremarkable, and an ultrasound of the groin was requested to investigate the nature of the swelling. The ultrasound yielded a differential diagnosis of direct or indirect inguinal hernia containing intestinal loops or a necrotic lymph node. Ultimately, scrotal examination and repeated imaging confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral UDT with torsion and suspected infarction on the right side. Both UDT and testicular torsion (TT) are prevalent genitourinary disorders. However, the occurrence of torsion in an undescended testis is not commonly observed or documented, particularly within the age group presented in our case. TT is a surgical emergency, and its prognosis relies on early recognition and management in order to salvage the testis. In this case, there was a missed examination opportunity; therefore, it is imperative for emergency physicians to routinely include scrotal examination as part of the physical assessment when evaluating children with abdominal or groin pain in order to promptly identify such cases."

Only a few cases of transvaginal evisceration have so far been described. The predisposing risk factors associated with this clinical condition are multifactorial. We report a case of an 85-year-old female that presented with spontaneous small bowel evisceration through the vagina. The loops of the small bowel appeared edematous and thickened but there was demonstrable visible peristalsis. She had no previous laparotomy or vaginal surgery. An emergency laparotomy was performed, and the small bowel was reduced into the abdomen through the vaginal defect. Afterward, a total abdominal hysterectomy was performed with the closure of the vaginal vault. The postoperative period was uneventful. The spontaneous evisceration of bowel loops can be successfully managed when patients with such cases present early and promptly managed. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management are crucial to prevent complications. If the eviscerated viscera are non-viable, resection and restoration of bowel continuity are imperative. Management should be individualized and multidisciplinary."

Most cases occur post-trauma, typically affecting the anterior compartment of the leg. Patients present with pain out of proportion to their physical examination findings and often have an early hallmark discovery of pain with passive extension. Compartment syndrome of the buttock requires an even higher index of suspicion, as the condition is even more uncommon, and the diagnosis is complicated by it being difficult to palpate the affected area and passively extend the leg when the patient is supine. This case report presents an 83-year-old female with compartment syndrome of the left gluteal region, status post-fall 1 day earlier. She was admitted to the medical team for observation and failed to respond to narcotic pain medication. The physical examination revealed firm, tense, left gluteal compartments with buttock hematoma and surrounding muscle induration, significant pain, and extremity weakness in the sciatic nerve distribution. An emergent fasciotomy was performed to decompress the affected compartments. All physicians must be mindful of gluteal compartment syndrome in patients complaining of buttock pain, especially after pelvic trauma, who present with buttock swelling, tense gluteal compartments, and severe gluteal pain. A delay in diagnosis or treatment can lead to severe consequences, including disability, irreversible gluteal muscle damage, sciatic nerve dysfunction, kidney failure, or death."

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of exposure to a past disaster or mass casualty incident (MCI) on local hospital surge capacity planning. The current hospital preparedness plans of hospitals receiving surgical emergency patients in Finland were collected (n = 28) and analyzed using the World Health Organization (WHO) hospital emergency checklist tool. The surge capacity score was compared between the hospitals that had been exposed to a disaster or MCI with those who had not. The overall median score of all key components on the WHO checklist was 76% (range 24%). The median surge capacity score was 65% (range 39%). There was no statistical difference between the surge capacity score of the hospitals with history of a disaster or MCI compared to those without (65% for both, P = 0.735). Exposure to a past disaster or MCI did not appear to be associated with an increased local hospital disaster surge capacity score. The study suggests that disaster planning should include structured post-action processes for enabling meaningful improvement after an experienced disaster or MCI."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the world and often requires surgical intervention. One of the complications of appendicitis is abscess formation. In rare cases, a localised abscess can occur in the adjacent organs, such as the iliac and psoas muscles. Sacroiliitis occurring secondary to, or concomitant with, acute appendicitis is extremely rare. However, a missed diagnosis of either or both conditions can lead to serious complications, including mortality. A 27-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a history of acute severe right hip pain that was aggravated by movement and associated with nausea and vomiting. CT suggested acute uncomplicated appendicitis with no localised contamination. He underwent an emergent laparoscopy which showed mild appendiceal inflammation and appendicectomy was performed. He became septic a few hours after the operation, resulting in admission to the high dependency care unit for close observation. On review the following day, he reported ongoing right hip pain and lower back pain with a new onset inability to weight-bear. An MRI scan was performed which showed features of infection around the right sacroiliac joint and Staphylococcus aureus grew in his blood culture. A diagnosis of acute pyogenic sacroiliitis was then made. The patient was treated with IV antibiotics for a total of four weeks, followed by two weeks of oral antibiotics. Acute pyogenic sacroiliitis is one of the rarer conditions seen that can mimic the acute abdomen, in this case acute appendicitis. MRI is the best diagnostic modality in sacroiliitis, in comparison to CT for appendicitis. In most cases of acute appendicitis, mixed bacteria including aerobes and anaerobes are seen in the blood culture while staphylococcus aureus is seen mostly in acute pyogenic sacroiliitis. Staphylococcus aureus-induced appendicitis is reported in less than 3.7 % of cases. An early diagnosis of either or both conditions can significantly reduce complications and, more importantly, expedite implementation of appropriate treatment. In our case we present a combination acute appendicitis, acute sacroiliitis and staphylococcus aureus septicaemia and provide proof that acute pyogenic sacroiliitis can be a rare complication of acute appendicitis. Thus, a high clinical index of suspicion should be considered in the appropriate clinical scenario."

She drank the extracted herbal water to help her when the labor comes, which was made from boiled water with rumput Fatimah from her neighbor's house. Then, she was diagnosed with G2P1A0 parturient aterm latent phase; acute abdomen due to suspicion of placentae abruption dd/ ruptur uteri; and Intrauterine Fetal Death. Exploratory laparotomy was decided due to acute abdominal pain, and during the procedure the operator decided to do subtotal hysterectomy on the patient. The operator found her uterine was already ruptured, approximately 15-18 cm and the placentae was located outside of the uterus. This case suggest that rational usage of herbal medicine must be implemented to avoid unwanted complication."

    "title": "The Role of Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in the Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA), a common reason for episodes of acute abdomen, is a surgical emergency. Its immediate diagnosis and management are of immense significance, as its diagnosis can become challenging at times, especially in resource-limited setups. The goal of this study was to ascertain the threshold value for the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in diagnosing AA and to calculate the validity parameters for the NLR. A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 108 patients who were admitted to the surgical wards of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad with suspicion of AA and subsequently underwent open appendectomy. Data was collected regarding the demography of the patients, physical examination findings, clinical presentations, and investigations including the histopathology and complete blood count, from which the NLR value was computed, and the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was utilized for the computation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was done to calculate the cut-off value of the NLR for diagnosing AA, and validity parameters were computed, taking into account statistical significance with a p-value < 0.05. Based on the ROC analysis, a threshold value for NLR indicating a positive appendectomy was determined to be 2.49 (sensitivity = 71.4% and 1-specificity = 12.5%) with an area under the curve of 90.6% (95% confidence interval {CI} 0.818-0.994, p<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of NLR for diagnosing AA were 71.43%, 87.5%, and 72.73%, respectively. There is a strong correlation between NLR at a cut-off value of 2.49 and the diagnosis of AA. We suggest that NLR should be utilized as a complementary biomarker to clinical examination, aiding in the diagnosis of AA."

    "title": "Prevalence and mortality rate of abdominal surgical emergencies in Sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal surgical emergencies remain prevalent in various healthcare settings, particularly in regions with limited access to basic surgical care, such as Africa. The aim of this literature review is to systematically assess publications on abdominal surgical emergencies in adults in sub-Saharan Africa to estimate their prevalence and mortality rate. A systematic review was conducted. The latest search was performed on October 31, 2022. We estimated the pooled prevalence with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each abdominal surgical emergency, as well as overall postoperative mortality and morbidity rates. A total of 78 studies were included, and 55.1% were single-center retrospective and monocentric studies. The mean age of the patients was 32.5 years, with a sex ratio of 1.94. The prevalence of each abdominal surgical emergency among all of them was as follows: appendicitis: 30.0% (95% CI: 26.1-33.9); bowel obstruction: 28.6% (95% CI: 25.3-31.8); peritonitis: 26.6% (95% CI: 22.2-30.9); strangulated hernias: 13,4% (95% CI: 10,3-16,5) and abdominal trauma: 9.4% (95% CI: 7.5-11.3). The prevalence of complications was as follows: mortality rate: 7.4% (95% CI: 6.0-8.8); overall postoperative morbidity: 24.2% (95% CI: 19.4-29.0); and surgical site infection 14.4% (95% CI: 10.86-18.06). Our study revealed a high prevalence of postoperative complications associated with abdominal surgical emergencies in sub-Saharan Africa. More research and efforts should be made to improve access and quality of patient care."

    "abstract": "Background Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a surgical emergency and has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, it is not known whether mortality from ASDH occurs more frequently in a particular season. Methodology We queried the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) from 2016 to 2019. They were identified in the NSQIP using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code S06.5 to capture all admissions with a primary diagnosis of traumatic subdural hematoma. Mortality rates were reviewed per season, defined as three consecutive months in the year. Demographics such as age, race, ethnicity, height, and weight were reviewed. Comorbidities such as diabetes, risk factors, including smoking history, and hospitalization characteristics, such as admission year, operation year, and inpatient/outpatient treatment type, were also reviewed. Results A total of 1,656 patients were included in this study. The mean age of all participants was 70.6 years, with 37% (604/1,656) being female. The mortality rate was highest in January, February, and March at 24.5% (104/425, P = 0.045) of admitted patients compared to mortality rates of 18.8% (70/373) in April to June, 18.4% (81/441) in July to September, and 17.5% (73/417) in October to December. Conclusions Mortality is significantly greater during the winter months of January, February, and March among patients with ASDH. Despite better survival rates of ASDH over the past two decades, postoperative mortality rates still remain high."

    "abstract": "Thigh compartment syndrome (TCS) is a rare surgical emergency associated with a high risk of morbidity with mortality rates as high as 47 %. There is sparse literature discussing the management as well as outcomes of these injuries. The purpose of this study is to review a consecutive series of patients presenting to a single urban Level 1 trauma center with TCS to identify injury characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes associated with this injury. A trauma database was queried for all patients with a diagnosis of TCS at a single level 1 urban trauma center between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2021. Demographic and injury variables collected included age, sex, BMI, mechanism of injury, and creatine phosphokinase levels (CPK). Hospital quality measures including time from admission to surgery, length of both hospital and ICU stay, complications, and cost of care were collected. Descriptive statistics are reported as median [interquartile range] or N (percent). There were 14 patients identified with a diagnosis of TCS. All were men with an average age 33.5 [23.5 - 38] years and an average BMI of 26 [22.9-28.1]. The most common cause of injury was blunt trauma (71.4 %), and the remaining 28.6 % were gunshot wound injuries. Within the cohort, 6 (42.9 %) patients sustained a femoral shaft fracture, and 4 (28.6 %) patients sustained a vascular injury. The median initial CPK of patients within this cohort was 3405 [1232-5339] and reached a peak of 5271 [3013-13,266]. The median time from admission to diagnosis was 6.8 [0-236.9] hours. The median time from admission to the operating room was 8.2 [0.6-236.9] hours, and the median number of operating room visits was 3 [2 - 6]. Five patients (35.7 %) wounds were closed with split thickness skin grafting. There were 12 (85.7 %) patients who required ICU care. The median ICU length of stay was 7.5 days [4-15]. The median hospital length of stay was 16.5 days [13.25-38.0]. The median total charges for a patient with thigh compartment syndrome was $129,159.00 [$24,768.00 - $587,152.00]. The median direct variable cost for these patients was $86,106.00 For comparison, the median direct variable cost for patients with femur fractures without TCS at this institution was $8,497.28 [$1,903.52-$21,893.13]. No patients required readmission within 60 days. There were no mortalities. TCS is a rare and life-threatening injury associated with significant morbidity. Despite rapid diagnosis and fasciotomy, the majority of the patients have prolonged hospital courses, ICU lengths of stay, and significant costs of treatment. Providers can reference the outcomes reported in this study when caring for TCS patients."

    "title": "\"A successful reconstruction of remnants of corporal bodies and penile urethra after Total Glans Penis amputation following surgical circumcision in a 5-year-old boy\". A case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Circumcision is the most common surgical procedure done in boys. Its complication varies from minor to severe. In most of African countries circumcision is often performed by traditional circumcisers. The management of penile glans amputation depends on the duration before presentation with auto-transplantation being the favorable management in acute phase of presentation. The amputation of the glans is a serious complication of circumcision because it can derange the urinary and sexual functions of a patient and may lead into psychological instability and low self-esteem. We report a case of total glansectomy in a 5-year old boy who presented 12 months after surgical circumcision which was done by inexperienced medical personnel at his house. Patient presented with a pinhole urethra opening, missing glans, buried phallus with remnants of corporal bodies. Penile exploration was done, with successful significant phallus stump of about 5 cm, phallus reconstruction and meatoplasty was achieved. Partial Skin thickness grafting of the phallus stump was performed. At six- month follow up, the patient had both satisfactory cosmetic and functional outcomes. Total glansectomy is a rare surgical emergency with auto transplantation being the best option in acute management however successful outcome for a delayed glansectomy depends on proficient surgical penile exploration and comprehensive post operative care. Based on the clinical presentation, the goals of management for our patient were to achieve a largely patent urethral opening in the long term and to prevent further urethral meatal stenosis as well as achieving adequate phallus stump for sexual function. The amputation of the glans is a serious complication of circumcision because it can derange the urinary and sexual functions of a patient if neglected. Findings on this case report highlight the importance of raising awareness among traditional health care workers to prevent urinary and sexual function disabilities. Prevention of penile amputation can be prevented by providing proper training for circumcisers and providing public education for hospital circumcision."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are a rare form of cancer located within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, defined as tumors with spindle, epithelioid, or occasionally pleomorphic cells. They originate in the interstitial cells of Cajal, with the function of \"pacemaker\" of gastrointestinal motility. Their behavior is dictated by changes in the c-kit/PDGFRA gene, which is often highlighted by immunolabeling. Methods: We report the clinical, macroscopic, microscopic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of consecutive patients diagnosed with GIST who underwent surgical removal of the tumor in our department between 2008-2022. Results: We included 20 consecutive patients. The presentation was considered a surgical emergency requiring immediate surgical intervention in most subjects. The most common localization is the small intestine (n=9, 45%), followed by the stomach (n=7, 35%), colon (n=3, 15%), and peritoneum (n=1, n=5%). Histologically, the tumors were predominantly mixed (n=10, 50%) followed by spindle type (n=8, 40%) and epithelioid - 2 cases (10%). Conclusion: The clinical presentation of GISTs remains heterogeneous, and the diagnosis is predominantly postsurgical, using complex immunohistochemistry analysis. The tumor size and number of mitoses are strongly associated with the long-term prognosis."

    "abstract": "Postoperative internal hernias after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) have an incidence of 2%-9% and are a surgical emergency. Evidence on factors associated with length of stay (LOS) after emergent internal hernia reduction in RYGB patients is limited. This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent internal hernia reduction after RYGB at our tertiary care center over a 5 year period from 2015 to 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and intra- and postoperative hospital course were collected. Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were used to investigate factors associated with LOS. We identified 38 patients with internal hernia after RYGB. These patients with mean age 44.1 years were majority female (71.1%) and white race (60.5%). Of the 24 patients where the RYGB was done at our institution, the mean RYGB to IH interval was 43 months. Petersen's defect (57.8%) followed by jejuno-jejunal mesenteric defect (31.6%) were the most common locations for IH. Both Petersen's and jejuno-jejunal mesenteric hernias were found in 4 cases (10.5%). Revision of bypass and small bowel resection were required in 13.2% and 5.3% of cases, respectively. The median (interquartile range) length of stay (LOS) was 2 days. On the multivariate analysis, male sex (P = .019), conversion to exploratory laparotomy (P = .005), and resection of small bowel (P < .001) were independent risk factors for increased LOS. The most common location of IH after RYGB is Petersen's defect, followed by jejuno-jejunal mesenteric defect. LOS was significantly associated with male sex, exploratory laparotomy, and resection of small bowel."

Wandering spleen is characterized by the displacement of the spleen due to absent or weakened ligaments due to congenital factors or acquired factors such as pregnancy or prior surgery leading to ligament disruption. The 26-year-old patient presented with severe abdominal pain and distention, leading to a diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus secondary to the wandering spleen. This case underscores the importance of considering the wandering spleen in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, especially in patients with a surgical history of gastric sleeve resection. The article emphasizes the critical role of imaging in diagnosis and the necessity of timely surgical intervention to prevent severe complications.

To validate the performance of HI in predicting the presence and nature of peritoneal contamination in patients with acute abdominal pathology in a larger cohort study and to synthesis evidence in a systematic review and meta-analysis. The STROBE guidelines and the PRISMA statement standards were followed to conduct a cohort study (ChiCTR2200056183) and a meta-analysis (CRD42022306018), respectively. All adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for acute abdominal pathology were eligible. The accuracy of the HI was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the cohort study and using weighted summary area under the curve (AUC) under the fixed and random effects modelling in the meta-analysis. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 criteria were used for methodological quality assessment of the included studies. A total of 1437 patients were included (700 from the cohort study and 737 from the literature search). ROC curve analysis of the cohort study showed that the AUC of HI for presence of contamination, purulent contamination and feculent contamination were 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76-0.82, P < 0.0001], 0.76 (95%CI: 0.72-0.80, P < 0.0001), and 0.83 (95%CI: 0.79-0.86, P < 0.0001), respectively. The meta-analysis showed that the pooled AUC of HI for presence of contamination, purulent contamination and feculent contamination were 0.79 (95%CI: 0.75-0.83), 0.78 (95%CI: 0.74-0.81), and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.77-0.83), respectively. The HI is a strong and accurate predictor of intraperitoneal contamination. Although the available evidence is robust, it is limited to the studies conducted by our evidence synthesis group. We encourage other researchers to validate performance of HI in predicting the presence of intraperitoneal contamination and more importantly in predicting mortality following emergency laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, often resulting in perforation and increased morbidity. Up to 55 % of children with complicated appendicitis may experience a complication such as infection, bowel obstruction, or unplanned hospital re-admission (Blakely et al., 2011 [23]). However, the development of infectious spondylodiscitis following appendectomy is an extremely rare complication, particularly in pediatric patients. We present the first reported case of lumbar spondylodiscitis occurring post-perforated appendicitis in a 14-year-old female, highlighting the importance of recognizing and managing uncommon complications. A previously healthy 14-year-old female underwent urgent appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. Postoperatively, she developed severe back pain and immobility. Imaging revealed early lumbar discitis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the surgical site. The patient received multiple antibiotic regimens, including vancomycin, ceftazidime, and meropenem, resulting in clinical improvement. Infectious spondylodiscitis is typically hematogenously spread or due to direct inoculation. In this case, the spread from a contiguous focus of infection without vascular insufficiency is suspected. The coexistence of appendicitis and spondylodiscitis poses diagnostic challenges, requiring a multidisciplinary approach for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This unique case highlights the need for vigilance in recognizing rare complications of appendicitis, such as infectious spondylodiscitis. Early diagnosis and tailored antibiotic therapy are crucial for optimal outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and risk factors associated with this rare complication."

In regions where neonatal intensive care unit facilities and resources are inadequate and skilled personnel are scarce, not extubating neonates on table, contributes to mortality. Our aim was to assess and compare the on-table extubation rate, extubation time, and postoperative pain scores between opioid and opioid-free anesthesia techniques in neonates undergoing surgical repair of TEF. We conducted a prospective, single-blind, randomized trial over 18 months between January 2021 and June 2022 in Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi on 60 full-term neonates scheduled for TEF surgeries randomly allocated to two groups according to the mode of analgesia administered. Group O were given fentanyl injection 1 µg/kg intravenous (IV) loading dose with IV injection. acetaminophen at 7.5 mg/kg and top-up of 0.25 µg/kg fentanyl IV si opus sit. Group NO were given pre-surgical local infiltration and intercostal block with 0.25% and 0.5% bupivacaine, respectively, with IV acetaminophen at 7.5 mg/kg. Mean age in days, gender distribution, and weight in both groups were statistically comparable. The difference in the number of neonates extubated on table was statistically significant (p =0.002) in group NO compared to group O. Lower mean extubation time was seen in group NO (9.0 min 40.0 secs±3.0 min 3.0 secs) compared to group O (16.0 min 45.0 secs±8.0 min 5.0 secs) (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant (p =0.010) lower Neonatal Infant Pain Scale score in group NO with mean and SD as 1.8±0.8 compared with group O, 2.5±1.1 at 90 min. In neonates undergoing TEF repair, opioid-free anesthesia is a safe and effective method, providing a better extubation rate, faster time to extubation, and better postoperative pain control."

    "abstract": "Intussusception in adults is a rare surgical emergency. Unlike in children, most adult intussusceptions arise from a pathological lead point. Ileal intussusception caused by a submucosal liposarcoma is a particularly rare phenomenon. This report describes the diagnosis and management of adult ileal intussusception secondary to submucosal liposarcoma in adult to provide a reference for future clinical work. A 64-year-old female presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain associated with an 8 h history of intermittent vomiting. Based on physical examination, laboratory investigations, and computed tomography, the most likely diagnosis was ileal intussusception secondary to liposarcoma. Thus, emergency laparotomy was performed. During exploration, an ileal invagination was visualised approximately 30 cm from the ileocecal valve, and a flexible polypoid mass was palpable at the lead point of the intussusception. Subsequently, the patient underwent radical resection of pathological tissues with a primary end-to-end ileal anastomosis. Histopathological examination revealed a well-differentiated submucosal liposarcoma. Postoperatively, the patient recovered uneventfully and was doing well at the 6-month follow-up in the outpatient clinic. Thus, clinicians should consider the origin of submucosal liposarcomas in adult with intussusception. Once ileal intussusception secondary to submucosal liposarcoma is diagnosed, timely radical resection is recommended."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous gastric hematoma is an exceedingly rare condition characterized by the accumulation of blood within the gastric wall without any apparent iatrogenic or traumatic cause. Coagulopathies are the most frequent cause of gastric hematomas. However, other causes include amyloidosis, pancreatitis, visceral vascular aneurysms, endoscopy complications and others. The pathophysiology of spontaneous gastric hematoma is not completely understood. However, it is postulated that it is caused by disruption of submucosal vessels that leads to dissection of the muscularis layer and formation of false lumen. The rarity of this condition increases the challenge of diagnosis, and there is no standard treatment protocol. We present the case of a spontaneous gastric hematoma in a 22-year-old male. He presented to our emergency department complaining of pain in the left flank area lasting for 2 wk. There was no history of trauma, anticoagulant medications or endoscopy procedures. His hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were slightly lower than normal. Multi-slice computed tomography, ultrasound and endoscopy confirmed a gastric intramural hematoma. We recommended conservative treatment because there was no hemodynamic instability nor significant bleeding. The patient responded well, and there were no unexpected events. At the 3-mo follow-up, the ultrasound examination revealed complete regression of the hematoma. After reviewing the literature and our experience, we recommend that more of these cases should be treated conservatively. The tendency to treat these cases with potentially burdensome procedures such as total or subtotal gastrectomy should be significantly reduced."

We retrieved about 30 studies regarding phlegmonous enteritis from 1951 to 2022, with around 39 cases. Among these, only 28 patients had comprehensive medical data available. Subsequently, an examination of the literature was undertaken to explore the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of phlegmonous enteritis. The possibility of phlegmonous enteritis should be taken into consideration in cases of unexplained acute abdomen, particularly in patients with compromised immunity, in order to provide active surgical and antibiotic interventions."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) is a rare surgical emergency, often with acute onset, causing severe spinal cord injury. This report presents a case of SSEH treated by surgery to enhance understanding of this disease. A 76-year-old male patient sought medical care for unexplained sudden chest and back pain and paralysis of both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the occupation of thoracolumbar spinal canal. The blood clot was completely removed by emergency surgery, and then the neurological function recovered. Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma is an uncommon disease, its acute onset, resulting in difficult to recover spinal cord injury, or even permanent paralysis. Therefore, early diagnosis and early operation are the key to the protection of neurological function. Surgical intervention is the first choice for treatment, especially in acute and subacute spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma. Once diagnosed, and there are no contraindications, it is recommended to remove and decompress the hematoma as soon as possible."

    "abstract": "Penile fracture is traditionally considered a surgical emergency warranting immediate repair with the goal to maximize long-term erectile function and minimize penile curvature. Nonetheless, consensus on the optimal timing for penile fracture repair remains to be elucidated and is the subject of continued research efforts. This review aims to summarize the contemporary literature pertaining to optimal timing of penile fracture repair and associated outcomes. We queried PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar for relevant articles published between 2012 and 2022 to evaluate the most recent literature on the queried topic of early vs delayed intervention for penile fracture. All examined review articles were published within the last decade but may have included analyses of studies published prior to 2012. Reference lists of articles and reviews were manually reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. We identified 16 articles that met inclusion criteria: 12 primary articles and 4 systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Importantly, definitions of early and delayed intervention varied greatly among studies, making quantitative comparison challenging. In summary, 6 primary studies and 2 systematic review articles favored early intervention. There were also 6 primary studies and 2 systematic review articles suggesting equivocal outcomes between early and delayed repair. No articles demonstrated improved outcomes with delayed repair relative to early intervention. Surgical intervention for penile fracture remains the gold standard, with superior long-term sexual and functional outcomes when compared with conservative management. Optimal timing of penile fracture repair remains to be elucidated with data limited by low incidence, resulting in small case series and a lack of randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, recent data suggest that a brief delay in surgical intervention for patients presenting with penile fractures does not affect long-term sexual and functional outcomes."

    "abstract": "Littre's hernia (LH) is due to the presence of a Meckel's diverticulum (MD) in a hernial sac. It is an extremely rare condition in less than 1 % of all MD cases. It is often asymptomatic and is diagnosed incidentally during routine surgery for hernia repair. Surgery is the main treatment. Although the management of uncomplicated MD remains controversial, MD's management in the setting of either bowel obstruction or of Littre's hernia is done according to the clinical principles combined with the availability of local expertise. We report a case of an 11-year-old boy presented to the emergency room with a diagnosis of acute obstructive syndrome. Radiological exams were inconclusive. Intra-operatively findings showed a strangulated MD trapped in a small umbilical hernia. A simple wedge resection, followed by a primary closure of the remaining defect was performed. During 12 months of observation the patient remains in good condition. LH is an uncommon type of abdominal wall hernia. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult. Even abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) cannot reveal the right diagnosis and it is generally performed intraoperatively. The main treatment is surgery. Repair of a Littre hernia requires both management of Meckel's diverticulum and repair of the hernia with sutures or mesh. LH is a very rare type of hernia. Diagnosis is very difficult. All surgeons should be aware of this type of hernia to avoid life-threatening complications. The application of hernia repair recommendations for children may anticipate the happening of complicated LH."

    "abstract": "Colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. Approximately one-fifth of colon cancers will present emergently due to obstruction or perforation. Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a rare presentation of perforated colon cancer and represents a surgical emergency due to high mortality rate.  A man in his 80s presented with several days of scrotal pain and weakness. On physical exam he was found to have scrotal edema and erythema and bilateral inguinal hernias. Imaging revealed a large scrotal abscess and concern for necrotizing soft tissue infection. He was taken to the operating room for surgical debridement and exploration and was discovered to have perforated colon within an incarcerated inguinal hernia. He underwent exploratory laparotomy with sigmoid resection and end colostomy creation. Pathology returned demonstrating invasive sigmoid adenocarcinoma. Fournier's gangrene requires a high index of suspicion. It is a rapidly progressing infection associated with high mortality. Early initiation of antibiotics and surgical debridement are mainstays of treatment. When associated with perforated colonic malignancy, workup must include imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level to complete staging. Fournier's gangrene secondary to perforated sigmoid adenocarcinoma is a unique presentation. Treatment first involves antibiotics and aggressive surgical debridement. Once the patient is stabilized, further oncologic workup should be completed to determine treatment course."

    "title": "Suspected Cauda Equina Syndrome: Can the Presence of an Orthopaedic Doctor in the Emergency Department Reduce Waiting Times for MRI Scans and Inpatient Stays?",
    "abstract": "Introduction Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a very rare but devastating surgical emergency that can lead to permanent bowel, bladder or sexual dysfunction and lower limb paralysis. Although it is a clinical syndrome, an MRI scan is a critical diagnostic investigation for these patients and should be done as soon as possible. Our hospital is a district general hospital with no spinal services on site. There is a protocol in place for the management of these patients locally with MRI scanning during daytime hours. However, if the patient presents after 8 pm, they are discussed with the tertiary spinal centre, which then advises if the patient requires transfer overnight for urgent scanning. Considering an MRI scan is a critical diagnostic step for these patients, we introduced a role for an orthopaedic doctor in the Emergency Department (ED) to assess all of these patients before collecting data for the second cycle. The aim of this audit was to see the effect of having an orthopaedic doctor in the ED for the assessment of these patients and its impact on waiting times and admission rates. Methods A closed-loop audit cycle was done looking into all referrals to trauma and orthopaedics with acute back pain and suspected CES in a district general hospital with no spinal services on site. The first cycle was between September 30, 2020, and May 31, 2021, and included 93 patients in total. Following this, a role for an orthopaedic doctor in ED was introduced from December 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022, for assessment of these patients. Data was then collected retrospectively for all patients referred during this period (n=36). Data was extracted from all relevant clinical systems including electronic patient record (EPR), Patient Pass (Patient Pass Ltd, Greater Manchester, England), which is the system used to digitally communicate with regional spinal services, and PACS (picture archiving and communication systems). The data was collated on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washinton, United States) and analysed. Results Data were collected for a total of 36 patients in the second cycle following the introduction of an orthopaedic doctor in the ED. The age of patients referred was 30-89 years with a mean age of 51; 44.4% were male (n=16) and 55.5% female (n=20). All the patients who were referred received their MRI scan and report within 24 hours of presentation to the ED. In the first cycle of the audit, the mean waiting time for an MRI scan had been 12.5 hours, which was reduced to eight hours following the introduction of an orthopaedic doctor in the ED during daytime hours. This was stratified further according to the time patients presented to the hospital. From 8 am to 4 pm, the mean waiting time for an MRI scan was 9.5 hours pre-intervention and 5.5 hours after. From 4 pm to 12 am, the mean waiting time was 18 hours before and 13 hours after, and from 12 am to 8 am, the waiting time for scans improved from 8.5 hours to 6.5 hours. The number of patients discharged on the same day greatly improved from 29% (n=27) in the initial study to 58% (n=21). This decreased unnecessary inpatient stays from 71% (n=66) to 42% (n=15). Conclusion This study showed that an orthopaedic doctor in the ED for the acute assessment of patients referred with possible CES is an effective way of improving their management. This decreases waiting times for MRI scans and therefore allows the patient to be managed more efficiently."

    "abstract": "Background and objective Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is considered a surgical emergency, and its primary treatment involves decompression of the nerve roots, typically in the form of discectomy or laminectomy. The primary aim of this study was to determine the complication, reoperation, and readmission rates within 30 days of surgical treatment of CES secondary to disc herniation by using the PearlDiver database (PearlDiver Technologies, Colorado Springs, CO). The secondary aim was to assess preoperative risk factors for a higher likelihood of complication occurrence within 30 days of surgery for CES. Methods A total of 524 patients who had undergone lumbar discectomy or laminectomy for CES were identified. The outcome measures were 30-day reoperation rate for revision decompression or lumbar fusion, and 30-day readmissions related to surgery. The patient data collected included medical history and surgical data including the number of levels of discectomy and laminectomy. Results Based on our findings, intraoperative dural tears, valvular heart disease, and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities were significant risk factors for readmission to the hospital within 30 days following surgery for CES. The most common postoperative complications were as follows: visits to the emergency department (63 patients, 12%), surgical site infection (21 patients, 4%), urinary tract infection (14 patients, 3%), and postoperative anemia (11 patients, 2%). Conclusions In the 30-day period following lumbar decompression for cauda equina syndrome, our findings demonstrated an 8% reoperation rate and 17% readmission rate. Although CES is considered an indication for urgent surgery, gaining awareness about reoperation, readmission, and complication rates in the immediate postoperative period may help calibrate expectations and inform medical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Medial arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is an anatomoclinical entity underestimated in most situations due to the lack of specific signs. However, the consequences can be disastrous if the diagnosis is not seriously considered and investigations are not fully undertaken to confirm this hypothesis. We report a case of Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome in a young woman who presented to the Emergency Department with moderate postprandial pain. All investigations were carried out promptly, with no abnormalities, and the diagnosis was retained on the evidence of a well-performed and appropriately interpreted abdominal CT. This case illustrates a rare cause of epigastralgia simulating a surgical emergency. This condition should be considered when biological and often radiological investigations are inconclusive. The relative youth of the patient is often suggestive, but confirmation is based on a CT scan with injection of a well-technical contrast product, or angiography. Treatment is debatable between a conservative approach and surgery. Surgical approach is discussed depending on the degree of vascular stenosis and the impact on the digestive tract. However, the recurrence of symptoms may be a contributory factor in the therapeutic decision. The impact could be lethal depending on the degree of stenosis and consequently on the repercussions on the digestive tract. A multidisciplinary approach is required for its management."

    "abstract": "Perforation of hollow organs, such as the stomach, within the abdomen can lead to the development of acute abdomen, a critical and potentially life-threatening condition. It is important to note that there is currently insufficient information available regarding the specific effects of heroin, an illegal substance commonly abused, in causing this particular complication. We present the case of a 32-year-old male who is addicted to heroin and was admitted to an addiction rehabilitation center with the aim of overcoming his addiction. After a few days of admission, the patient developed symptoms of abdominal pain, anorexia, and subsequent neurological manifestations, such as drowsiness, confusion, and a decreased level of consciousness. Tragically, the patient suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest upon arrival at the emergency room and despite efforts to resuscitate him, he unfortunately passed away. During the autopsy of the aforementioned case, an observation was made of a perforation in the stomach, which ultimately led to the cause of death being identified as peritonitis. Acute peritonitis is recognized as one of the potential causes of acute abdomen, often resulting from the rupture of hollow organs within the abdominal region. It is characterized by inflammation of the serous membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. Indeed, conducting original and coherent studies to investigate the potential effects of heroin on gastric perforation could prove to be highly valuable in facilitating the timely diagnosis and treatment of this fatal complication."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening surgical emergency. Though the entity is associated with high mortality and morbidity, with well-executed and timely surgical intervention, mortality and morbidity could be reduced to a reasonable extent. Information about demographics, clinical pattern, and results of management of acute TAAD from the Indian subcontinent largely remains unpublished. There are only a few specialized centers performing aortic operations. Very often, the patients with acute TAAD are operated on by surgeons with limited experience and resources. The surgeon is operating like a \"lone warrior\" without the support of a specialized radiologist, interventionalist, and specialized anesthetist. In most of the hospitals, facilities for sophisticated monitoring, sealants, specialized grafts, and stent graft are not available. We follow a simple algorithm of diagnosis and surgical management. The goal of treatment is to save the life. We follow a conservative approach best suited to our circumstances. Mild hypothermia, carotid cannulation, and antegrade cerebral perfusion as cerebral protection strategies have yielded satisfactory results. In case of organ malperfusion, with some exceptions, we perform aortic repair first. Our policy, towards arch management is less aggressive. In high-risk cases, we perform an endovascular-compliant hemiarch or arch replacement, followed by stent grafting in the post-operative period."

Typically, indirect, rather than direct, hernias lead to complications, as a consequence of their narrower hernial defect. We report a 71-year-old male patient with a rather rare incidence of a direct incarcerated hernia who presented with acute pain in the left inguinal area at a university general hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2017. Upon clinical examination, an irreducible inguinal mass was palpated. Therefore, the existence of a complicated hernia was suspected. The patient underwent an emergency repair, during which it was established that the hernia was direct and incarcerated and that its sac contained an ischaemic epiploic appendage. The hernia was successfully repaired with mesh, the patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged five days later. Despite the rarity of complicated direct inguinal hernias, they should always be included in the differential diagnosis of irreducible groin masses as they can increase severe complications."

    "abstract": "Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound (TPUS) is the diagnostic test of choice for the evaluation of ovarian torsion, a time-sensitive surgical emergency. A full bladder is required to visualize the ovaries. Bladder filling is a time-consuming process leading to delays to TPUS, poor visualization of ovaries requiring repeat studies, and prolonged emergency department length of stay (ED LOS). The primary objective was to decrease the time to TPUS by standardizing the bladder filling process. This quality improvement initiative occurred at a single, academic, quaternary-care children's hospital ED and utilized the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for Improvement with sequential plan-do-study-act cycles. The first set of interventions implemented in August 2021 included a new electronic order set and bladder scan by ED nurses. Subsequent plan-do-study-act cycles aimed to decrease the time to intravenous fluid, decrease fluid requirement, and decrease the need for intravenous fluid. The primary outcome measure was the monthly mean time to TPUS. Secondary outcome measures included monthly mean ED LOS and percentage of repeat TPUS. We performed data analysis with statistical process control charts to assess for system change over time. The preintervention baseline included 292 ED encounters more than 10 months, and postintervention analysis included 526 ED encounters more than 16 months. Time to TPUS decreased (138-120 min), ED LOS decreased (372-335 min), and repeat TPUS decreased (18% to 4%). All changes met the rules for special cause variation. Standardizing the bladder filling process was associated with decreased time to TPUS, ED LOS, and repeat TPUS."

This is especially critical for novice surgeons, who are prone to adopt inadequate switching gaze strategies, thereby increasing the chance of unforeseen complications. In this paper the use of an additional computer-aided vision system was tested for improvement of the reaction of the surgeons to unforeseen complications. Gaze patterns were analyzed using a gaze tracker, as well as other metrics such as task completion time or reaction time to sudden bleeding. While completion time did not show significant difference between tested modalities (p<0.1), the reaction time showed a downward trend as more auxiliary computer-aided vision systems were added (p<0.005). These results support the benefits of including additional vision systems for minimally invasive surgery processes.Clinical Relevance- This work assesses the advantages of including an additional computer vision system to prevent unforeseen complications during minimally invasive surgeries."

Whether routine microbiological testing benefits the individual patient is a topic of debate. The goal of our study was to assess perioperative antibiotic prescriptions as well as the benefit of microbiological testing during the appendectomy as a predictor for bacteria encountered in infectious complications. This is a retrospective analysis of 1218 consecutive patients that underwent appendectomy at a tertiary referral center between 2014 and 2021. The patient charts were systematically analyzed regarding intraoperative outcome, microbiologic results, and postoperative infectious complications. 1218 patients were included in this study of which 768 were uncomplicated appendicitis (UA) and 450 were complicated appendicitis (CA). Microbiological testing was performed in 39.2% of UA cases (33.6% of which grew bacteria) compared to 74.9% of CA cases (78.6% positive cultures). The strongest individual predictors for SSI were gangrenous and perforated appendicitis. A total of 58 surgical-site infections developed, of which 49 were intra-abdominal fluid collections or abscesses. Thirty-two patients had revision surgery or CT-guided drainage for SSI. In the cases where microbiological testing was done both during the appendectomy and the SSI, 13/18 showed different bacteria on culture testing. The infectious outcome was favorable in 98.3%. While microbiological testing offers insights into resistance patterns, it is of little benefit for the individual patient, given the low predictive value for bacteria found during SSI. Achieving source control combined with empiric antibiotic coverage leads to favorable outcomes independent of culture results."

The aims of this retrospective study were to evaluate the prevalence of SIRS response and its clinical relevance in patients diagnosed with PEA within a large tertiary hospital network. A retrospective study was performed on all consecutive adult patients who presented to four major emergency departments with CT-confirmed PEA from 01 January 2022 to 27 March 2023. The fulfilment of SIRS criteria, hospital admission rate and treatments provided were analysed for these patients. Seventy-three patients had CT-confirmed PEA. Seventeen patients (23.2%) with PEA were SIRS positive. The hospital admission rate in the SIRS group trended higher than the non-SIRS group (odds ratio of 2.51, 95% CI (0.75, 8.39)). The odds of having an associated radiological comorbidity unrelated to PEA were 18.7 times higher in the SIRS positive group. Fifty-seven (78%) patients were discharged home, and 16 (22%) patients were admitted into hospital. Nearly all patients were treated conservatively (98.6%). PEA patients with SIRS response trend towards a higher hospital admission rate and are significantly more likely to have other radiological comorbidities than non-SIRS patients. It is important to look for other pathological conditions in a SIRS positive patient with a CT-diagnosis of PEA."

    "abstract": "Adrenal hemorrhage is a rare, but important, diagnosis to recognize, in particular when there is involvement of both adrenal glands. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage can in fact lead to adrenal insufficiency, with dramatic consequences if not promptly recognized and treated. It is normally caused by systemic conditions that lead to the vasoconstriction and thrombosis of the adrenal vein. Oftentimes, the clinical diagnosis of this condition can be very challenging, as its signs and symptoms are generalized and nonspecific (abdominal pain, nausea, and fatigue). Here, we present the cases of two patients admitted to the Emergency Department in 2016 and 2022 with acute abdominal pain, having recently undergone surgery and subsequently prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin. In both cases, laboratory results revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis and an unexplained anemia. Due to the persistence of abdominal pain despite medication, a CT scan was performed, showing an enlargement of both adrenal glands suggestive of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. Adrenal function was tested that correlated with a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, and both patients were promptly treated with parenteral hydrocortisone as a result. On 5 years' follow-up from the acute event, the second patient's adrenal function had returned to normal, and he has not needed further adrenal replacement therapy; the first patient however demonstrated persistence of adrenal failure requiring replacement therapy. In this paper, through our experience and a literature analysis, we will aim to outline some clues to identify patients at potential risk of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "Expectant management, or non-operative management (NOM), with standalone intravenous antibiotic therapy, has emerged as an effective alternative to appendectomy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. Various clinical, biochemical, and radiological factors have been implicated in predicting the success or failure of outcomes. Therefore, it is important to identify patients at the onset who are likely to have successful outcomes for conservative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis. We prospectively enrolled 85 surgical patients diagnosed with uncomplicated acute appendicitis in our study. On admission, clinical features such as duration of symptoms, pulse rate (PR), history of fever within 24 hours of admission, modified Alvarado score and adult appendicitis score, biochemical parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and hematological parameters such as total leukocyte count (TLC) were recorded. Radiological imaging of patients, namely ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT abdomen to evaluate appendix diameter and mural enhancement, was also undertaken. The outcome of expectant management for these patients (success or failure) was recorded, and the above-mentioned factors were evaluated to find a possible correlation with successful expectant management. We found that among 85 patients, 77.6% had a successful NOM of appendicitis, whereas 22.4% had a failed NOM of appendicitis. The duration of symptoms, pulse rate, fever within 24 hours of admission, TLC, percentage of neutrophils, CRP level, appendix diameter, modified Alvarado score, and adult appendicitis score were found to be statistically significant predictors of successful NOM of appendicitis according to univariate analysis. According to multivariable analysis, pulse rate and appendix diameter value were found to be statistically significant predictors of successful NOM of appendicitis. With each beat per minute (bpm) increase in pulse rate, there was a 0.30% decrease in the probability of a successful NOM of appendicitis. With each mm increase in appendix diameter, there was an 82% decrease in the probability of a successful NOM of appendicitis. From our study, it can be concluded that patients who met the following criteria, i.e., duration of symptoms before presenting to surgical emergency less than two days, presence of fever within 24 hours of presenting to surgical emergency, pulse rate >90 bpm, TLC >12000 cells/dL, CRP >20 mg/L, appendix diameter >10 mm, modified Alvarado score ≥ 9, and adult appendicitis score ≥ 18, have a higher probability of failure of NOM and hence should be excluded from expectant management."

Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy, and partial omentectomy were performed in an emergency as the patient's symptoms worsened. A massive cyst was visualized from the right ovary, which had undergone a torsion of three turns. Histopathological analysis revealed a serous cystadenoma. The twisted ovarian cyst typically manifests as an acute abdomen, although there are cases where this presentation can cause a significant delay in diagnosis. Therefore, high clinical suspicion is often necessary to prevent morbidity and mortality."

    "title": "Omental Infarction Mimicking Acute Appendicitis: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in emergency departments, often attributed to a myriad of potential causes. Among these, acute appendicitis remains a frequently diagnosed culprit. However, this case report presents a 32-year-old male who arrived at the emergency department with severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain, characterized by localized tenderness and guarding. The initial clinical diagnosis pointed to acute appendicitis. Before surgical intervention, a computed tomography scan was conducted and revealed a focal area of fat stranding, consistent with omental infarction, while the appendix appeared normal. The patient's management involved pain control and supportive care, leading to a complete resolution of abdominal pain at a two-week follow-up. This case emphasizes the significance of including omental infarction in the spectrum of diagnoses for acute abdominal pain, underlining the potential to prevent unnecessary surgical interventions."

Patients from 2 months to 15 years of age, without comorbidities, who underwent appendectomy for complicated (CAA) and uncomplicated (UCAA) acute appendicitis were included. PAS score prior to an appendectomy was obtained, and the time of HS and postoperative complications were evaluated. 64 patients were evaluated, age 8 (IQR 8-12) years, PAS score 6 (IQR 4-8). The time from the onset of symptoms to the request for care in the emergency department was shorter (p < 0.0001) and the total neutrophil count was higher (p = 0.001) in the CAA group. No difference was shown in the PAS score between patients with CAA and UCAA (6 [4-7] vs. 7 [4-8], p = 0.087].

Four radiologists retrospectively and independently assessed 18 CT signs in 191 patients with cecal volvulus (n = 63) or a non-volvulus control group ((n = 128), including cecal bascule (n = 19), mobile cecum (n = 95), and colonic pseudo-obstruction (n = 14)) at a single institution from 2013 to 2021. Fleiss' kappa coefficient was used to assess inter-reader agreement. For diagnostic performance metrics, we assessed sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. For predictive performance, all 18 signs were included in bivariate and stepwise lasso multivariate logistic regression models to diagnose cecal volvulus. Performance was assessed by ROC curves. 191 patients (mean age: 63 years +/- 15.5 [SD]; 135 women) were included in the study. Nine of the 18 CT signs of cecal volvulus demonstrated good or better (> 0.6) inter-reader agreement. Individual CT signs with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values all above 70% for diagnosing cecal volvulus were transition point, bird beak, and X-marks-the-spot. A lasso regression model determined four CT features: transition point, bird beak, coffee bean, and whirl had excellent prediction (AUC = .979) for cecal volvulus if all present. CT signs for cecal volvulus that have high sensitivity and specificity include: transition point, bird beak, and X-marks-the-spot and were reliable in distinguishing non-volvulus mimickers.

The population had to live confined with their families, which often meant that parents telecommuted while caring for their children. However, daily risks remained more than ever at the forefront. The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiology of burns among children during three different periods of family time: school time, vacation, and lockdown. A single-center retrospective study was conducted at Tours University Hospital. All pediatric surgical emergency room visits recorded from February 10, 2020 to March 31, 2020 were included. The three aforementioned periods were assessed. During lockdown there were significantly more burns compared to other injuries (p = 0.004). Preschool-age children suffered significantly more from burns during the same period (p = 0.029). There were no significant differences for nursery school (p = 0.522), primary school (p = 0.519), middle school (p = 0.613), and high school (p = N) children.

    "abstract": "Abdominal tuberculosis presenting as acute surgical emergency continues to be a major issue in developing countries including India. Being an indolent disease with varied presentation, there is a need to describe the epidemiology, clinicopathological nature of the disease. Hence, this series was conducted with the aim of describing our institutional experience in the management of abdominal tuberculosis presenting as acute surgical emergency, outlining the epidemiology, management aspects and the analysis of risk factors for poor outcome in our population. This was a descriptive series of patients operated for abdominal tuberculosis presenting as acute surgical emergency at a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India from January 2021 to January 2022. All consecutive patients presenting with intestinal obstruction or peritonitis who underwent laparotomy with intra operative and histopathological finding suggestive of tuberculosis were taken for the study. A total of 30 patients with acute abdominal tuberculosis were included in the study. 56.7% of patients were males; the mean age of presentation was 43 years with majority of patients in the younger to middle age groups. Most (80%) patients were from rural areas with limited access to healthcare. One patient had co-infection with HIV. Five patients had diabetes and six patients had hypertension as co-morbidities. 73.3% of patients had primary intestinal tuberculosis. Majority (76.7%) presented with acute intestinal obstruction. All patients had colicky abdominal pain as a consistent feature. 40% of patients were anaemic and 70% had low serum albumin levels. The most common site of affection was Ileo-cecal region (73.3%) with stricture as the pathology. Segmental resection with end to end anastomosis was the most common procedure performed (46.7%). 26.7% of patients had an adverse post operative complication, and 23.3% had surgical site infection (SSI). The mortality rate in our series was 6.7%. Although coexisting SSI, co-morbidities were associated with increased mortality, it was not found to be statistically significant (p = 0.08). 16 patients were lost to follow up. Abdominal tuberculosis presenting as acute abdomen continues to challenge surgeons even in the 21st century. Majority in the developing countries present late with varied complications. A high index of clinical suspicion is required for timely diagnosis to reduce the mortality and morbidity of the disease."

Retrospective review by two experienced radiologists of emergency ultrasounds and CTs performed on patients admitted in the Emergency Department of our hospital with later confirmed anisakiasis (2010-2021), assessing the presence of signs suggesting anisakiasis. Calculation of the frequency of appearance according to the gastric or intestinal location, as well as the most common grouped signs. Out of 231 total patients with anisakiasis, imaging studies were performed in 144: abdominopelvic ultrasound in 43 cases and CT in 111 (both techniques in 31). In cases with gastric occurrence (34), in CT the wall stratification (100%), wall thickening (97%), fat stranding (91%) and ascitic fluid (82%) were predominant. In the intestinal cases (105), in CT (95) the wall thickening (100%), fat stranding (92%) and mesenteric vessel engorgement (83%) were usual; in ultrasound (40), ascitic fluid and wall thickening (70% in both cases) were frequently observed. The frequency of grouped appearance of the mentioned signs was 82% in gastric cases, 80% in intestinal cases and 50% in ultrasounds. Multisegment involvement in CT reached 28% (gastric + intestinal) and 11% (only intestinal) of cases. The most frequent CT findings in patients with gastric anisakiasis are wall stratification and thickening, fat stranding and ascitic fluid. In the intestinal cases, wall thickening, fat oedema and vessel engorgement are the most often observed findings. The presence of different radiological signs makes it advisable to include anisakiasis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. Intestinal and multifocal involvement rates are greater than previously reported. • In gastric anisakiasis, CT frequently shows wall stratification and thickening, fat stranding and ascitic fluid. • In intestinal anisakiasis, CT often presents wall thickening, fat stranding and vessel engorgement. • In intestinal anisakiasis, ultrasounds most frequently show ascitic fluid and wall thickening."

Observational retrospective study that included patients admitted under the general surgery department with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis at King Saud Hospital, Unaizah, Saudi Arabia. Data on age, gender, BMI, diabetes mellitus, total and direct bilirubin, AST, ALT, sodium, and WBCs levels were obtained. Among the overall study population of 158 patients, the age median [IQR] was 24.5 [19-31], males were 99 (62.7%), and complicated appendicitis was 33 (20.9%). The multivariable analysis revealed that both elevated total and direct bilirubin are associated with complicated appendicitis (aOR = 3.79, 95% CI: 1.67-8.48, P = 0.001) and (aOR = 4.74, 95% CI: 2.07-10.86, P < 0.001) respectively. A receiver operating characteristic curve showed the best cutoff value of total and direct bilirubin as ≥ 15 µmol/L and ≥ 5 µmol/L respectively, with a sensitivity of 57.6%, and specificity of 73.6% for elevated total bilirubin, and a sensitivity of 54.6%, and specificity of 80% for elevated direct bilirubin. Elevated total and direct bilirubin are associated with acute complicated appendicitis in this setting. However, it should be supportive factor for acute complicated appendicitis and not considered as standalone diagnostic test."

We retrospectively reviewed medical records from Veterans diagnosed with PD who were under treatment with CCh using the Veterans Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI). Using International Classification of Diseases and Current Procedural Terminology codes, we identified men who suffered a corporal rupture after CCh. Individual charts were reviewed to determine potential risk factors and events leading to corporal rupture. We identified 17,647 veterans who were diagnosed with PD, of which 8.7% (1541) received at least one injection of CCh for PD. Of them, 0.7% (11/1541) veterans suffered corporal rupture. Within these 11 patients, the median number of CCH injections was 6 with a median initial curvature of 35°. Fracture occurred at a median of 8days after CCH injection. The majority of fractures were secondary to spontaneous erections or sexual intercourse. Finally, six patients had their fracture repaired surgically while the remaining were managed conservatively. Most fractures occurred within 2weeks of CCh injections and were associated with sexual intercourse and spontaneous morning erections."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection Stanford type A (AADA) is a surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for AADA at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). More pericardial tamponade (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of postoperative stroke was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young AADA patients. Exemptions, like known Marfan syndrome and the presence of an intimal tear in the arch, should be considered."

Unlike many other ventral hernias that occur beneath the layer of fat and abdominal skin, Spigelian hernia is situated within the abdominal wall muscles. Spigelian hernia often presents with few symptoms and may exist for a long time without being diagnosed or detected. We report a case of Spigelian hernia causing an intestinal obstruction treated with surgical emergency abdominal wall reconstruction using the sublay technique. Identification and evaluation of cases with the potential for hernia occurrence are crucial for the safety of patients undergoing surgery. Spigelian hernia accounts for 1%-2% of all ventral hernia cases. Currently, there are no reports on Spigelian hernia in Vietnam. However, a few reports on surgical management of Spigelian hernia have been published worldwide, with approaches including laparoscopic and open surgery, and these reports have indicated that abdominal wall reconstruction using the sublay technique is feasible as it is associated with fewer postoperative complications and shorter hospital stays. Here, we describe the case of an 87-year-old woman presenting with swelling and pain in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen. A preoperative diagnosis of Spigelian hernia causing intestinal obstruction was established, and we proceeded with abdominal wall reconstruction using the sublay technique. The patient was discharged three days after surgery without any postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Perforated marginal ulcers (PMUs) are a rare but known complication of bariatric surgery. Management typically involves prompt surgical intervention, but limited data exists on non-operative approaches. This study reviews published data on non-operative management of PMUs and presents a case series of patients who were managed non-operatively. Our hypothesis is that certain patients with signs of perforation can be successfully managed non-operatively with close observation. We completed a systematic review searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov. Ultimately 3 studies described the presentation and non-operative management of 5 patients. Additionally, we prospectively collected data from our institution on all patients who presented between Dec. 2022 and Dec. 2023 with PMUs confirmed on imaging and managed non-operatively. In our literature review, three patients had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), while two had one anastomosis gastric bypass. One patient required surgery two days after admission. Another underwent elective conversion surgery weeks later for a non-healing ulcer. Two received endoscopic interventions. One patient recovered with nil-per-os (NPO) status, and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment. The patients in our case series presented with normal vital signs, an average of 30 months after RYGB, and with CT scan signs of perforation. None of these patients required surgical or endoscopic intervention. In conclusion, while perforated marginal ulcers have traditionally been considered a surgical emergency, some patients can be successfully treated with non-operative management. More research is needed to identify the clinical presentation features, comorbidities, and imaging findings of this group."

Although appendectomy has traditionally been the go-to treatment, recent studies suggest antibiotics can be equally effective for uncomplicated cases. However, evidence is scant regarding patients with hematologic disorders. This study delves into the surgical risks tied to appendicitis in patients with underlying hematologic conditions. A retrospective analysis was carried out on patients diagnosed with appendicitis and hematologic disorders from January 2000 to June 2021. Patients were pinpointed using ICD-10 diagnostic codes, and surgical procedures were identified based on the hospital's surgical fee codes. Hematologic conditions were sorted into risk levels, and patient treatments were scrutinized. Among the 131 initially identified patients, 89 were included in the study. Out of these, 75 underwent surgical procedures, while 14 received non-surgical treatments. The surgical group displayed better preoperative laboratory outcomes. Clinical characteristics, hematologic disease risk, and severity of appendicitis appeared not to be related to surgical complications. Patients without surgical complications showed improvement in preoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet counts. Lower preoperative ANCs and platelet counts were associated with extended hospital stays. For patients with hematologic disorders diagnosed with appendicitis, thorough preoperative laboratory evaluations followed by minimally invasive appendectomy appear to be a safe route without heightening the risk of severe complications compared to non-surgical management."

Records of fifty-two dogs treated in a single hospital service were analyzed. We collected epidemiological data, laboratory results, diagnostic method, anesthetic protocol, surgical technique and time, type of antimicrobial prophylaxis, pre- and intraoperative complications, location and number of parasites, and postoperative survival time. Of the 52 dogs undergoing right nephrectomy by laparotomy, 61.5 % were female and 63.4 % were adults. Although the most common clinical sign was hematuria (25 %), 61.5 % of the patients were asymptomatic. Eosinophilia and increased serum urea were the only laboratory changes found. The interval between diagnosis and surgery was 27.4 ± 23 days and no patient showed changes suggestive of surgical emergency. The most common surgical approach was the right paracostal (61.5 %), and a continuous suture pattern was predominant. Intraoperative complications occurred in 9.6 % of the procedures, varying from mild to severe hemorrhage. Mean postoperative survival was 835.5 ± 428 days. Dioctophymosis was effectively controlled by nephrectomy of the affected kidney, allowing a mean survival of more than 830 days.

The patient was taken to the operating room and a midline laparotomy incision was made. A giant sigmoid diverticulum with ischemic patches was encountered. The cecal appendix was found inside the right inguinal canal, with a perforation in its distal third. A Hartmann's procedure, appendicectomy and non-mesh inguinal hernia repair was accomplished. Case reports of Amyand's hernia in patients with simultaneous abdominal conditions are scarce. Symptoms in these patients could be various and may lead to preoperative imaging and diagnosis. In this case acute abdomen in physical examination demanded imaging analysis and a preoperative diagnosis of acute diverticulitis and Amyand's hernia with a perforated appendicitis was made. Amyand's hernia with acute perforated appendicitis is a rare entity. CT scan is useful for diagnosis of Amyand's hernia and associated conditions. Preoperative diagnosis of Amyand's hernia and concomitant abdominal disease aids in the therapeutic approach and management. To our knowledge this is the first case report of an Amyand's hernia in a patient with acute diverticulitis."

    "abstract": "Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP), also known as abdominal cocoon syndrome, represents a rare cause of small bowel obstruction. Herein we report an uncommon case of small bowel obstruction caused by SEP in a 30-year-old male with no prior surgical history who presented to the emergency department. The patient was diagnosed with SEP on preoperative CT scan and underwent a therapeutic laparotomy with extensive adhesiolysis. His symptoms resolved postoperatively and he was discharged in a good condition. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is more prevalent in men, and has a higher incidence in tropical and subtropical countries. The exact pathophysiology of the disease in not well understood, but subclinical intra-abdominal inflammation is theorized to result in a thick fibrocollagenous membrane encapsulating intra-peritoneal organs which leads to intestinal obstruction. The disease is categorized into primary and secondary SEP depending on identification of a pathologic factor. It is further divided into 3 sub-types according to the extent of the peritoneal membrane encasement observed intra-operatively. Patients often present with recurrent history of small bowel obstruction in the absence of prior abdominal surgery. Computed tomography of the abdomen with experienced radiologist interpretation can aid in preoperative diagnosis. In patients with recurrent obstructions and failure of non-operative management, surgical adhesiolysis remains the gold standard. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis, is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction. The exact pathogenesis is not well understood. The main line of treatment is surgical adhesiolysis and excision of the intra-abdominal fibrocollagenous membrane."

    "title": "Perioperative Adverse Outcome and Its Predictors After Emergency Laparotomy Among Sigmoid Volvulus Patients: Retrospective Follow-Up Study.",
    "abstract": "Acute sigmoid volvulus is a surgical emergency with closed-loop obstruction of the colon that often requires emergency laparotomy, which is associated with a multitude of post-operative complications. Although sigmoid volvulus is the main cause of intestinal obstruction in Ethiopia, local studies of its management outcomes are limited. To assess the magnitude and predictors of adverse perioperative outcomes of emergency laparotomy for acute sigmoid volvulus in the Debre Markos Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (DMCSH), Amhara region, Ethiopia in 2023. This was a retrospective follow-up study. Descriptive statistics were used to measure perioperative outcomes and other study variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of adverse surgical outcomes. Associations were considered significant at p < 0.05 (95% confidence interval). In total, 170 study participants were enrolled, with a response rate of 91.4%. Forty-nine patients (28.8%) developed perioperative adverse outcomes. Pneumonia (29 patients, 28.1%), surgical site infection (19 patients, 18.4%), and wound dehiscence (10 patients, 9.7%) were the most common complications. Pre-operative shock [AOR: 3.87 (95% CI: (1.22, 12.28))], pus or fecal matter contamination of the peritoneum [AOR: 4.43 (95% CI: (1.35, 14.47)], and a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score [AOR: 2.37 (95% CI: (1.05, 5.34))] were identified as predictors of perioperative adverse events. The perioperative adverse outcomes in this study were higher than those reported in Ethiopian national and global reports following emergency laparotomies. Hypotension at presentation, pus and/or fecal matter contamination of the peritoneum, and higher ASA scores are strong predictors of increased perioperative adverse outcomes. Therefore, healthcare providers and institutions involved in the delivery of emergency surgical care should emphasize the importance of early surgical intervention, adequate resuscitation, and patient monitoring to improve perioperative outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen in pregnancy (AAP) is defined as intensive abdominal pain lasting less than 24 hours that may require urgent surgery. It is a challenging situation to diagnose and manage, as it is associated with pain due to the normal anatomical and physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. Therefore, understanding these changes and their effect on almost every system, will help us appreciate the upcoming causes of AAP, mainly the non-obstetric surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis, cholecystitis). This article highlights the importance of the well-rounded care that should be offered to every pregnant patient presenting to any center with a Non-obstetric Acute Abdomen. The causes are discussed separately (for surgical pearls), laparoscopic approach and radiologic modality decision-making in pregnancy, which is an academic and a practice-based helpful summary.

Results and Discussion: In addition, the sequence of ideas and language used in the article was based to help the reader understand the topic, rather than inform them about it. In addition, the utility of laparoscopy in pregnancy remains a concern due to the possible risk of injury to the fetus and fetal acidosis. Although, trials showed that laparoscopy was associated with less blood loss and a shorter hospital stay. Moreover, in some cases radiographic imaging is necessary, posing a diagnostic dilemma. AAP is a major concern that requires early interventions to pinpoint the cause and manage the patient, properly."

    "abstract": "Introduction Acute Appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency. Despite the use of various diagnostic parameters, the rate of negative appendectomy remains high (30%). Thus, through our retrospective study, we aim to analyse whether white blood cell (WBC) count or C-reactive protein (CRP) level is more indicative in the confirmation of AA. We also analysed imaging modalities ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen to find out which is better for diagnosing AA. Methods Patients with suspected AA admitted for laparoscopic appendectomy in Saqr Hospital, Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, during 2019-2020 were included in the study. Patients who had either or both WBC and CRP values were included in the study and their diagnosis was confirmed based on histological appendectomy findings. Data analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and chi-square test as required. p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Out of the 320 patients with suspected AA, WBC had a p-value of 0.8 (insignificant). A total of 228 patients who had elevated WBC had confirmed histological diagnosis of AA, and 152 patients who were tested for CRP and had elevated levels had confirmed histological diagnosis of AA. CRP had a p-value of 0.04 (significant). However, when the ROC curve was used as evidence to see which was a better test, WBC and CRP both had a low area under the curve (AUC), which proved that they were not the most accurate diagnostic marker in diagnosing AA. However, CRP was slightly better than WBC. A total of 266 patients underwent USG abdomen and it had a p-value of 0.4 (insignificant), while 118 patients underwent CT scan, which had a p-value of 0.01 (significant). CT abdomen was statistically proven as a better radiological investigation. Also, when the ROC curve was used to compare USG and CT abdomen, CT again proved to be a better radio diagnostic method for AA. Conclusions From our study, it can be concluded that CRP is better than WBC in ruling in appendicitis and CT abdomen is better than USG in diagnosing appendicitis, but CT abdomen is only next to histological diagnosis in confirming AA. Hence, we recommend doing CRP as the primary laboratory marker for suspected cases of AA. CT abdomen is the ideal imaging modality in cases of suspected AA where clinical examination, laboratory values, and ultrasound examination are inconclusive."

A rare condition called sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP), in which a fibrocollagenous membrane encircles the intestine and other abdominal organs, surprised us in a case of an acute abdomen. Persistent descending mesocolon is another unusual condition in which the descending colon is transferred downward and to the right abdominal region because its mesocolon is unable to merge with the posterior abdominal wall. Those two different conditions are extremely rare and were never been described in a single case.

    "abstract": "Spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SSAH) is a rare condition that can cause spinal cord or nerve root compression and permanent neurologic damage. The reported etiologies include trauma, vascular malformations or aneurysms, coagulopathies, neoplasms, autoimmune disease, and spontaneous hemorrhage. If there is evidence of neurologic deterioration, it is commonly managed as a surgical emergency, but cases of conservative management have also been reported. In this case series, we present three patients who suffered from SSAH. The first was a spontaneous cervical SSAH that occurred following cardiac catheterization, the second was a spontaneous thoracolumbar SSAH in a patient with a known history of coagulopathy, and the third was a thoracolumbar SSAH that was caused by a dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF). All three patients exhibited neurologic deficits and thus underwent emergent decompression and hematoma evacuation. The patient with the dAVF also required open ligation of the fistula. Following surgical intervention, all three patients regained at least partial neurologic function, but one patient developed symptomatic arachnoid cysts that required further intervention. The presented case series highlights the importance and time-sensitivity of surgical decompression in patients experiencing neurologic deficits from SSAH. These cases underscore the urgency of timely neurosurgical intervention to mitigate neurologic impairment and add insights to the existing literature on this rare condition."

Despite a stable initial condition and discharge, he returned the following day with dizziness and severe anemia. Subsequent diagnostics revealed a ruptured spleen, necessitating immediate surgical intervention. This case emphasizes traumatic and atraumatic causes of splenic rupture, with older adults, anticoagulant users, and viral illnesses accentuating vulnerability. Physical exam findings might be absent, highlighting the importance of considering splenic rupture in cases of unexplained hemodynamic instability. In this instance, a combination of trauma, a possible history of anticoagulation use, and a recent viral illness contributed to the patient's splenic rupture. The case underscores the need to retain a high index of suspicion for splenic rupture even without obvious physical findings, advocating for diligent evaluation of abnormal vital signs."

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, almost every type of abdominal surgery has been performed and refined using the laparoscopic technique. Surgeons are applying it for more procedures, which not so long ago were performed only in the classical way. The position of laparoscopic surgery is therefore well established, and in many operations it is currently the recommended and dominant method. The aim of the preparation of these guidelines was to concisely summarize the current knowledge on laparoscopy in acute abdominal diseases for the purposes of the continuous training of surgeons and to create a reference for opinions. The development of these recommendations is based on a review of the available literature from the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases from 1985 to 2022, with particular emphasis on systematic reviews and clinical recommendations of recognized scientific societies. The recommendations were formulated in a directive form and evaluated by a group of experts using the Delphi method. There are 63 recommendations divided into 12 sections: diagnostic laparoscopy, perforated ulcer, acute pancreatitis, incarcerated hernia, acute cholecystitis, acute appendicitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, laparoscopy in pregnancy, and postoperative complications requiring emergency surgery. Each recommendation was supported by scientific evidence and supplemented with expert comments. The guidelines were created on the initiative of the Videosurgery Chapter of the Association of Polish Surgeons and are recommended by the national consultant in the field of general surgery. The second part of the guidelines covers sections 6 to12 and the following challenges for surgical practice: acute appendicitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, abdominal injuries, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, laparoscopy in pregnancy and postoperative complications requiring a reoperation."

    "title": "Glucose indices as inflammatory markers in children with acute surgical abdomen: a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Glycaemic dysregulation potentiates the pro-inflammatory response and increases oxidative injury; therefore, preoperative hyperglycaemia is linked to increased mortalities. In addition, inflammation is accompanied by higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and the relationship between this and random blood sugar (RBS) could be non-linear. This is a cross-sectional study. Non-diabetic paediatric patients with acute surgical abdomen, presenting to the emergency surgical services were enrolled, over a period of 6 months. They were all screened for their random blood sugar and HbA1c levels. Fifty-three cases were studied. The prevalence of glycaemic dysregulation in the enrolled children was high. Abnormal HbA1c was observed in 66% of the study group. Stress hyperglycaemia was observed in 60% of the enrolled children. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.770, p-value: < 0.001) between RBS and the total leucocytic count (TLC). The TLC cutoff value for predicting stress hyperglycaemia was 13,595 cells/mm3. The cutoff value of RBS for predicting leukocytosis was 111.5 mg/dl. Median RBS level was significantly higher in complicated appendicitis (169.5 mg/dl), compared to uncomplicated appendicitis (118.0 mg/dl). HbA1c and RBS could be used as inflammatory markers for surgical acute abdomen and its degree of severity, respectively. HbA1c rises in a considerable number of cases with surgical acute abdomen, irrespective of the disease stage. However, as the disease progresses, the random blood sugar rises due to stress hyperglycaemia, thus becoming a surrogate inflammatory marker. What is already known on this topic? Preoperative stress hyperglycaemia is common in children, and it is linked to adverse postoperative outcomes. HbA1c could be a marker for inflammation and oxidative stress.What does this study add? HbA1c could be an inflammatory marker for surgical acute abdomen, irrespective of the disease stage, as it had a high prevalence in the enrolled children with an acute surgical abdomen. However, as the disease progresses, the random blood sugar rises due to stress hyperglycaemia, thus becoming a surrogate inflammatory marker, as there is a significant correlation between it and the TLC.How might this study affect research, practice, or policy? The novelty in this study centers around the role of glucose metabolism, as evaluated by random blood sugar and HBA1c, in the diagnostic evaluation and prognostication of inflammation, represented by the surgical acute abdomen. This may invite further research into understanding the underlining mechanisms. The outcome of the clinical management of conditions involving inflammation can be improved by using the proposed biomarkers, as peri/preoperative hyperglycaemia could lead to morbidity and mortality, consequently, as proven, the reliability of those biomarkers facilitates risk assessment and stratification. As both tests are cost-effective and universally available, they can be readily implemented in practice guidelines and departmental policies."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a common occurrence in the United States, with the majority passing asymptomatically. In cases where complications occur, such as intestinal perforation, it may present as an acute abdomen with diagnostic challenges regarding the etiology. A 70-year-old male was brought to the emergency department (ED) after he jumped from the second floor of a burning building, sustaining 10% second-degree burns to his forearms. He was intubated for concerns of inhalational injury and resuscitated. His intensive care unit (ICU) course included the management of respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. On hospital day 28, imaging showed moderate pneumoperitoneum with ascites. He was taken for abdominal exploration, during which it was noted that there was gross fecal contamination and a 1 cm cecal perforation. After resection of the ileocecum, it was left in discontinuity due to hemodynamic instability and contamination. He was brought for a second-look laparotomy in 48 hours, and an incisor tooth was found in the right pelvis, and an ileocolic (ileum-ascending colon) anastomosis was performed. His post-operative course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and an intra-abdominal collection. Despite attempts at source control with percutaneous drainage, the patient remained septic with a poor prognosis. Goals of care were discussed, and the decision was made to de-escalate care. Although there is literature on foreign body ingestion resulting in intestinal perforation, there is a paucity of literature highlighting the importance of dental exams in elderly trauma patients, the incidence of perforation due to tooth ingestion, and maintaining a high index of suspicion for an acute abdomen in unusual presentations of sepsis."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common general surgical emergency worldwide; however, its diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in rural or remote areas such as Tibet. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and applicability of the routine risk prediction models of acute appendicitis for rural Tibetan populations. Data of patients who underwent appendectomy at the Chaya People's Hospital between 1 April 2018 and 30 September 2021 were retrospectively collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with complicated appendicitis. The appendicitis risk prediction model scores for each patient were calculated by the binary logistic regression model based on the data. The index of union method was applied to identify the optimal cut-off value for the critical values of risk prediction models. We included 127 patients with suspected acute appendicitis in the study, consisting of 96 surgically and 31 non-surgically treated. The diagnoses of 93 patients who underwent appendectomy included 55 (59.1%) cases of uncomplicated appendicitis. Patients with complicated appendicitis had a significantly longer postoperative hospital stay (11.0 (interquartile range 8.8-13.3) days v 8.0 (interquartile range 6.0-11.0) days; p<0.001) and higher hospital costs (US$2147.2 (interquartile range US$1625.1-2516.6) v US$1487.9 (interquartile range US$1202.6-1809.2); p24 hours, age >30 years, and male sex were independent risk factors associated with complicated appendicitis. The appendicitis inflammatory response score showed the best performance among the prediction models. Incorporating imaging features in the prediction models may provide better diagnostic value for appendicitis. Acute appendicitis in the rural Tibetan population has unique clinical features. To reduce the incidence of complicated appendicitis, local health workers must balance religious beliefs and professional services for residents."

    "abstract": "A volvulus is a serious surgical emergency caused by torsion or hyper-flexion of the bowel loop and its mesentery on a fixed point. Cecal volvulus is an uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction, accounting for just 1-1.5 % of all cases of bowel obstruction. A 33-year-old intellectually disabled male presented to the emergency department with complaints of generalized abdominal pain, absolute constipation, and non-projectile vomiting. He had a grossly distended and rigid abdomen with generalized tenderness and guarding. The abdomen was hyper-resonant. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. Digital rectal examination revealed an empty and collapsed rectum with no stool staining of the finger. Laboratory reports showed leukocytosis and neutrophilia. Radiographic imaging was consistent with acute intestinal obstruction. Laparotomy was performed, and cecal volvulus with viable bowel and acute appendicitis was diagnosed intra-operatively. Manual detorsion, cecopexy, and appendectomy were performed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. The patient is still on follow-up since June 2023, and no complication has occurred. Cecal volvulus is an uncommon cause of intestinal obstruction with multiple etiologies. The annual incidence of cecal volvulus is estimated to be between 2.8 and 7.1 cases per million. Cecal volvulus may lead to life-threatening complications such as bowel ischemia and perforation. Diagnosis of cecal volvulus must be made promptly to prevent bowel gangrene and perforation. In this case, manual detorsion and cecopexy were performed as the bowel was viable per-operatively due to early surgical intervention."

We present the case of an 87-year-old woman with acute abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant that began two days prior with no additional symptoms. The physical examination showed a large abdominal eventration on the right side and tenderness. A CT scan showed a distended gallbladder outside its liver bed and with a twist on its cystic pedicle, suggesting a gallbladder volvulus. Abdominal ultrasonography complementary revealed the gallbladder outside its vesicular fossa with incipient changes of acute cholecystitis but without evidence of gallstones. With the diagnosis of acute abdomen secondary to gallbladder volvulus, an emergency cholecystectomy was performed. The exact etiology of the gallbladder volvulus is unknown, although anatomical variants that predispose to its appearance have been described. The clinical presentation is similar to acute cholecystitis, so preoperative diagnosis can be challenging for both surgeons and radiologists and is often misdiagnosed. This is one of the few cases diagnosed with preoperative imaging techniques. Once diagnosed, the appropriate treatment is emergency cholecystectomy. Early diagnosis and surgical treatment are important before it progresses to necrosis, perforation, biliary peritonitis, and hemodynamic instability. Gallbladder volvulus is an uncommon condition. A high index of suspicion is required because the preoperative diagnosis is unusual. Once the diagnosis is established, the treatment is fundamentally surgical."

This article presents a particularly uncommon case of a right diaphragmatic hernia resulting from a neglected defect following the resection of a diaphragmatic lymphangioma and sheds light on the pitfalls that may lead to such a post-operative event. Our surgical ward admitted a 36-year-old patient presenting symptoms indicative of bowel obstruction. Four months earlier, the patient had undergone laparoscopic resection of a lymphangioma located in the right dome of the diaphragm. Thoracic auscultation yielded hyperactive bowel sounds at the lower lung field and the right costophrenic angle. Abdominal distention was observed without any signs of peritoneal irritation. A thoracic and abdominal CT scan provided confirmation of a right diaphragmatic hernia. Subsequently, an immediate laparotomy was performed. The right colic hepatic flexure was released, and the diaphragmatic breach was sutured. The postoperative course was uneventful. Iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia remains a possible complication of this surgery. It could occur even on the right side where the liver has a cushioning effect. Incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia is a surgical emergency that should be operated on as quickly as possible. A systematic check of the diaphragm's integrity at the end of the surgical procedure could prevent such complications. While surgical techniques and laparoscopic instrumentation have witnessed significant advancements in recent years, achieving proficiency and the precise execution of surgical techniques remain of utmost importance."

    "abstract": "Cirrhosis of the upper GIB is a surgical emergency, PN and CN can reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but there is a lack of analysis on PN combined with CN in Cirrhotic patients. This work explored the effects of psychological nursing (PN) combined with comprehensive nursing (CN) on gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and nutritional status of patients with cirrhosis. Total 80 patients with GIB and cirrhosis who received emergency treatment in the Affiliated Hospital of Shaoxing University from October 2019 to October 2022 were randomly rolled into two groups. Patients in the control group (Ctrl group) received CN (n = 40 cases), and those in the experimental group (Exp group) received PN combined CN (n = 40 cases). The Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), SCL-90, complication rate, and nursing satisfaction of patients from different groups were analyzed and compared. MELD score effectively predicts short - and medium-term mortality in end-stage liver disease. SAS consisted of 20 questions related to anxiety symptoms, four-level scoring method was adopted. The SCL-90 scale included four aspects: somatic symptoms, interpersonal relationships, psychological emotions, and psychological needs. The results disclosed that after nursing intervention, SAS, SDS, and MELD scores in the Exp group were remarkably lower than those in the Ctrl group (P < .05). The scores of SCL-90 somatic symptoms, interpersonal relationships, psychological emotion, and psychological needs of participants in the Exp group were much lower than those in the Ctrl group (P < .05). The complication rate was significantly lower in the Exp (30.0%) than in the Ctrl groups (72.5%) (P < .05). The total nursing satisfaction was increased, and it is significan higher in the Exp group (97.5%) than control group (87.5% ) (P < .05). In conclusion, PN combined with CN could effectively reduce the incidence of complications in patients with GIB and cirrhosis and improve nursing satisfaction. Therefore, such a method was worth promoting, which provides a reference for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with GIB and cirrhosis."

    "abstract": "We describe the case of a 69-year-old female who thought she had \"food poisoning\", which prompted her visit to the Emergency Department for evaluation of her vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Contrasted computed tomography imaging with contrast of the abdomen subsequently revealed the diagnosis of gastric volvulus, and the patient was promptly taken for surgical intervention. Gastric volvulus is rare and presents with a nonspecific history, exam, and laboratory findings. In the acute care setting, it is important to maintain a high clinical suspicion for this diagnosis, as timely imaging and intervention are crucial to decreasing patient morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency that can occur in any part of the body and can cause cell necrosis when maintained over time. The resulting defects can affect the nerves, muscle cells, bone tissue, and other connective tissues inside the compartment, and fasciotomy has to be performed. The anatomical and histological characteristics of the leg make acute, chronic, and exertional compartment syndrome more likely in this limb. For these reasons, knowledge of the ultrasound, anatomical, and histological features of the crural fascia can help in the treatment of leg compartment syndrome. Twenty-one cryopreserved lower limbs from adult cadavers and from one 29-week-old fetus were obtained from the dissection room. They were examined by ultrasound and a subsequent anatomical dissection and microscopy to study the crural fascia and its relationship with the different muscles. Anthropometric measurements were taken of the distances from the head of the fibula and lateral malleolus to the origin of the tibialis anterior muscle in the crural fascia, the exit of the superficial fibular nerve, and the fascia covering the deep posterior muscles of the leg. The crural fascia has very important clinical relationships, which can be identified by ultrasound, as the origin of the tibialis anterior muscle at 16.25 cm from the head of the fibula and the exit of the superficial fibular nerve that crosses this fascia at 21.25 cm from the head of the fibula. Furthermore, the presence of a septum that fixes the deep posterior muscles of the leg and the vessels and nerve can be seen by ultrasound and can explain the possible development of a posterior compartmental syndrome of the leg. Awareness of these features will help to keep these structures safe during the surgical treatment of compartment syndrome. The ultrasound study allows identification of anatomical structures in the leg and, thus, avoids damage to them during surgery for compartmental syndromes."

    "abstract": "Background Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency worldwide. Delay in diagnosis of disease often leads to serious complications such as perforation appendicitis (PA) and gangrenous appendicitis (GA). Aims and objectives The purpose of the study is to document clinicopathological outcomes in pediatric age group patients in a tertiary health care center. Material and method This study was a prospective observation study of 50 patients with pediatric appendicitis who had undergone emergency appendectomy from January 2022 to December 2022. All pediatric patients below 15 years of age with a diagnosis of AA were included. Institute ethical permission was granted before the study, and parent consent was taken for the surgery and also for inclusion in the study. After proper resuscitation, all patients underwent appendectomy, and necessary specimens were sent for histological examination. Based on histopathology reports, all patients were classified into four groups: AA, PA, GA, and normal appendix (NA). Results Out of 50 patients, 33 (66%) patients were males and 17 (34%) patients were females. The mean age of the patients was 10.22 ± 2.73 years. The mean age of AA, PA, GA, and NA patients were 10.25 ± 2.6 years, 9.78 ± 2.99 years, 10.00 ± 4.6 years, and 12.00 ± 2.8 years, respectively. The mean duration of symptoms at the time of hospital admission was 2.42 ± 0.97 days for histopathologically proven AA patients, 4.67 ± 2.1 days for GA patients, 2.8 ± 0.83 for PA patients, and one day for NA patients. Overall clinical presentation was right iliac fossa (RIF) pain in 36 (72%) patients, migration of pain in 31 (62%) patients, anorexia in 37 (74%) patients, nausea and vomiting in 43 (86%) patients fever in 26 (52%) patients, RIF tenderness in 50 (100%) patients, rebound tenderness in 39 (78%) patients, guarding in 19 (38%) patients, Psoas's sign in nine (18% patients), and Rovsing's sign in 19 (38%) patients. On histopathological examination of the sent specimen, AA was found in 36 (72%) patients, PA was found in nine (18%) patients, GA was found in three (6%) patients, and NA was found in two (4%) patients. Wound infection was the most common complication and was found in five (10%) patients. The average duration of hospital stay for AA, PA, GA, and NA was 4.33 ± 1.04 days, 9.56 ± 4.2 days, 12.33 ± 8.5 days, and 3.50 ± 0.71 days, respectively. Conclusion The appendicular disease is common in teenage male children. Fever, dehydration, and rebound tenderness at the RIF are clinically significant findings. Duration of symptoms at the time of diagnosis, post-appendectomy complication, and duration of hospital stay significantly correlated with histopathological findings."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer stands as a prevalent cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating effective treatment strategies. Acute colonic obstruction occurs in approximately 20% of patients and represents a surgical emergency with substantial morbidity and mortality. The optimal approach for managing left-sided colon cancer with acute colonic obstruction remains debatable, with no consensus on whether emergency resection or bridge-to-surgery, involving initial decompressing stoma and subsequent elective resection after recovery, should be employed. Current studies show a decrease in morbidity and short-term mortality for the bridge-to-surgery approach, yet it remains unclear if the long-term oncological outcome is equivalent to emergency resection. This prospective, randomized, multicenter trial aims to investigate the management of obstructive left-sided colon cancer in a comprehensive manner. The study will be conducted across 26 university hospitals and 40 academic hospitals in Germany. A total of 468 patients will be enrolled, providing a cohort of 420 evaluable patients, with an equal distribution of 210 patients in each treatment arm. Patients with left-sided colon cancer, defined as cancer between the left splenic flexure and > 12 cm ab ano and obstruction confirmed by X-ray or CT scan, are eligible. Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio, assigning patients either to the oncological emergency resection group or the bridge-to-surgery group, wherein patients will undergo diverting stoma and subsequent elective oncological resection after recovery. The primary endpoint of this trial will be 120-day mortality, allowing for consideration of the time interval between diverting stoma and resection. The findings derived from this trial possess the potential to reshape the current clinical approach of emergency resection for obstructive left-sided colon cancer by favoring the bridge-to-surgery practice, provided that a reduction in morbidity can be achieved without compromising the oncological long-term outcome.

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen (WS) is a rare condition, occurring in only 0.2 % of cases, where the spleen becomes hypermobile due to the absence or laxity of its anchoring ligaments. Torsion of the spleen, primarily seen in children but occasionally in adults, is a critical complication that can lead to infarction and is considered a medical emergency. We present a case report of a 50-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes and psychiatric illness presented with 2 days of vomiting, abdominal pain, and dehydration. Physical examination showed a tender mass in the abdomen and imaging confirmed a twisted spleen with a thrombosed splenic vein, leading to a successful emergency splenectomy. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged with post-splenectomy protocol. Splenic torsion, a rare occurrence primarily observed in children. Clinical diagnosis is aided by palpable abdominal masses and confirmed by radiological imaging. The gold standard diagnostic tool is contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), whereas Ultrasonography (USG) is equally good in early assessment. Early identification is crucial to salvage the spleen. Management options include detorsion, splenopexy, or splenectomy depending on the organ viability. Elective splenopexy has emerged as a proactive measure, particularly in children, to prevent complications. Splenic torsion is a rare but important differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute abdomen. Early diagnosis and prompt management is necessary to preserve the spleen and to prevent the development of complication. Surgery is often necessary and either splenopexy or splenectomy should be done."

CT showed a pelvic mass of 19.5×9.4×10.2 cm in size, containing a haemorrhagic component. It was assumed that the tumour was the previously diagnosed myoma, and that it had increased to 150% of the size noted 3 years ago. An emergent hysterectomy was performed, and the pathological diagnosis was a uterine leiomyoma, with no components suggestive of sarcoma or degeneration. We witnessed a rare case of acute abdomen caused by internodular bleeding of multiple myomas. We assumed that the source of bleeding was the vessels of the myoma pseudocapsule. These cases may be more likely to occur in patients with multiple myomas presenting around the commencement of menopause. For symptomatic relief, emergent hysterectomy is considered to be the best treatment."

    "title": "Comparison of Pediatric Acute Appendicitis Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York City.",
    "abstract": "Background: Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in children and adolescents. In the year immediately following the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), there was a precipitous decline in emergency department (ED) visits especially for surgical conditions and infectious diseases. Fear of exposure to severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 infection resulted in delay in presentation and time to surgery, and a shift toward more conservative management. Objective: Our goal was to compare the incidence and severity of AA before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients aged 2-18 years admitted with the diagnosis of AA to Flushing Hospital Medical Center or Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens, New York, were selected for chart review. Data extracted from electronic health records included demographics, clinical findings, imaging studies, and operative and pathological findings. We calculated the Alvarado score (AS) for incidence and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade for severity. We compared patients admitted between March 1, 2018-February 29, 2020 (pre-pandemic) to patients admitted between March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021 (pandemic). We then compared pre-pandemic and pandemic groups to determine differences in pediatric AA incidence and severity. Results: Of 239 patients diagnosed with AA, 184 (77%) were in the pre-pandemic group and 55 (23%) in the pandemic group. Incidence (number per year) of AA declined by 40%. The pandemic group had significantly greater overall AS of ≥7, indicating increased likelihood to require surgery, (P = 0.04) and higher AAST grade demonstrating increased severity (P = 0.02). Conclusion: There was a decline in the number of AA cases seen in our pediatric EDs and admitted during the first year of the pandemic. Clinicians need to be aware of increased severity of AA at time of presentation during public health emergencies such as a pandemic, possibly due to modified patient behavior."

CV is a surgical emergency that must be treated immediately because the mortality rate can reach 30 %, and the recurrence rate is 40 %. This study showed a case illustration of caecal volvulus with evidence-based recommendations for indications and management of caecopexy based on postoperative outcomes. 33-Year-old male came with chief complaints of persistent acute abdominal pain one day before hospital admission. Pain is felt suddenly throughout the abdomen. On physical examination, palpable pain in the entire abdomen is obtained, accompanied by the muscular defence with increased bowel sounds. The laboratory only showed increased white blood cells. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast showed closed-loop obstruction (CLO) signs. Caecopexy technique use is supported in a case series because it can be done safely, quickly, and without the need to open intestinal segments. Based on previous researches, there were none to low rate of morbidity, mortality, and recurrence. In this patient, caecopexy was carried out and showed good output with no complications. Caecopexy is a safe, simple, and less invasive procedure. The advantages of the caecopexy technique are low morbidity, mortality, and recurrence. The patient's outcome in this illustration is consistent with other literature. Thus it can be used as evidence-based recommendations in the management of the next case of caecal volvulus."

The goal of this research was to identify the factors influencing healing in perforated and non-perforated appendectomy procedures. This descriptive research involved 75 children who underwent appendectomy. Information was collected during the preoperative and postoperative stages using a data collection form and a pain assessment scale. Both parents and children hospitalized with appendicitis contributed to this information. The primary complaints leading children to the hospital were nausea and vomiting, which started, on average, 2.7 days prior to admission. While 96% of the children underwent open surgery, 77.3% presented with non-perforated appendicitis. Feeding was ceased 9 hours pre-operation and recommenced in the 15th postoperative hour. A significant difference was noted between perforation status and discharge time. Factors influencing healing included the length of hospital stay, perforation status, preoperative information, time of postoperative oral feeding initiation, and intravenous fluid therapy. The study suggests that early feeding, mobilization, and patient counseling can reduce pain and expedite recovery and discharge."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency worldwide. Recent studies on hematological inflammatory markers concerning acute appendicitis have shown variable results. The aim of this study was to evaluate pre-operative values of platelet indices such as mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW), and red cell distribution width (RDW) in relation to the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and their efficacy as predictors of appendicular perforation. A prospective observational study of 190 patients diagnosed with appendicitis and who underwent an appendectomy was undertaken and confirmed histopathologically. Preoperatively, blood samples of white blood cells (WBCs), platelet count, MPV, PDW, and RDW were analyzed using a Sysmex XN1000 analyzer machine. Of 190 patients, 169 had acute appendicitis, and 21 had perforated appendicitis. The mean age of patients was 28.04 ± 14.2 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. The WBC (p<0.05), MPV (p<0.05), and PDW (p<0.05) were found to have higher statistically significant values in acute appendicitis and perforated appendicitis compared to the RDW (p>0.05). However, perforated appendicitis had a higher RDW value compared to acute appendicitis, which can be a predictive factor. The elevated value of MPV and PDW associated with leukocytosis can be used as supportive evidence for the clinical and radiological diagnosis of acute appendicitis and appendicular perforation. Thus, these values can be used as diagnostic cost-effective inflammatory biomarkers. A apendicite aguda é uma emergência cirúrgica comum em todo o mundo. Estudos recentes sobre marcadores inflamatórios hematológicos relacionados à apendicite aguda mostraram resultados variáveis. Avaliar valores pré-operatórios de índices plaquetários como volume médio de plaquetas (VPM) e largura de distribuição de plaquetas (PDW), largura de distribuição de hemácias (RDW) em relação ao diagnóstico de apendicite aguda e sua eficácia como preditores de apendicite perfuração. Estudo observacional prospectivo de 190 pacientes diagnosticados com apendicite e submetidos a apendicectomia confirmados histopatologicamente. Amostras de sangue pré-operatórias de glóbulos brancos (WBC), contagem de plaquetas, volume plaquetário médio (MPV), distribuição das plaquetas (PDW) e distribuição dos glóbulos vermelhos (RDW) foram analisadas usando uma máquina analisadora Sysmex XN1000. Foram incluídos 190 pacientes, sendo que 169 tiveram apendicite aguda e 21 tiveram apendicite perfurada. A média de idade dos pacientes foi de 28,04 ± 14,2. A proporção homem-mulher foi de 1,5:1. Verificou-se que WBC (p<0,05), MPV (p<0,05) e PDW (p<;0,05) têm valores estatisticamente significativos mais altos na apendicite aguda e na apendicite perfurada em comparação com o RDW (p> 0,05). No entanto, a apendicite perfurada apresentou um valor de RDW maior em comparação com a apendicite aguda, o que pode ser um fator preditivo. O valor elevado de MPV e PDW associado à leucocitose pode ser usado como evidência de suporte para o diagnóstico clínico e radiológico de apendicite aguda e perfuração apendicular. Assim, esses valors podem ser usado como biomarcadores inflamatórios diagnósticos de baixo custo."

We aimed to analyze and report the early and midterm outcomes of surgeon-modified fenestrated stent-grafts (SMFSG) compared with other conventional endovascular methods in patients with BTAI repaired with zone 2 endovascular surgery. Before and after the study was performed, from January 2015 to January 2020 for a period in which conventional endovascular treatments were used and from January 2020 to January 2023 for the second period in which the SMFSG technique was used. A total of 25 patients who underwent zone 2 endovascular repair for BTAI were included. The patients treated with conventional endovascular methods in the first period, chimney thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) (n=3 patients); Left subclavian artery (LSA)-covered (intentionally total) (n=12 patients) LSA-covered (LSAC) TEVAR; carotid-subclavian bypass TEVAR (n=2 patients) was defined as group 1, and the group of patients treated with SMFSG in the second period was defined as group 2. The primary endpoints of the study were technical success, defined as complete closure of BTAI, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were aortic pathology-related morbidity, mortality, and re-interventions during the follow-up period. The mean age was 42.6±14.3 years, and 21 (84%) of the patients were male. The patients were compared with respect to the proximal landing zone, fluoroscopy time, duration of the procedure, length of intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay, no statistically significant difference was found between the 2 groups (p>0.05). The mean follow-up time of patients in group I was 46±9 months, while in group II, it was 14±6 months (p<0.001). While no TEVAR-related complications were detected in group II throughout follow-up, they occurred in 4 patients (28.6%) in group I. TEVAR is the most appropriate treatment for BTAI in the modern era, especially for polytrauma patients with successful outcomes. Intentional coverage of the LSA can be performed, but SMFSG is an effective, economical, rapid, and available technique for endovascular revascularization of the LSA.Clinical ImpactAltough intentional left subclavian artery coverage is preferred routinely in patients with blunt traumatic aortic injury (in Zone 2) which is a highly fatal surgical emergency, surgeon-modified fenestrated stent-grafts is also effective, economical, rapid and available technique."

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen manifests when the splenic ligaments are underdeveloped, or become lax, thereby allowing the spleen to relocate from its anatomical site to more distant areas. During such movements, torsion of the long splenic peduncle is common, which can lead to symptoms of acute abdomen and further complications such as infarction. It is typically seen in children and young females. Our report presents a case of a 22-year-old female presenting to the ER with complaints of severe pain in the abdominal region. On ultrasound, there was suspicion of an adnexal mass, which was later confirmed to be a misplaced spleen in the lower abdomen, with torsion, fat stranding, and splenic vein thrombosis, as revealed by enhanced CT abdomen and pelvic MRI. It was followed by an emergency splenectomy. As wandering spleen presents nonspecifically and is a rare condition, it is important to consider wandering spleen when patients present similarly to this case, to prevent misdiagnosis and to deliver surgical treatment quickly to preserve the spleen."

    "abstract": "Adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) represents a common surgical emergency leading to increased hospital admissions. Most patients presenting with adhesive SBO have a history of previous abdominal surgery. Although bowel obstruction secondary to congenital adhesion bands is rare, it should not be ruled out even in patients with a \"virgin abdomen\". We present two rare cases of adult patients with SBO due to congenital adhesions. The first patient was transferred to the operating room, secondary to a closed-loop obstruction diagnosis. Two congenital adhesion bands were detected intraoperatively, then coagulated and divided. The second patient was surgically treated due to worsening abdominal pain. An adhesive band was identified occluding the ileum on surgical exploration, then ligated and excised. Both patients recovered uneventfully, without any recurrence of symptoms on the follow-up. Single adhesive bands are more commonly found in cases with a \"virgin abdomen\". Meanwhile, solitary bands usually lead to bowel strangulation and ischemia, mostly mandating operative management. Interestingly, a computed tomography scan may confirm the diagnosis of bowel obstruction, whereas water-soluble contrast agents may help predict the need for surgical treatment. Besides exploratory laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery is gaining ground as an effective SBO diagnosis and management approach. Adhesive SBO due to congenital bands is a rare condition, particularly in adults, with potentially lifethreatening complications. With the aim of prompt diagnosis and treatment, a high index of suspicion and awareness should be maintained even in patients without previous medical or surgical history. Small bowel obstruction, Congenital adhesion bands, Virgin abdomen. L’ostruzione aderenziale dell’intestino tenue (SBO) rappresenta un’emergenza chirurgica comune che comporta ricoveri ospedalieri in aumento La maggior parte dei pazienti che presentano SBO aderenziale ha nella storia un precedente intervento chirurgico addominale. Sebbene l’ostruzione intestinale secondaria a briglie aderenziali congenite sia rara, non dovrebbe essere esclusa nemmeno nei pazienti con “addome vergine”. Presentiamo due rari casi di pazienti adulti con SBO dovuta ad aderenze congenite. Il primo paziente è stato trasferito in sala operatoria, in seguito a una diagnosi di ostruzione ad ansa chiusa. Due briglie aderenziali congenite sono state riconosciute all’intervento, e quindi coagulate e sezionate. Il secondo paziente è stato sottoposto a laparotomia esplorativa per un peggioramento del dolore addominale. All’esplorazione chirurgica è stata identificata una briglia adesiva che occludeva l’ileo, che è stata legata e asportata. Entrambi i pazienti si sono ripresi senza problemi, senza alcuna recidiva dei sintomi al follow-up. Nei con un “addome vergine” si trovano più comunemente singole briglie aderenziali. Queste di solito comportano per lo più uno strangolamento intestinale e a fenomeni ischemici, che richiedono un trattamento chirurgico. È interessante notare che una tomografia computerizzata può confermare la diagnosi di ostruzione intestinale, mentre i mezzi di contrasto idrosolubili possono aiutare a prevedere la necessità di un trattamento chirurgico. Oltre alla laparotomia esplorativa, la chirurgia laparoscopica sta guadagnando terreno come efficace approccio diagnostico e gestionale dell’SBO. SBO adesivo per briglie aderenziali congenite è una condizione rara, in particolare negli adulti, con complicazioni potenzialmente pericolose per la vita. Al fine di conseguire diagnosi e trattamento tempestivi, dovrebbe essere considerato un alto indice di sospetto, nella consapevolezza di tale evenienza. anche nei pazienti senza precedenti medici o chirurgici a livello addominale."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (PD) is considered a serious, alarming symptom since they are at increased risk for exogenous infection introduced through the peritoneal catheter. Differential diagnosis includes perforated peptic ulcer, cholecystitis, ischemic colitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, ingestion of foreign body, or malignancy. Typical features of perforation include signs of acute abdomen in addition to free air under the diaphragm detected on imaging. Perforation is an indication of emergency laparotomy, which is the gold standard for diagnosis. We reported a case of a 23-year-old Palestinian male patient who had recently started continuous ambulatory PD. He presented with generalized, colicky abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. He noticed turbid peritoneal fluid while performing daily dialysis sessions. The patient was diagnosed with PD-related peritonitis but had no improvement on intraperitoneal antibiotics. Further evaluation revealed an intraabdominal cause, a perforated appendix. He underwent an urgent laparotomy and switched to hemodialysis. The patient expired due to the complications of his disease. Although PD-related peritonitis is readily diagnosed in patients on continuous ambulatory PD, an underlying intraabdominal pathology should be suspected when the condition is resistant to conventional treatment. Accepting or refuting such a diagnosis can be challenging."

    "abstract": "Intussusception is typically considered an acute emergency; however, the increased utilisation of medical imaging has revealed that intussusceptions can also be transient, asymptomatic and possibly physiologic. Sonographers should be aware of three categories of intussusceptions: (i) persistent intussusceptions resulting in acute abdomen and requiring urgent intervention, (ii) transient symptomatic intussusceptions which may be amenable to a 'wait-and-see' strategy and (iii) transient asymptomatic intussusceptions which almost always involve the small bowel. In particular, the incidental discovery of enteroenteric intussusceptions in children should not be confused with acute pathology. In adults, sonographers should be mindful of the frequent presence of pathological lead points and further investigations may be warranted. In this literature review, we provide an overview of transient intussusceptions, highlight important differences between children and adults and describe sonographic appearances of various intussusceptions and their mimics."

Acute abdomen and peritonitis is a rare complication in a previously healthy woman following a seemingly uncomplicated normal full-term vaginal delivery. We report such a case in a 20-year-old gravida 2 para 2 (G2P2) woman of Guatemalan descent, who presented nine days postpartum following an uncomplicated delivery, to the emergency room with acute abdomen and associated systemic inflammatory reaction. Interventional radiology paracentesis was performed, yielding a milky, purulent peritoneal fluid with no visible organisms and negative cultures. Antibiotics and paracentesis were insufficient in managing her condition, which continued to worsen over the course of several days. Given her continued deterioration despite clinical intervention, she underwent an exploratory laparotomy and peritoneal lavage along with continued broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cultures continued to be negative but operative findings included diffuse fibrinous peritonitis with no obvious abscess or perforated abdominal viscus. Following surgical laparotomy, she recovered fully without any complications. We review the available literature regarding peritonitis, discuss its management, and speculate as to its cause in this case."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous gallbladder perforation is a rare complication of gallstone disease. It causes acute peritonitis with potentially fatal outcome. We present a case of spontaneous gallbladder perforation with challenging diagnosis. The diagnosis of gallbladder perforation should be considered in elderly patients presenting to the surgical emergency department with symptoms and signs of peritonitis even in the absence of pre-existing gallbladder disease. Spontaneous gallbladder perforation is a rare and potentially fatal diagnosis. In most reported cases, perforation occurred due to predisposing factors like acute cholecystitis, trauma or obstruction. In spite of rarity, spontaneous gallbladder perforation should be considered as differential diagnosis on examination of patients with sudden abdominal pain especially in cases of known cholecystolithiasis. Our patient had type 1 perforation according to Niemeier classification, the type associated with the highest mortality rate. The type of perforations has been reported as being difficult to recognize preoperatively, as with our patient with two inconclusive CT scans. This was due to the absence of classical symptoms of gallbladder perforation. CT is the modality of choice when gallbladder perforation is suspected. We believe the reason for the spontaneous gallbladder perforation in the presented case was the presence of cholecystolithiasis. We acknowledge the importance of considering this diagnosis also in patients without previous signs of cholecystitis."

    "title": "Utility of Ischemia-Modified Albumin as a Biomarker for Acute Appendicitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a frequently encountered surgical emergency. Despite several scoring systems, the possibility of delayed diagnosis persists. In addition, a delayed diagnosis leads to an increased risk of complicated appendicitis. Hence, there is a need to identify biological markers to help clinicians rapidly and accurately diagnose and prognosticate acute appendicitis with a high sensitivity and specificity. Although several markers have been evaluated, the pressing concern is still the low specificity of these markers. One such marker is serum ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), which can be a novel biomarker for accurately diagnosing and prognosticating acute appendicitis. The authors conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases through February 2023 as per the PRISMA guidelines. The difference in the levels of IMA between patients with acute appendicitis vs. healthy controls, and the difference in the levels of IMA between patients with complicated vs. non-complicated acute appendicitis were taken as the outcome measures. Statistical analysis was performed using a random effects model and mean difference (MD) was calculated. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed by utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A total of six prospective comparative studies were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis revealed that the mean level of serum IMA was significantly raised in the acute appendicitis group (MD 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.37, p = 0.01). Similarly, the mean serum IMA levels were also raised in the complicated appendicitis group compared to the non-complicated appendicitis group (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10, p = 0.02). Three of the studies included were, however, of poor methodological quality. Serum IMA is a viable potential marker for diagnosing and prognosticating acute appendicitis. However, due to the limited methodological quality of available studies, further prospectively designed and adequately powered studies are needed."

    "abstract": "Over the past three decades, almost every type of abdominal surgery has been performed and refined using the laparoscopic technique. Surgeons are applying it for more procedures, which not so long ago were performed only in the classical way. The position of laparoscopic surgery is therefore well established, and in many operations it is currently the recommended and dominant method. The aim of the preparation of these guidelines was to concisely summarize the current knowledge on laparoscopy in acute abdominal diseases for the purposes of the continuous training of surgeons and to create a reference for opinions. The development of these recommendations is based on a review of the available literature from the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases from 1985 to 2022, with particular emphasis on systematic reviews and clinical recommendations of recognized scientific societies. Recommendations were formulated in a directive form and evaluated by a group of experts using the Delphi method. There are 63 recommendations divided into 12 sections: diagnostic laparoscopy, perforated ulcer, acute pancreatitis, incarcerated hernia, acute cholecystitis, acute appendicitis, acute mesenteric ischemia, abdominal trauma, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, laparoscopy in pregnancy, and postoperative complications requiring emergency surgery. Each recommendation was supported by scientific evidence and supplemented with expert comments. The guidelines were created on the initiative of the Videosurgery Chapter of the Association of Polish Surgeons and are recommended by the national consultant in the field of general surgery. The first part of the guidelines covers 5 sections and the following challenges for surgical practice: diagnostic laparoscopy, perforated ulcer, acute pancreatitis, incarcerated hernia and acute cholecystitis. Contraindications for laparoscopy and the ERAS program are discussed."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis is a clinical, surgical emergency characterized by an insidious onset, rapid progression, and a high mortality rate. The disease's mortality rate has remained high for many years, mainly because of its atypical clinical presentation, which prevents many cases from being diagnosed early and accurately, resulting in patients who may die from uncontrollable septic shock and multi-organ failure. But unfortunately, no diagnostic indicator can provide a certain early diagnosis of NF, and clinical judgement of NF is still based on the results of various ancillary tests combined with the patient's medical history, clinical manifestations, and the physician's experience. This review provides a brief overview of the epidemiological features of NF and then discusses the most important laboratory indicators and scoring systems currently employed to diagnose NF. Finally, the latest progress of several imaging techniques in the early diagnosis of NF and their combined application with other diagnostic indices are highlighted. We point out promising research directions based on an objective evaluation of the advantages and shortcomings of different methods, which provide a basis for further improving the early diagnosis of NF."

Radiographers' knowledge and practices regarding clinical indications for performing abdominal examinations are crucial in the results radiographs produced. To determine the knowledge and practices of radiographers regarding the clinical indications for performing radiographic examinations of the abdomen. Four public hospitals in the Eastern Cape province, South Africa. A cross-sectional study was conducted, using a convenience, all-inclusive sample of n = 85 radiographers. A hard copy self-administered questionnaire was distributed between February and June 2020. Descriptive (mean and standard deviations) and inferential (chi² test) statistics were generated using IBM® SPSS® version 26.0 software package. Knowledge of clinical indications had a mean of 59.41. All four demographics (age, years of experience, attended a short course and attended pattern recognition course) were significantly associated with overall knowledge. Additionally, short course attendance was significantly associated with most practice items, and two knowledge items (which views are done for perforation; and which view(s) demonstrate a stab abdomen). Pattern recognition was significantly associated with one knowledge item (which views are regarded as an acute abdomen). Despite the lack of short courses and pattern recognition courses, radiographers' knowledge of clinical indications was good (>50%). Continuous training, accessible protocols for performing clinical indications for plain abdominal radiographic examinations for radiographers, audit, feedback and reminders to enhance protocol adherence are recommended. The study findings could be used to enhance knowledge and practices regarding clinical indications for plain abdominal radiographic examinations among radiographers."

    "abstract": "Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare benign neoplasm of the soft tissue. Primary desmoid neoplasms rarely occur in the small bowel and are primarily found in patients with a previous abdominal surgery or irradiation history. They are challenging to diagnose at the time of presentation due to a lower incidence and their non-specific presentation making it difficult to distinguish from other intra-abdominal neoplasms, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which may present with similar symptoms. We like to present a case of a 34-year-old male with a four-day history of abdominal pain with worsening severity and one episode of non-bloody vomiting. Physical examination was significant for generalized abdominal tenderness with positive rebound and board-like rigidity. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed the presence of a lower abdominal mass of unknown etiology with free air foci and free intraperitoneal fluid either due to rupture of the suspicious mass or secondary to infection by an air-producing organism. The patient was immediately taken for emergency surgery, the tumor was resected successfully, and a specimen collected was sent for histopathology, which came out to be a desmoid tumor. We aim to highlight the importance of keeping a broad differential diagnosis in a patient with acute abdomen and symptoms of peritonitis."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency. It obstructs the blood supply to the testes, leading to testicular ischemia and necrosis. It presents with a sudden onset of severe unilateral testicular pain associated with nausea/vomiting, swollen scrotum, and high-riding testicles with an absent cremasteric reflex and negative Prehn sign. Prompt diagnosis of ischemic testicles using ultrasonography is challenging for emergency physicians. Color Doppler ultrasound may reveal a relative decrease or absence of blood flow in the affected testicle. The most specific ultrasonographic feature was the whirlpool sign of the spermatic cord. Manual detorsion should be performed as soon as possible before surgical intervention. However, manual detorsion may fail because of patient discomfort, incomplete torsion, and rotation of the testicle in a less common direction. We report a case demonstrating ultrasound-guided detorsion in a 14-year-old boy with right testicular torsion. The present case highlights the importance of incorporating ultrasound guidance into manual detorsion, which can improve the success rate of the procedure."

    "abstract": "The present study focuses on ileosigmoid knotting (ISK), an infrequent but potentially lethal surgical emergency. ISK is more frequently observed in males and is prevalent in regions with high rates of sigmoid volvulus. The current medical scenario revolves around the intricate intertwining of the ileum and sigmoid colon, leading to a complicated volvulus. This condition often results in acute intestinal obstruction, which can subsequently cause bowel necrosis. The clinical presentation of the condition is characterized by symptoms such as abdominal distention, pain, vomiting, and obstipation, which can be misleading as they are similar to other common abdominal conditions. A delay in definitive diagnosis and intervention is likely, which can lead to severe consequences such as peritonitis, bowel necrosis, sepsis, and even septic shock. Our case report discusses an instance of ISK presenting as an acute abdomen requiring an emergency laparotomy and detorsion of the volvulus-knotted segment, followed by an elective sigmoidectomy. The significance of a heightened level of suspicion, prompt decision-making, and timely surgical intervention in achieving better patient outcomes cannot be overstated. The objective is to enhance the medical community's understanding of ISK, focusing on early diagnosis and effective treatment of this rare but life-threatening disease."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency. Previous studies have shown the value computed tomography (CT) scanning in both confirming this diagnosis and identifying indications for urgent surgical intervention, such as strangulated bowel or closed loop obstructions. However, most of the literature is based on retrospective expert review of previous imaging and little data regarding the real-time accuracy of CT reporting is available. Here, we investigated the real-world accuracy of CT reporting in patients admitted with SBO. This was a multicentre prospective study including consecutive patients admitted with SBO. The primary outcomes were the sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning for bowel obstruction with ischaemia and closed loop obstruction. Data were retrieved from the original CT reports written by on-call radiologists and compared with operative findings. One hundred seventy-six patients were included, all of whom underwent CT scanning with intravenous contrast followed by operative management of SBO. Bowel obstruction with ischaemia was noted in 20 patients, with a sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning of 40.0% and 85.5%, respectively. Closed loop obstructions were noted in 26 patients, with a sensitivity and specificity of CT scanning of 23.1% and 98.0%, respectively. The real-world accuracy of CT scanning appears to be lower than previously reported in the literature. Strategies to address this could include the development of standardised reporting schemas and to increase the surgeon's own familiarity with relevant CT features in patients admitted with SBO."

This case report describes a postmenopausal woman with a large left ovarian cyst measuring 18 × 20 × 22 cm who experienced adnexal torsion, which is a rare occurrence in this age group. To avoid the potential requirement for additional surgical procedures in case of cyst recurrence in the remaining ovary or the development of uterine diseases a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with cystectomy were performed. Histopathological analysis of the cyst confirmed that it was a benign serous cystadenoma of the ovary. Adnexal torsion can happen at any age but is less likely to occur after menopause. Moreover, giant ovarian cysts (>10 cm) are uncommon, making adnexal torsion on these cysts a rare event. While laparotomy remains the gold standard surgical intervention, laparoscopy is beginning to play a role in management of giant cyst. This report documenting a rare case of adnexal torsion in a postmenopausal woman following a serous giant cystadenoma emphasizes that this surgical emergency can occur at any age. In addition, the report highlights that the presence of an ovarian mass or cyst increases the risk of adnexal torsion, regardless of age."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a surgical emergency with a mortality of 1-2% per hour. Since its discovery over 200 years ago, surgical techniques for repairing a dissected aorta have evolved, and with the introduction of hypothermic circulatory arrest and cerebral perfusion, complex techniques for replacing the entire aortic arch were possible. However, postoperative neurological complications contribute significantly to mortality in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the association between different bilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) times and the incidence of postoperative ischemic stroke in patients with emergency surgery for ATAAD. Patients with documented hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, clinical signs of stroke or neurological dysfunction prior to surgery, that died on the operating table or within 48 h after surgery, from whom the postoperative neurological status could not be assessed, and with incomplete medical records were excluded from this study. The diagnosis of postoperative stroke was made using head computed tomography imaging (CT) when clinical suspicion was raised by a neurologist in the immediate postoperative period. For selective bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion, we used two balloon-tipped cannulas inserted under direct vision into the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery. Each cannula is connected to a separate pump with an independent pressure line. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used in all cases for cerebral oxygenation monitoring. The circulatory arrest was initiated after reaching a target core temperature of 25-28 °C. In total, 129 patients were included in this study. The incidence of postoperative ischemic stroke documented on a head CT was 24.8% (31 patients), and postoperative death was 20.9% (27 patients). The most common surgical technique performed was supravalvular ascending aorta and Hemiarch replacement with a Dacron graft in 69.8% (90 patients). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 210 +/- 56.874 min, the mean aortic cross-clamp time was 114.775 +/- 34.602 min, and the mean cerebral perfusion time was 37.837 +/- 18.243 min. Using logistic regression, selective ACP of more than 40 min was independently associated with postoperative ischemic stroke (OR = 3.589; 95%CI = 1.418-9.085; p = 0.007). Considering the high incidence of postoperative stroke in our study population, we concluded that bilateral selective ACP should be used with caution, especially in patients with severely calcified ascending aorta and/or aortic arch and supra-aortic vessels. All efforts should be made to minimize the duration of circulatory arrest when using bilateral selective ACP with a target of less than 30 min, in hypothermia, at a body temperature of 25-28 °C."

    "abstract": "An obturator hernia is a rare cause of bowel obstruction. Due to its narrow passage in the obturator canal, these are more susceptible to becoming incarcerated and subsequently strangulated. Due to its challenging detection, obturator hernia is often diagnosed late. A 75-year-old thin-built female with COPD presented to the emergency room with symptoms of abdominal obstruction. Abdominal examination revealed distension, firmness, rigidity, and tenderness with no bowel sounds. An erect abdominal X-ray showed multiple air-fluid levels, indicating an acute abdomen due to intestinal obstruction. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed an obturator hernia with strangulated ileum and perforation, necessitating resection and double barrel ileostomy. Unfortunately, despite all medical interventions, the patient succumbed to hospital-acquired pneumonia following the surgery. Obturator hernia, known as 'the skinny old woman hernia,' is rarely externally visible or palpable, leading to frequent undiagnosed cases. It presents with bowel obstruction or perforation and carries the highest morbidity among abdominal hernias. Timely intervention is crucial to prevent complications like bowel strangulation. This case report highlights the challenges of diagnosing and managing obturator hernia, a rare condition with significant morbidity. Early detection through imaging or operative findings is crucial to prevent complications like bowel strangulation, especially in older women at higher risk."

A 32 -year-old woman presented to emergency department, 14 weeks post-partum, with sharp left sided abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Initial computed tomography (CT) was suggestive of non-specific colitis from transverse to descending colon of unclear cause. Six hours into admission she became haemodynamically unstable with abdominal peritonism resulting in emergency laparotomy. Intra-operative findings showed large volume haemoperitoneum with an active bleed from the middle colic artery. Symptoms and clinical presentation of Idiopathic spontaneous intraperitoneal haemorrhage is variable and ranges from vague abdominal pain to haemorrhagic shock. A latent period of several hours may be followed by a rapid progression of symptoms owing to rapidity of extravasation[3]. Pathogenesis has been suggested to arise from the increased physiologic demands during the intrapartum period, wherein repeated distension of vessels and increased tortuosity leads to a predisposition for rupture [4]. Diagnosis of Idiopathic spontaneous intraperitoneal haemorrhage is difficult but should be a differential in those who are post-partum presenting with abdominal pain. Patients should be assessed with CT angiography and treatment focused around aggressive resuscitation, surgical exploration, and ligation [3]."

    "abstract": "Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) represents an acute, severe complication of relative insulin deficiency and a common presentation of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) primarily and, occasionally, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents. It is characterized by the biochemical triad of hyperglycaemia, ketonaemia and/or ketonuria, and acidaemia. Clinical symptoms include dehydration, tachypnoea, gastrointestinal symptoms, and reduced level of consciousness, precipitated by a variably long period of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. The present review aims to summarize potential pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of DKA. A literature review was conducted using the Pubmed/Medline and Scopus databases including articles published from 2000 onwards. Diagnostic challenges include differentiating between T1DM and T2DM, between DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS), and between DKA and alternative diagnoses presenting with overlapping symptoms, such as pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, acute abdomen, and central nervous system infection. The mainstays of DKA management include careful fluid resuscitation, timely intravenous insulin administration, restoration of shifting electrolyte disorders and addressing underlying precipitating factors. However, evidence suggests that optimal treatment remains a therapeutic challenge. Accurate and rapid diagnosis, prompt intervention, and meticulous monitoring are of major importance to break the vicious cycle of life-threatening events and prevent severe complications during this potentially fatal medical emergency."

    "title": "Reasons for Delayed Diagnosis of Pediatric Acute Appendicitis during the COVID-19 Era: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Global pandemics cause health system disruptions. The inadvertent disruption in surgical emergency care during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been the topic of several published studies. Our aim was to summarize the reasons that led to the delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 era. This systematic literature search evaluated studies containing pediatric appendicitis patient data regarding outcomes, times to hospital admission or times from symptom onset to emergency department visit. Studies elucidating reasons for delays in the management of pediatric appendicitis were also reviewed. Ultimately, 42 studies were included. Several reasons for delayed diagnosis are analyzed such as changes to public health measures, fear of exposure to COVID-19, increased use of telemedicine, COVID-19 infection with concurrent acute appendicitis, recurrence of appendicitis after non-operative management and increased time to intraoperative diagnosis. Time to hospital admission in conjunction with patient outcomes was extracted and analyzed as an indicative measure of delayed management. Delayed diagnosis of acute appendicitis has been documented in many studies with various effects on outcomes. Suspicion of pediatric acute appendicitis must always lead to prompt medical examination, regardless of pandemic status. Telemedicine can be valuable if properly applied. Data from this era can guide future health system policies."

    "title": "Neonatal Intestinal Segmental Volvulus: What Are the Differences with Midgut Volvulus?",
    "abstract": "Intestinal volvulus in the neonate is a surgical emergency caused by either midgut volvulus (MV) with intestinal malrotation or less commonly, by segmental volvulus (SV) without intestinal malrotation. The aim of our study was to investigate if MV and SV can be differentiated by clinical course, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes. Using a defined search strategy, two investigators independently identified all studies comparing MV and SV in neonates. PRISMA guidelines were followed, and a meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3. Of 1,026 abstracts screened, 104 full-text articles were analyzed, and 3 comparative studies were selected (112 patients). There were no differences in gestational age (37 vs. 36 weeks), birth weight (2,989 vs. 2,712 g), and age at presentation (6.9 vs. 3.8 days). SV was more commonly associated with abnormal findings on fetal ultrasound (US; 65 vs. 11.6%; p < 0.00001). Preoperatively, SV was more commonly associated with abdominal distension (32 vs. 77%; p < 0.05), whereas MV with a whirlpool sign on ultrasound (57 vs. 3%; p < 0.01). Bilious vomiting had similar incidence in both (88 ± 4% vs. 50 ± 5%). Intraoperatively, SV had a higher incidence of intestinal atresia (2 vs. 19%; p < 0.05) and need for bowel resection (13 vs. 91%; p < 0.00001). There were no differences in postoperative complications (13% MV vs. 14% SV), short bowel syndrome (15% MV vs. 0% SV; data available only from one study), and mortality (12% MV vs. 2% SV). Our study highlights the paucity of studies on SV in neonates. Nonetheless, our meta-analysis clearly indicates that SV is an entity on its own with distinct clinical features and intraoperative findings that are different from MV. SV should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in all term and preterm babies with bilious vomiting after MV was ruled out-especially if abnormal fetal US and abdominal distension is present."

    "title": "Testicular Rupture Following Motorcycle Accident.",
    "abstract": "Testicular rupture is a surgical emergency necessitating prompt diagnosis and intervention to prevent irreversible damage. Blunt trauma, including motorcycle collisions, is a common cause of testicular rupture. In the case of multi-trauma, the diagnosis of testicular rupture may be missed in the rush to surgical intervention of more grossly obvious injuries. We present a case of a 24-year-old male who suffered a motorcycle accident and subsequently presented with diffuse abdominal and hip pain. Physical exam and imaging at the emergency department showed multiple pelvic bone fractures, along with a small scrotal injury which was triaged below his pelvic injuries. His pelvic fractures were immediately operated on. Nearly 18 hours after his initial presentation, the patient received a scrotal ultrasound which demonstrated a rupture of the right testicle. Due to this long delay in diagnosis, his urological team opted for non-surgical management and instead employed a more conservative treatment regimen involving pain control, scrotal support, rest, and serial scrotal ultrasounds. This case highlights the importance of timely ultrasound examination for testicular pathology in the setting of multi-trauma and known scrotal injury. Another highlight of this case is the showcase of an uncommon treatment regimen utilizing conservative tactics as opposed to opting for surgical intervention."

    "title": "Machine Learning for Decision-Support in Acute Abdominal Pain - Proof of Concept and Central Considerations.",
    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom in the emergency department and represents heterogeneous causes and diagnoses. There is often a decision to be made regarding emergency surgical care. Machine learning (ML) could be used here as a decision-support and relieve the time and personnel resource shortage.Patients with acute abdominal pain presenting to the Department of Surgery at Bonn University Hospital in 2020 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical parameters as well as laboratory values were used as predictors. After randomly splitting into a training and test data set (ratio 80 to 20), three ML algorithms were comparatively trained and validated. The entire procedure was repeated 20 times.A total of 1357 patients were identified and included in the analysis, with one in five (n = 276, 20.3%) requiring emergency abdominal surgery within 24 hours. Patients operated on were more likely to be male (p = 0.026), older (p = 0.006), had more gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea: p < 0.001, vomiting p < 0.001) as well as a more recent onset of pain (p < 0.001). Tenderness (p < 0.001) and guarding (p < 0.001) were more common in surgically treated patients and blood analyses showed increased inflammation levels (white blood cell count: p < 0.001, CRP: p < 0.001) and onset of organ dysfunction (creatinine: p < 0.014, quick p < 0.001). Of the three trained algorithms, the tree-based methods (h2o random forest and cforest) showed the best performance. The algorithms classified patients, i.e., predicted surgery, with a median AUC ROC of 0.81 and 0.79 and AUC PRC of 0.56 in test sets.A proof-of-concept was achieved with the development of an ML model for predicting timely surgical therapy for acute abdomen. The ML algorithm can be a valuable tool in decision-making. Especially in the context of heavily used medical resources, the algorithm can help to use these scarce resources more effectively. Technological progress, especially regarding artificial intelligence, increasingly enables evidence-based approaches in surgery but requires a strictly interdisciplinary approach. In the future, the use and handling of ML should be integrated into surgical training. Akute Bauchschmerzen sind ein häufiges Leitsymptom in der Notaufnahme und repräsentieren heterogene Ursachen und Diagnosen. Es ist oftmals eine Entscheidung bez. einer notfallmäßigen operativen Versorgung zu treffen. Maschinelles Lernen (ML) könnte hierbei als Entscheidungshilfe eingesetzt werden und der zeitlichen und personellen Ressourcenknappheit entlastend entgegenwirken.Patienten mit akuten Bauchschmerzen, die sich in den Jahren 2020 und 2021 in der Chirurgie des Universitätsklinikums Bonn vorstellten, wurden retrospektiv analysiert. Klinische Parameter sowie Laborwerte wurden als Prädiktoren verwendet. Nach Aufteilung in einen Trainings- und Testdatensatz (Verhältnis 80:20) wurden 3 ML-Algorithmen vergleichend trainiert und validiert. Dieser Vorgang wurde 20-mal wiederholt.Insgesamt wurden 1357 Patienten identifiziert und in die Auswertung eingeschlossen, wobei jeder 5. (n = 276; 20,3 %) innerhalb von 24 h eine abdominelle Notfalloperation benötigte. Die zeitnah operierten Patienten waren häufiger männlich (p = 0,026), älter (p = 0,006) und wiesen vermehrt gastrointestinale Symptome (Übelkeit: p < 0,001; Erbrechen p < 0,001) sowie einen rezenteren Schmerzbeginn (p < 0,001) auf. Druckschmerz (p < 0,001) und Abwehrspannung (p < 0,001) zeigten sich gehäuft und laborchemisch konnte ein erhöhtes Inflammationsniveau (Leukozyten: p < 0,001; CRP: p < 0,001) sowie beginnende Organdysfunktionen (Kreatinin: p < 0,014; Quick p < 0,001) beobachtet werden. Von den 3 trainierten Algorithmen zeigte der Entscheidungsbaum-basierte h2o Random Forest die beste Performance. Der Algorithmus klassifizierte die Patienten, d. h. sagte eine Operation voraus, mit einer AUC ROC von 0,81 (95%-KI: 0,75–0,87) und einer AUC PRC von 0,56 (95%-KI: 0,44–0,67).Es gelang ein Proof-of-Concept mit der Entwicklung eines ML-Modelles zur Vorhersage einer zeitnahen operativen Therapie beim akuten Abdomen. Der ML-Algorithmus kann ein wertvolles Werkzeug in der Entscheidungsfindung sein. Besonders vor dem Hintergrund stark beanspruchter medizinsicher Ressourcen kann der Algorithmus helfen, diese knappen Ressourcen effektiver einzusetzen. Der technische Fortschritt, insbesondere im Hinblick auf künstliche Intelligenz, ermöglicht zunehmend evidenzbasierte Ansätze in der Chirurgie, erfordert allerdings ein streng interdisziplinäres Vorgehen. Zukünftig sollte der Einsatz und Umgang mit ML in die Ausbildung von Chirurgen integriert werden."

    "abstract": "Appendiceal diverticulitis (AD) represents a rare cause of acute abdomen. Diagnosis of AD is a challenge because of its rarity and resemblance to other ileocecal diseases like as cecal diverticulitis (CD) and acute appendicitis (AA). Preoperative imaging can be useful to aid diagnosis. Surgery represents the correct treatment of AD. A 48-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain and fever. Physical examination revealed RLQ abdominal pain and rebound tenderness with muscle guarding. Laboratory tests reported high levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Abdominal computed tomography(CT) scan showed findings of AA and a thin-walled 5 mm appendiceal diverticulum. The patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful, the patient was discharged on the 5th postoperative day in a stable condition. Gross anatomy confirmed the presence of appendiceal diverticulum in the distal appendix on the mesenteric border. Histopathological examination revealed an inflamed and perforated appendiceal pseudo-diverticulum with surrounding AA and peri-appendicitis. Appendiceal diverticulosis is an uncommon entity, classified as congenital or acquired based on the number of appendiceal layers herniating through the normal wall. Two thirds of diverticula will develop acute or chronic diverticulitis that can lead to several complications some of which can be life-threatening. AD is a rare surgical emergency and represents often an overlooked diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality Appendectomy represents a safe and appropriate treatment of AD."

This study investigated the feasibility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for diagnosing TT in the pediatric emergency department (ED). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients, aged 18 years or younger, who visited a university-affiliated hospital pediatric ED with acute scrotal pain without trauma history and underwent diagnostic ultrasounds between January 2010 and October 2022. This study included 731 patients (median age: 9 years), Of these, 315 (43%) were in the POCUS-performed group: 188 in the POCUS-only group, and 127 in the POCUS-and-RADUS group. The other 416 patients (56.9%) were in the RADUS-only group. In total, 45 patients (6.2%) were diagnosed with TT (19 in the POCUS-performed group and 26 in the RADUS-only group). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of POCUS for diagnosing TT were 94.7%, 92.9%, 46.2%, and 99.6%, respectively. The median time to perform POCUS was shorter than RADUS (23 versus 61 minutes, P < .001). The POCUS-performed group had a shorter ED length of stay than the RADUS-only group (93 versus 170 minutes, P < .001). Among the patients diagnosed with TT, performing POCUS first did not significantly delay the ED process, including time to operation (250 versus 205 minutes, P = .142). For patients with acute scrotal pain, evaluation performed by pediatric emergency physicians using POCUS performs well in screening TT, and can decrease length of stay in the ED."

    "abstract": "Intestinal knot formation is a condition wherein two segments of the intestine are knotted together; however, reports of small-intestinal ileo-ileal knot formation are rare. The patient was a 62-year-old Asian male with a history of endoscopic colorectal adenoma resection and a spontaneous pneumothorax. The patient had no history of a laparotomy. He consulted his local doctor with the chief complaint of abdominal pain and was admitted to our hospital with suspicion of an acute abdomen. The abdomen had muscular guarding with tenderness and rebound tenderness. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed torsion of the mesentery of the small intestine with poor contrast filling. The patient was referred to our department with strangulated bowel obstruction and underwent an emergency laparotomy. Intraoperative findings revealed that two segments of the ileum were wrapped around each other to form a knot, and the strangulated small bowel was necrotic. After the release of the knot, partial resection of the small intestine was performed from 220 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz to 80 cm proximal to the cecum. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged on the 11th postoperative day. Ileo-ileal knots should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis when treating strangulated bowel obstruction."

    "abstract": "Primary and metastatic carcinoma of the small intestine are rare. While most of these malignancies are adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the gastrointestinal tract is uncommon. We present a case report of a rare occurrence of skin SCC metastasizing to the ileum, highlighting diagnostic challenges and clinical implications. An 83-year-old female had a history of cutaneous SCC excision in the right temporal region two years prior to the current emergency department visit, followed by metastatic recurrence in a right intra-parotid lymph node treated with radiotherapy. The patient exhibited septic shock and an acute abdomen, and an abdominal computed tomography scan revealed signs of intestinal perforation. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed purulent peritonitis and perforation of the terminal ileum. Subsequently, a 20 cm intestinal resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed a 4 cm perforated SCC of the small intestine (pT4 pN0 L0 V1 Pn0 R0). Metastases of the small intestine are rare. The primary sites for these metastases are typically the uterus, cervix, colon, lung, breast, or melanoma. SCC of the small intestine is particularly rare and poses challenges in diagnosis owing to non-specific symptoms. The prognosis for SCC of the small intestine is generally poor, and the potentially aggressive behavior of some skin SCC emphasizes the need for increased awareness and vigilance in managing such cases. This case report underscores the importance of considering metastatic disease in the small bowel of patients with a history of skin SCC who present with new-onset abdominal symptoms."

    "abstract": "Unlike acute diverticulitis, giant diverticulum larger than 4 cm is a rare entity with few cases described in the literature. We present a case of a 66-year-old male patient diagnosed with colonic diverticulosis. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute abdomen and was diagnosed by CT scan with a 13x14 cm giant diverticulum showing signs of complication. Given the findings, an urgent surgical intervention was decided, and diverticulectomy at the diverticular neck was performed using an endostapler. The etiology of giant diverticula is related to a mechanism of one-way valve at the diverticular neck. Diagnosis poses a challenge as the clinical presentation is nonspecific. The imaging modality of choice is CT scan, which reveals a large cystic image dependent on the sigmoid colon. Definitive treatment is surgical, either by resecting the affected segment including the lesion or by performing a simple diverticulectomy in uncomplicated cases."

Necrotizing enterocolitis or bowel necrosis is a surgical emergency defined by cellular death because of reduced blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract. We report a case of a 75-year-old female who was diagnosed with hyperviscosity syndrome (HVS) and was sent to ED. Further workup showed that she had a new diagnosis of IgG kappa MM for which she was started on chemotherapy. Later, she developed respiratory distress and abdomen distention with less frequent bowel movements, and general surgery was consulted. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed findings consistent with bowel ischemia vs infarction. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room, and exploratory laparotomy showed nonsurvivable bowel necrosis. She was transitioned to comfort care and passed away later.

Obstructed inguinal hernia is still considered the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in Sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries, but its incidence appears to be on the decrease as other causes of intestinal obstruction become more common in a particular society. To examine the spectrum of causes of intestinal obstruction in a tertiary hospital in southern Nigeria and compare the results with earlier studies in the region and Nigeria. A cross sectional, single-hospital study of adults diagnosed with and having clinical and radiological features of acute intestinal obstruction. Seventy patients were enrolled in the study, comprising of 35 (50%) males and 35 (50%) females, M:F = 1:1. The mean patient age was 44.8 years. Two peak age incidences of intestinal obstruction were observed in the 36-45 and 56-65 years age groups. Post-operative adhesion 13 (18.5%), obstructed external abdominal hernia 13 (18.5%), colonic cancer 11 (16%), and intussusception seven (10%) were the primary causes of intestinal obstruction. Obstructed inguinal hernia was commonly encountered in males while adhesions and colonic cancers were common in females. Obstructed external abdominal hernias and post-operative adhesion are at par as the main primary causes of intestinal obstruction. Colon cancer and intussusception are increasingly causing more obstructions."

    "abstract": "Approximately 30 % of population can have an accessory spleen, which is most often asymptomatic. Only when it becomes large in size, it may elicit symptoms, mostly due to complications, such as torsion, infarction, or traumatic hemorrhage. The preoperative diagnosis of an accessory spleen is often challenging due to its propensity to manifest the neoplasms of adjacent organs. Here we report a rare case of a huge tortured accessory spleen mimicking splenic lymphangioma and to review the literature. A 27-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department following left hypochondrial pain that lasted for three days. The computed tomography scan findings demonstrate the spleen in its normal position, showing smooth outlines attached to a similar-density cystic heterogenous mass exhibiting strong radiological evidence of splenic lymphangioma. Surgical excision was performed, and a large tortured accessory spleen was discovered that was attached to the lower pole of the spleen by connective tissue. An accessory spleen is always smaller than 4 cm, and accessory spleens larger than that, especially with torsion, are extremely uncommon. According to literature, the identification of accessory spleen on the basis of clinical and radiological features is very difficult, especially when the patient presents with symptoms of acute abdomen. Considering the fact that accessory splenic tissue can mimics neoplasms of the spleen or nearby organs, it should be included in the differential diagnosis in an undiagnosed pre- or intraoperative hypochondrial mass, located in the vicinity of the spleen."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis in children refers to the acute inflammation of the appendix, which accounts for 20% ∼ 30% of cases of acute abdomen in pediatric surgery. This study aimed to establish a decision tree model of complicated appendicitis in children using appendiceal ultrasound combined with an inflammatory index and evaluated its clinical efficacy in pediatric patients. A total of 395 children admitted to the Emergency Department of the Shanghai Children's Hospital from January 2018 to December 2021 and diagnosed with appendicitis by postoperative pathology were retrospectively analyzed. According to the postoperative pathology, the children were divided into a complicated and non-complicated appendicitis group, respectively. Routine laboratory inflammatory indicators, including white blood cell count, N(%), neutrophil (Neu) count, Neu/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin were collected from the two groups. Collecting data on ultrasound examination of the appendix includes whether the appendix diameter is thickened, whether the echogenicity of the mesenteric rim surrounding the appendix is enhanced, whether there is rich blood supply in the appendix, and whether there are fecaliths in the appendix lumen. The risk factors for complicated appendicitis were screened out by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, the binary logistic regression prediction and decision tree models were established, respectively, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to verify the accuracy of the two prediction models. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that CRP, NLR, the presence of an appendicolith, and peripheral retina echo enhancement were independent risk factors for complicated appendicitis in children (P< 0.05). The decision tree model had an overall accuracy of 79%, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.809 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.780-0.865), and sensitivity and specificity of 71.3% and 77.7%, respectively. The logistic regression model had an overall accuracy of 74.9%, an AUC value of 0.823 (95% CI, 0.765-0.853), a sensitivity value of 80.3%, and a specificity of 71.8%. This predictive model, based on ultrasound of the appendix combined with inflammatory markers, provides a useful method to assist pediatric emergency physicians in diagnosing childhood appendicitis. The decision tree model reflected the interaction of various indexes, and the model was simple, intuitive, and effective."

We report a rare case of a patient with a voluminous enterocele and initial signs of intestinal ischemia who underwent urgent vaginal surgery. An 80-year-old woman presented with a voluminous mass protruding from the vagina, associated abdominopelvic pain, a 10-day history of bowel sub-occlusion, and numerous episodes of profuse vaginal bleeding. She was diagnosed with an enterocele with early signs of complications. Owing to her advanced clinical condition and comorbidities, we opted for an urgent vaginal procedure. Intestinal loops with initial signs of ischemia were resected via a transvaginal approach, leading to good clinical outcomes. She was discharged on postoperative day 5. This rare case highlights a surgical emergency that was managed with transvaginal resection of the intestine. Early identification of the initial signs of complications allowed for this less invasive approach, resulting in reduced morbidity and length of hospital stay."

According to limited evidence, each etiology of TBN might demonstrate a different CT finding. This investigation aimed to 1) identify overall CT findings of TBN, and 2) compare CT findings of TBN in each etiology. Forty-nine consecutive adults (mean age, 64.6 years; 26 men) with occlusive AMI, nonocclusive AMI or SBO, and pathologically proven TBN were enrolled. All had a CT scan within 24 h before surgery. Clinical information was compiled from medical records. CT examinations were re-reviewed by two radiologists with disagreements resolved by the third radiologist. Data were analyzed and compared. Transmural bowel necrosis were secondary to arterial AMI, venous AMI, combined arterial and venous AMI, nonocclusive AMI, and SBO in 6, 5, 2, 10, and 26 patients, respectively. The CT findings were ascites (93.9%), abnormal wall enhancement (91.8%), bowel dilatation (89.8%), mesenteric fat stranding (89.8%), abnormal wall thickness (71.5%), pneumatosis (46.9%) and intrinsic hyperattenuation of bowel walls (22.5%). Portovenous gas, mesenteric venous gas, and pneumoperitoneum were present in 4 patients (8.2%). Bowel wall thickness was the only CT findings that showed a statistically significant difference among the 5 etiologies of TBN (P = 0.046). Most common CT findings of TBN were ascites, abnormal bowel wall enhancement, dilatation, and mesenteric fat stranding. Wall thickness differentiated five etiologies, being most thickened in venous AMI and normal in arterial AMI."

    "title": "Rare Hernias as Surgical Emergencies: A Case Series of Five Cases.",
    "abstract": "Hernia is one of the most common clinically diagnosed cases seen in day-to-day practice. But some of them might pose a challenge in diagnosing the condition and, thus, their further management. Some types of hernias are rare and mimic the common presentation of the acute abdomen, thus requiring extra caution to keep hernias as a differential diagnosis in the acute abdomen. In this series, we report five cases of rare hernias presented to a tertiary care center in northern India over the course of one year. Two cases of paraduodenal hernias (PHs), a right and left, respectively, a male femoral hernia, an Amayand hernia, and an obturator hernia presented as acute abdomen in the emergency department, with challenges in their diagnosis, intraoperative findings, and their outcomes. Computed tomography is a useful diagnostic tool for arriving at the diagnosis pre-operatively in these situations."

    "abstract": "In the coming years, missions to the Moon and Mars shall be the new goals of space flight. The complexity of these missions due to the great distance from Earth and the unforeseen obstacles to settle on another planet have given rise to great concerns for crew health and survival. The need for advanced crew autonomy and a different approach to surgical emergency require new protocols and devices to help future crew medical officers and other crew members in a task of unprecedented difficulty. Hence, the increasing variety of schedules, devices, and protocols being developed. A serious health problem, such as an emerging surgical disease or severe trauma, can jeopardize the mission and survival of the entire crew. Many other difficulties are present in deep-space missions or settlements on other planets, such as communication and supply, also medical, delays, and shortage, and the presence of radiation. Progress in advanced technologies as well as the evolution of robotic surgery and the use of artificial intelligence are other topics of this review. In this particular area of research, even if we are still very far from an \"intelligent robot\", this evolution must be evaluated in the light of legislative and ethical considerations. This topic was presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Surgeons-Italy Chapter in 2021."

    "abstract": "Septic arthritis (SA) in children is an acute inflammatory disease of the joints. If not treated promptly, it could become a surgical emergency. The incidence of the disease in children in Europe is approximately 2-7 per 100,000 children. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate which of these treatments-arthrocentesis, arthrotomy, and arthroscopy-provides better results in children and when to use them. Three independent authors conducted a systematic review of PubMed, ScienceDirect, and MEDLINE databases to assess studies with any level of evidence that reported the surgical outcome of SA. Two senior investigators evaluated and approved each stage's findings. A total of 488 articles were found. After screening, we chose 24 articles that were suitable for full-text reading based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results of our analysis showed that there are no numerically significant differences reported in the literature on clinical and radiographic outcomes by surgical technique. We developed an algorithm that could be used if septic arthritis is suspected. Based on our results, the surgical technique to be used will depend on the operator who will perform it."

    "abstract": "Penetrating traumatic brain injury accompanied by perforating ocular injury caused by low-velocity foreign bodies is a life-threatening condition, a surgical emergency and a major challenge in surgical practice, representing a severe subtype of non-missile traumatic brain injury, which is a relatively rare pathology among civilians. Optimal management of such an injury remains controversial, requiring full understanding of its pathophysiology and a multidisciplinary expert approach. Herein, we report a case of penetrating brain and associated perforating eye injury and discuss relevant literature providing further insight into this demanding complex multi-organ injury. We present a case of 39-year-old male patient with transorbital penetrating brain and perforating ocular injury undergoing emergency surgery to remove a retained sharp metallic object from the left parietal lobe. Following appropriate and urgent diagnostics, a decompressive left-sided fronto-temporo-parietal craniectomy was immediately performed. A retained sharp metallic object (a slice of a round saw) was successfully removed, while primary left globe repair and palpebral and fornix reconstruction were performed afterwards by an ophthalmologist. A prophylactic administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was applied to prevent infectious complications. Early postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged on day 45 post-injury having moderate right-sided motor weakness, ipsilateral facial nerve central palsy, and light motoric dysphasia. The vision to his left eye was completely and permanently lost. In conclusion, management of non-missile transorbital penetrating brain injury can be satisfactory when proper clinical and radiologic evaluation, and amply, less radical surgical approach is performed early. A multidisciplinary routine is a prerequisite in achieving a favorable management outcome."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common type of acute abdomen that requires surgical intervention in children. According to general pediatric textbooks, the presence of vomiting before abdominal pain is considered a classic patient history item for excluding acute appendicitis. However, its diagnostic performance in the pediatric population has yet to be investigated. This was a single-center retrospective observational study involving 134 children who were admitted to the hospital with both abdominal pain and vomiting. The reference standard for appendicitis was defined by computed tomography scanning. The diagnostic performance of \"abdominal pain before vomiting\" was calculated and compared to those of the Alvarado score and pediatric appendicitis score. The diagnostic performance of \"abdominal pain before vomiting\" was as follows: sensitivity of 75.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.7-83.6), specificity of 25.0% (95% CI, 15.5-36.7), positive likelihood ratio of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.82-1.22), negative likelihood ratio of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.54-1.79), and diagnostic odds ratio of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.46-2.25). In contrast, the Alvarado score and pediatric appendicitis score (with a threshold of 4 points) demonstrated favorable sensitivity (98.3% [95% CI, 92.4-99.6]), negative predictive value (94.6% [95% CI, 78.4-98.8]), negative likelihood ratio (0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.23]), and diagnostic odds ratio (49.9 [95% CI, 6.88-243.2]). In this study, \"abdominal pain before vomiting\" was associated with poor diagnostic performance for ruling out acute pediatric appendicitis. Thus, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the pediatric population should be made based on existing validated scoring systems such as the Alvarado score and pediatric appendicitis score."

    "abstract": "Aneurysm of the celiac artery is a rare type of visceral artery aneurysm with an incidence of 0.1 %2%, but it carries a definitive risk of rupture. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) has a remarkable association with a spectrum of arterial diseases, including an occlusive or aneurismal disease. Less often it affects celiac arteries. Here we present a case of rupture of celiac artery aneurysm in a patient NF-1 who presented with sudden onset of acute severe epigastric pain with tenderness and guarding in the epigastric region. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed celiac artery aneurysm with evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. As the patient became unstable, we performed emergency laparotomy in the best interest of the patient in our setting, and we barely controlled the source of bleeding. Unfortunately, we could not save the patient as he developed disseminated intravascular coagulation due to a massive blood transfusion. Visceral artery aneurysm should be considered in patients present with an acute abdomen with anemia. As neurofibromatosis is associated with a spectrum of a vascular disease, vascular screening needs to be considered. Even though celiac artery aneurysm is rare, it should be considered as one of the prompt differential diagnoses when patients present with an acute abdomen with anemia to prevent a fatal outcome."

A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose it timely. Mostly infants aged less than a year are vulnerable to this surgical emergency presenting mostly with abdominal distension, vomiting, reluctance to feed and bright red jelly-like stools which, if left unrecognised, may result in the development of ischaemic portion of the gut and catastrophic outcomes. We present the case of a 60-day-old baby who presented in the Paediatric Emergency Department with progressive abdominal distension and bloody stools. Abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel and ultrasound imaging showed a target sign positive for intussusception. The baby was rushed to the operating room (OR) due to delayed presentation, where an uneventful exploratory laparotomy was performed. Acute intestinal intussusception remains a cause of low morbidity and mortality rates if recognised earlier."

    "abstract": "Calcaneus fractures make up only 2% of all fractures, and tongue-type calcaneus fractures represent 25-40% of all calcaneus fractures. While rare, tongue-type calcaneus fractures can put the superficial soft tissue at risk for necrosis and other complications, creating a surgical emergency. This case report describes the care of a patient who presented to a remote island critical-access emergency room after a fall from height. He described severe, sharp pain in the heel and was found to have tenting and blanching of the overlying skin near the injury. These findings suggested the soft tissues were at high risk for necrosis if not treated immediately. An X-ray confirmed a tongue-type calcaneus fracture. The patient was splinted in plantar flexion and transported by helicopter to a mainland hospital capable of performing the appropriate surgical reduction. The patient underwent open reduction internal fixation of the calcaneus, relieving pressure on the skin. He tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications. He was discharged the day after surgery with outpatient follow-up. His case was prolonged and required multiple procedures to ultimately achieve appropriate healing. This case illustrates the importance of recognizing fractures presenting with skin involvement since surgical emergencies require prompt intervention to reduce the risk of serious complications such as open fracture from skin breakdown, poor healing, and a slow return to normal activities. It also emphasizes the importance of advocating for expedient patient care to increase the odds of a good outcome and ensure patients are given high-quality care.

    "abstract": "Peritoneal tuberculosis (PTB) is an infrequent clinical condition that frequently eludes diagnosis. The scarcity of PTB cases underscores the necessity for heightened vigilance within clinical settings to detect its presence. Notably, there has been a noticeable increase in PTB incidence in recent years. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent responsible for PTB, affecting multiple gastrointestinal components such as the peritoneum and hepatobiliary system. Peritoneum is a rare site for TB with broad unspecific symptoms. It can be asymptomatic to periodic signs or mimic the positive peritonitis examinations like our case. We have reported a case of 19-year-old male experiencing progressive abdominal pain. The presence of generalized tenderness and guarding on physical examination prompted us to perform an urgent laparotomy due to suspicion of peritonitis. During the surgery, we observed the peritoneum exhibiting widespread nodularity, resembling a disseminated seeding pattern, along with mild ascites, which raised our suspicion of peritoneal tuberculosis. Subsequently, cytological analysis of the ascitic fluid and histopathological examination of the lesions confirmed our diagnosis of peritoneal TB. We have shared our experience in facing PTB and reviewed recent papers to find further relevant information. The common presentations, probable causes, the role of imaging in diagnosis and the management are discussed for better management strategy and the best surgical decision. Peritoneal tuberculosis is a rare condition with challenging diagnosis. Key symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, ascites, weight loss, and fever. Prompt recognition and treatment are vital for better outcomes."

    "abstract": "Non-traumatic emergency abdominal surgeries are common in most healthcare settings. To a significant extent, the outcomes of treatment are determined by the promptness of surgical interventions. However, the in-hospital waiting time which reflects perioperative promptness remains largely unexplored in developing countries. To describe the preoperative waiting time, identify the causes of delays, and determine subsequent outcomes for non-traumatic emergency abdominal surgeries. A cross-sectional study was conducted at a consultant zonal hospital in northern Tanzania from September 2012 to March 2013. Patients admitted and surgically treated for non-traumatic acute abdominal conditions were consecutively sampled. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from medical records. Delays in surgical interventions were assessed based on observations at the Emergency Department and record analysis. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were used to summarize the data and assess for factors influencing post-operative outcomes, respectively. The study included 111 participants with a median age of 29 years (IQR=18-53). The median in-hospital preoperative waiting was 10.5 hours (IQR=6.6-14.7), with a substantial majority (78.4%) experiencing delays beyond 6 hours. The frequent reasons for delayed surgery included personnel shortage (37.8%), unavailable theater space (31.5%), and investigation-related factors (28.8%). Delayed hospital presentation (symptoms ≥24 hours) (OR=3.9, 95% CI=1.0-14.9) and prolonged waiting time (>6 hours) (OR=2.7, 95% CI=1.0-7.2) were significantly associated (P < 0.05) with in-hospital complications that included wound dehiscence (0.9%), re-operation (3.6%), surgical site infection (18.0%), and complications necessitating Intensive Care Unit admission (36.9%). The in-hospital operative mortality rate was 18.0%. Age of ≤40 years (OR=0.1, 95% CI=0.04-0.4) and ASA-PS class I-II (OR=0.1, 95% CI=0.0-0.3) were identified as significant (P < 0.001) protective factors against operative mortality. These benchmark findings highlight the multifactorial nature of the reasons for delayed surgical interventions and its association with postoperative complications; offering a potential avenue to enhance surgical efficiency in the index and comparable settings."

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological, clinical, surgical, and post-surgical characteristics of acute appendicitis in a Honduran general hospital. A descriptive, quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Mario Catarino Rivas Hospital in San Pedro Sula, Honduras. The study sample consisted of 100 patients admitted with acute appendicitis from January to April 2022. Data on demographic factors, surgical interventions, appendicitis phases, appendix location, and laboratory findings were collected and analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 28.5 years, with a slight male predominance (52%). Timely surgical intervention was performed in 95% of cases within the first 12 hours. The gangrenous phase was observed in 30% of patients, followed by the perforated (24%), edematous (24%), and suppurative (22%). Retrocecal appendicitis accounted for the majority of cases (66%). Moderate leucocytosis (46%) and severe leucocytosis (39%) were associated with acute appendicitis severity. A higher neutrophil percentage was indicative of complicated appendicitis. Computed tomography was underutilized, with only one patient undergoing the examination. This study provides valuable insights into Honduras' epidemiological, clinical, and surgical characteristics of acute appendicitis. Early surgical intervention and laboratory findings, such as leukocyte count and neutrophil percentage, can aid in assessing disease severity. Further research is warranted to understand the unique aspects of acute appendicitis in Central America and optimize patient management. This study highlights the need for multi-centre studies and long-term follow-up to enhance our understanding of appendicitis in similar populations."

The objective of this study was to describe the case of ascariasis causing SBO in a 25-year-old female. A 25-year-old female from southwest Ethiopia presented with a complaint of intermittent crampy abdominal pain of 02 days duration associated with vomiting of ingested matter of 02 to 03 episodes, progressive abdominal distension and failure to pass feces and flatus. On examination, she was acutely sick looking. She has mild abdominal distention and a hyperactive bowel sound. Subsequently, she was resuscitated, broad spectrum antibiotic started, consent taken & operated. Patient discharged on the 7th postoperative day. There have been reports of Ascariasis causing SBO in endemic areas of the tropics and sub-tropics. SBO secondary to the ascaris ball in an adult is very rare and is relevant to present as it adds key clinical lessons in the consideration as a differential diagnosis, investigation clues and patient management. In a patient presented with symptoms and signs suggestive of bowel obstruction, Ascariasis should be considered as a differential diagnosis for those from endemic areas.

Following examination and investigations, a giant lipoma (GL) in the transverse colon was identified via ultrasound which showed the classical \"target sign\" Intussusception among adults is unusual as it accounts for only 1% of bowel obstruction cases. Being colo-colonic makes it even more unlikely since it occurs only in 17% of intestinal obstruction cases. GLs exceeding 5 cm in size can present with a variety of symptoms. Intussusception is an uncommon presentation of a GL. Preoperative diagnosis of GL-induced intussusception is highly improbable and surgical resection is the treatment of choice.

Though adhesions, hernias and malignancies are the common causes of obstruction, various articles describe unusual causes of intestinal obstruction which needs timely surgical interventions to prevent morbidity and mortality. In this case report we present the history of a 50 year old sub-fertile woman who presented with features of intestinal obstruction and confirmed radiologically with both plain x-ray and computed tomography. After conservative management and as the imaging didn't show the cause of obstruction, exploratory laparotomy was performed. There we found have encircling of left fallopian tube around mid-ileum with gangrenous part. Left salphingectomy and bowel resection with side-to-side anastomosis resulted in a favorable outcome. Intestinal obstruction can compromise blood flow to bowel loops leading to gangrene, perforation and death. Awareness, early recognition and timely intervention in intestinal obstruction is mandatory to prevent poor outcomes, especially in cases of unknown cause and not responding to conservative management. The real surgical challenge is not the decision whether to perform surgery, but the decision when and how to perform it."

All patients had air-fluid levels on abdominal X-ray. Abdominal ultrasonography of all patients revealed subileus. Abdominal computed tomography was performed in five patients, and pre-operative colonoscopy was conducted in two patients before the emergency intervention. All of the patients underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy with the preliminary diagnosis of acute abdomen. In two patients, debulking surgery followed by a stoma was performed. The remaining four patients were treated with anastomosis following intestinal resection. All girls had metastases on the ovary. One of the patients died due to the burden of multiple metastases in the early period, and three died in the sixth post-operative year. We have been following the remaining two patients since then. Although signet-ring cell carcinomas (SRCCs) are rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen and intestinal obstruction in pediatric patients.

Early diagnosis is most often a clinical examination, however, laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist in the diagnosis if clinician uncertainty persists. We present a case report of acute exertional compartment syndrome of the medial compartment of the foot after physical activity. A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department the day after playing basketball, with severe atraumatic medial foot pain. Clinical examination demonstrated tenderness and swelling over the medial arch of the foot. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) results at 9500 international units. MRI demonstrated fusiform edema of the abductor hallucis. Subsequent fasciotomy revealed protruding muscle during fascial incision and relieved the patient of their pain. Return to surgery 48 h after initial fasciotomy revealed gray discoloration and lack of contractility of the muscle tissue. The patient was recovering well at the first post-operative visit, however, was lost to follow-up thereafter. Acute exertional compartment syndrome of the medial compartment of the foot is a rarely reported diagnosis, likely due to a combination of missed diagnosis and underreporting. Laboratory tests for CPK may be elevated, and MRI may be helpful in the diagnosis of this condition. Fasciotomy of the medial compartment of the foot relieved the patient's symptoms, and to our knowledge had a good outcome."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a life-threatening soft-tissue infection. While the fulminate form is well documented, the subacute NF is rarely reported. Failure to consider NF as a diagnosis during this indolent presentation can be detrimental to patients because the surgical aggressive debridement remains the key of the treatment. We report a case of a 54-year-old man who developed a subacute NF. After an initial diagnosis of cellulitis, the patient failed to show improvement with antibiotic treatment; he was referred to our institution in view to benefit of a surgical management. The patient developed progressive systemic toxic symptoms and an emergency debridement was made 10 h after his admission. Our patient achieves to show improvement with antibiotic treatment, vacuum-assisted closure therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and reconstructive surgery. Complete recovery was observed after 2 months. NF is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis is essential, it is often ambiguous and commonly misdiagnosed including the subacute form. There needs to be a high suspicion for NF even in patients presenting with cellulitis without systemic symptoms."

The most common cause of small bowel obstruction is adhesions secondary to previous abdominal surgery. While strangulated external hernias are also a common cause of obstructions encountered, internal hernias leading to obstruction are rare. We present a 76-year-old male who presented with an acute abdomen and was later diagnosed with an internal hernia underneath his right external iliac artery.  Internal herniation underneath the iliac vasculature is a recent phenomenon encountered very rarely after the natural anatomy has been disturbed in patients who have undergone pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients with a previous history of pelvic lymph node dissection should be suspected of having an internal hernia if they present with an acute abdomen. Closure of the peritoneum should also be considered in these patients as it may help prevent herniation."

Accurately diagnosing appendicitis and identifying complicated appendicitis can be difficult at times. Objective To evaluate the ability of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. Method This was a prospective hospital-based observational study conducted at the Department of Surgery, Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital from July 2021 to December 2022. Patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis who had undergone emergency appendectomy were included in the study. Informed consent was taken from each patient and data collection was done by filling the proforma. Result A total of 218 patients were included in the study. Male: female ratio was 1.18:1. Mean age of patients was 28.58 ± 16.65 (3-78) years. A significant correlation was found between increasing neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with complicated appendicitis. However, no significant correlation was found between White Blood Cell counts and complicated appendicitis. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 12.6 was found to be associated with complicated appendicitis. Conclusion A simple, cost-effective, and yet perfect test is not available for identifying complicated appendicitis. Increased Neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio can indicate complicated appendicitis. Elevated WBC counts alone has no role in differentiating complicated appendicitis. According to the results of our study, an neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of 12.6 can help to differentiate complicated from uncomplicated appendicitis."

    "abstract": "In the emergency setting, right lower quadrant pain is a common clinical scenario. While acute appendicitis is the most relevant cause, there is a wide differential diagnosis. Valentino syndrome is a rare entity in which gastric or duodenal perforation, usually secondary to peptic ulcer disease, presents clinically with right lower quadrant pain mimicking acute appendicitis. It has its origins in Rudolph Valentino, a famous American actor who died of sepsis following an undiagnosed perforated ulcer after an appendectomy. Nowadays, radiological images play a crucial role in this pathology, historically diagnosed using exploratory laparotomy. Through a clinical case and a review of the literature, we aim to describe the historical evolution of Valentino's syndrome, illustrate its clinical and radiological characteristics and highlight the increasing role of imaging, particularly computed tomography, in its early prospective diagnosis and in guiding targeted treatment. Finally, it is important to consider this pathology when assessing acute abdominal patients with coexisting pneumoperitoneum and appendicitis. En el ámbito de urgencias el dolor en fosa ilíaca derecha es un cuadro clínico frecuente. Aunque la apendicitis aguda es la causa más relevante, existen otros diagnósticos diferenciales. El síndrome de Valentino es una patología infrecuente en la que una perforación gástrica o duodenal, generalmente secundaria a enfermedad ulcerosa péptica, se presenta clínicamente con dolor en el cuadrante inferior derecho, simulando una apendicitis aguda. Tiene su origen en Rudolph Valentino, un famoso actor estadounidense que murió de sepsis secundaria a una úlcera perforada no diagnosticada luego de una apendicectomía. Actualmente, las imágenes radiológicas tienen un papel fundamental en esta patología, históricamente diagnosticada mediante laparotomía exploradora. A través de un caso clínico y la revisión bibliográfica, nuestro objetivo es describir la evolución del síndrome de Valentino, ilustrar sus características clínico-radiológicas y destacar el papel cada vez más importante de las imágenes, especialmente la tomografía computada, para su diagnóstico prospectivo temprano y para orientar el tratamiento dirigido.

    "abstract": "Esophageal perforation is a surgical emergency with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Its poor prognosis is mainly associated with previous patient-specific comorbidities and a lack of timely diagnosis and treatment. The objective of this study was to investigate the etiological factors and different surgical methods of treatment with consideration of mortality rate and comorbidities. The present cross-sectional study was conducted on patients who underwent surgical intervention due to esophageal injury from 2002 to 2019 (18 years). Demographic and clinical characteristics along with performed surgical interventions were evaluated accordingly. In this study, 69 patients with a mean age of 38.8 years were evaluated, of which 45 (65.2%) cases were men. In terms of location of the perforation, the thoracic portion of the esophagus followed by the cervical and abdominal esophagus were more frequently injured with a rate of 32 (46.4%), 30 (43.5%), and 19 (27.5%) cases, respectively. Accordingly, foreign body ingestion followed by penetrating injuries were the most common causative agents leading to esophageal perforation. Obtaining the desired results from the treatment of this condition depends on factors such as patients' previous comorbidities, cause of the rupture, the location of the esophageal damage, and delay in the start of treatment. Since there is no single gold standard treatment strategy, each patient should be individually evaluated."

Adult colocolic intussusception is rare, but it is a severe condition and is usually associated with a presence of a tumoral process. We present the case of a frail male patient admitted to our emergency department with abdominal pain, prostration, and dyspnea. The patient was diagnosed with colocolic intussusception and was submitted to a subtotal colectomy and ileostomy. Patients with colocolic intussusception usually present with chronic abdominal pain and signs of intestinal obstruction. Abdominal CT scan facilitates the diagnosis, but most cases are only diagnosed intraoperatively. Given the high probability of colon cancer, the treatment involves an oncological resection of the intestinal segment.

We present herein a case of acquired diaphragmatic hernia following a peritoneal biopsy for gastric cancer dissemination in the diaphragm. A 72-year-old, female patient presented with a complaint of acute abdomen 10 months after receiving a diagnosis of stage IV gastric cancer with peritoneal dissemination based on peritoneal biopsy findings during staging laparoscopy. Computed tomography demonstrated herniation of the small intestine into the thoracic cavity. Emergency surgery was performed, and a full-thickness diaphragmatic defect was found intraoperatively at the same location as the previous, peritoneal biopsy. The incarcerated small intestine was atraumatically repositioned into the abdominal cavity, and the defect was closed laparoscopically using an absorbable barbed suture. Although complications of staging laparoscopy are extremely rare, excising disseminated nodules from the diaphragm carries the risk of diaphragmatic hernia. For this reason, avoiding excision is desirable unless a diaphragmatic biopsy is needed."

This review summarizes the common routine surgical emergencies in children from LMICs and their effects on morbidity and mortality. A narrative review was undertaken to assess the epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes of common surgical emergencies that present within the first 8000 days (or 21.9 years) of life in LMICs. Available data on pediatric surgical emergency care in LMICs were aggregated. Outside of trauma, acute appendicitis, ileal perforation secondary to typhoid fever, and intestinal obstruction from intussusception and hernias continue to be the most common abdominal emergencies among children in LMICs. Musculoskeletal infections also contribute significantly to the surgical burden in children. These \"neglected\" conditions disproportionally affect children in LMICs and are due to delays in seeking care leading to late presentation and preventable complications. Pediatric surgical emergencies also necessitate heavy resource utilization in LMICs, where healthcare systems are already under strain. Delays in care and resource limitations in LMIC healthcare systems are key contributors to the complicated and emergent presentation of pediatric surgical disease. Timely access to surgery can not only prevent long-term impairments but also preserve the impact of public health interventions and decrease costs in the overall healthcare system."

It was first reported in literature in 1896 and about 400 cases have been reported till date. We reported on a 41 year-old Para 0+0 Ibo house wife who presented with 10 years history of supra-pubic mass and five months history of excessive menstrual flow. After physical examination, a diagnosis of symptomatic uterine fibroid was made. She had myomectomy and the raw surface created after the excision of the myomas was covered with omentum. Wound infection developed on the 8th post-operative day leading to a wound breakdown and later partial extrusion of infarcted omental tissue through the dehisced wound. During re-exploration, the infarcted omental tissue was extracted and the residual abdominal abscess was drained. Surgical site wound infection occurred on the 3rd day after re-operation and a sub-acute intestinal obstruction developed on the 4th day thereafter which responded to conservative management. Careful surgical technique is imperative when utilizing the omentum for reconstructive abdominal surgery. Torsion of the omentum and creation of excess tension while using the omentum for reconstructive procedures should be avoided and increase awareness of this uncommon disease condition by the surgeon is also important. This case is to report a rare finding of omental infarction following myomectomy."

    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. Clinical assessment plays a major role; however, subtle clinical features in early stages and atypical presentation makes diagnosis challenging. Ultrasonography (USG) of the abdomen is a usual investigation that aids in diagnosis, however, it is operator dependent. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen is more accurate; however, it exposes the patient to hazardous radiation. The study aimed to combine clinical assessment and USG abdomen in the reliable diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Objectives The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic reliability of the Modified Alvarado Score and ultrasonography of the abdomen in acute appendicitis. Material and methods All patients with right iliac fossa pain, clinically suspected of having acute appendicitis, admitted to the department of general surgery, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bhubaneswar, between January 2019 and July 2020, who gave consent were included. Clinically, Modified Alvarado Score (MAS) was calculated, after which patients were subjected to USG abdomen, where findings were noted and a sonologic score was calculated. The study group was the patients who needed appendicectomy (n=138). Operative findings were noted. Histopathological diagnosis of acute appendicitis was deemed as confirmatory in these cases and was correlated with MAS and USG scores to determine diagnostic accuracy. Results A combined clinicoradiological (MAS + USG) score of seven showed a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 100%. The specificity of score seven or above was 100%; however, the sensitivity at 81.8%. The diagnostic accuracy of the clinicoradiological was 87.5%. The negative appendicectomy rate was 4.34%, with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis being confirmed for 95.7% of patients upon histopathological examination. Conclusion The MAS and USG of the abdomen, which is an affordable and non-invasive tool, showed increased diagnostic reliability, and hence it can help reduce the use of CECT abdomen, as CECT abdomen is considered as a gold standard for confirmation or exclusion of diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Use of the combined scoring system of MAS and USG abdomen can be used as a cost-effective alternative."

It symbolizes a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis. Feeding jejunostomy (FJ) is a minor surgical intervention, which might lead to consequences that are potentially fatal. Mechanical issues such as infection, tube dislocation or migration, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, as well as complaints of gastrointestinal tract, are the most frequent consequences. A 76-year-old female, who is a known case of carcinoma (CA) esophagus: Stage 4 with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Class 3 presented with complaints of difficulty in swallowing and vomiting. As a part of palliative treatment, FJ is done and patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 2. Patient again presented to emergency department after 2 months with complaints of pain abdomen, unable to pass flatus and stools for 2 days. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was done, which revealed intussusception of jejunum with lead point as tip of feeding tube. Intussusception of jejunal loops is noted 20 centimeters distal to the site of insertion of FJ tube with tip of feeding tube as lead point. Reduction of bowel loops was achieved by gentle compression of distal part and are found to be viable. FJ tube was then removed and repositioned after which the obstruction got relieved. Intussusception is an extremely rare complication of FJ, where the clinical presentation can be likely to the various causes of small bowel obstruction. The fatal complications like intussusception in FJ can be prevented by remembering some technical considerations, such as attaching a 4-5 cm segment of the jejunum to the abdominal wall rather than a single-point fixation and maintaining a minimum distance of 15 cm between the duodenojejunal (DJ) flexure and the FJ site."

To develop a diagnostic algorithm for primary care and emergency physicians to identify patients with possible NF, including an initial approach to triaging such individuals. Medline was searched to identify studies of validated algorithms for NF diagnosis and/or cohort or case series providing clinical and diagnostic features of NF. Candidate algorithms were validated via application to 3 published cases of initially misdiagnosed NF. We retrospectively reviewed NF cases between 2011 and 2022 at our center to validate our algorithm. The search yielded 540 articles; 109 were included following a review of abstracts. No published validated diagnostic algorithm was identified. Using the reported clinical and diagnostic features of NF, we generated an algorithm of the \"3Ds\" of NF: Disproportionate pain, Dermatological findings, and Disorganized physiology. A larger number of Ds indicated a greater level of suspicion for NF and prioritization for urgent surgical consultation. In 3 published cases of missed NF, the 3Ds algorithm successfully identified all as having possible NF. On reviewing our cases, we identified 56 patients with NF during an 11 year period. 66% of whom had the 3Ds at their initial presentation. The 3Ds algorithm, a simple and easy-to-remember tool can be easily applied in a primary or emergency care setting, and may improve the early diagnosis of NF. Retrospective analysis of NF cases allows for validation of this algorithm. However, this algorithm requires prospective validation."

The laparoscopic approach in complicated acute appendicitis is a viable alternative method but is not practiced in all cases because of technical difficulties and unpredictable complications. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the primary and secondary outcome predictors of laparoscopic appendectomy in complicated appendicitis. A single-center prospective observational study was carried out after the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). A total of 87 complicated acute appendicitis patients were included in the study. Clinico-demographic features such as age, gender, duration of surgery, post-operative pain, and hospital stay were monitored in different age groups of <20, 20-39, and >40 years, and the primary and secondary outcomes of laparoscopic surgery in acute complicated appendicitis were measured. Acute complicated appendicitis cases were observed mostly in people older than 42 years in the total study population. Laparoscopic appendectomy was conducted in all 87 acute complicated appendicitis patients, and the major surgical outcome predictors were monitored, such as mean operating time (87.9 minutes), post-operative pain (3.9 scores), and post-operative stay (6.7 days). Post-operative complications such as drain site infection (1.14%), enterocutaneous fistula (2%), and intra-abdominal abscess (7%) were observed. Based on our observations, a laparoscopic appendectomy can be considered a viable alternative with an acceptable complication rate.

To date, no epidemiological article has described the incidence of appendicitis in Lebanon. Our primary objective was to estimate the rate of appendicitis in a single center in Lebanon. Our secondary objectives included identifying differences between simple and complicated appendicitis regarding demographics, pre and postoperative characteristics, and symptoms and signs of appendicitis. Methodology A retrospective study was conducted at a single central university hospital in Lebanon. Patients with a clear diagnosis of acute appendicitis were included. Pregnant women, lactating women, patients with organ dysfunction, and patients younger than 18 years old or older than 80 years old were excluded. We reviewed and collected the data of patients who presented to the hospital between November 2018 and November 2019 and November 2020 and November 2021. Results A total of 95 patients were included in our study, with 35 women and 60 men. The mean body mass index of patients with simple appendicitis was 19.14 ± 9.66 kg/m2 compared to 18.97 ± 10.37 kg/m2 in patients with complicated appendicitis (p = 0.94). A total of 42.3% of patients who used antibiotics 24 hours after the operation had simple appendicitis, whereas 20.8% had complicated appendicitis (p = 0.004). Conclusions Antibiotic usage and the length of hospital stay were correlated with the severity of appendicitis, as reported in the literature. Further randomized studies with a larger number of patients and covering several hospitals in Lebanon are warranted."

However, the molecular pathological mechanism of NEC is still not well understood. This study was designed to provide a molecular basis for the pathogenesis of human NEC through bioinformatics analysis and immune infiltration. For RNA-Seq, DEseq2 algorithm was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to perform functional enrichment analysis. Immune infiltration was analyzed by CIBERSORT algorithm. A total of 34,712 genes were detected and 7463 DEGs were identified in this study. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly involved in CCR1 chemokine receptor binding, transporter activity, growth factor binding, etc. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Th17 cell differentiation, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The immune infiltration profiles varied significantly between NEC, NEC self-control, and normal intestinal tissues. Finally, the expression levels of 21 DEGs were verified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR. Our findings may provide new insights into the development of NEC."

    "title": "[The acute abdomen in children].",
    "abstract": "Because 8-10% of children in the emergency room present with acute abdominal pain, a systematic work-up is essential to rule out acute abdomen. This article highlights the etiology, symptoms, diagnostic workup, and treatment of acute abdomen in children. Review of the current literature. Abdominal inflammation, ischemia, bowel and ureteral obstruction, or abdominal bleeding are causes of acute abdomen. Extra-abdominal diseases such as otitis media in toddlers or testicular torsion in adolescent boys can also lead to symptoms of acute abdomen. Abdominal pain, (bilious) vomiting, abdominal guarding, constipation, blood-tinged stools, abdominal bruise marks, and poor condition of the patient with symptoms such as tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotonia up to shock are leading symptoms of acute abdomen. In some cases, emergent abdominal surgery is needed to treat the cause of the acute abdomen. However, in patients with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporarily associated with SARS-CoV‑2 infection (PIMS-TS), a new disease causing an acute abdomen, surgical treatment is rarely needed. Acute abdomen can lead to nonreversible loss of an abdominal organ, such as bowel or ovary, or develop into acute deterioration of the patient's condition up to the state of shock. Therefore, a complete history and thorough physical examination are needed to timely diagnose acute abdomen and initiate specific therapy. HINTERGRUND: Etwa 8–10 % der pädiatrischen Notfälle präsentieren sich mit akuten Bauchschmerzen. Zum Ausschluss eines akuten Abdomens ist eine gezielte Abklärung notwendig. Dieser Leitartikel gibt einen Überblick über Ursachen, Symptome, Diagnostik und aktuelle Therapieempfehlungen des akuten Abdomens im Kindesalter. Review der aktuellen Literatur. Ursachen eines akuten Abdomens sind in der Regel eine abdominale Entzündung, eine Ischämie, ein Hohlorganverschluss oder eine akute abdominale Blutung. Extraabdominale Erkrankungen, wie eine Otitis media bei Kleinkindern und eine Hodentorsion bei jugendlichen Jungen, können auch Symptome eines akuten Abdomens auslösen. Leitbefunde sind Bauchschmerzen, (galliges) Erbrechen, abdominale Abwehrspannung, Stuhlverhalt, blutiger Stuhl, eine abdominale Prellmarke und ein reduzierter Allgemeinzustand mit Allgemeinsymptomen (Tachykardie, Tachypnoe, Hypotonie) bis zum Schock. In einigen Fällen ist eine (Notfall‑)Operation zur Fokussanierung bzw. zum Organerhalt notwendig. Ein „pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome-temporarily associated with rSARS-CoV‑2 infection“ (PIMS-TS) mit gastrointestinaler Beteiligung ist eine neue Ursache, die ein akutes Abdomen verursachen kann, bei der jedoch selten eine Operationsindikation besteht. Das akute Abdomen kann zu einem Organverlust (z. B. Darm oder Ovar) und zu einer akuten Verschlechterung des Allgemeinzustands des Patienten bis zum Schock führen. Zur rechtzeitigen und zielgerichteten Therapie sind daher eine aufmerksame Anamnese und Untersuchung notwendig."

    "abstract": "Torsion of a uterine leiomyoma is an extremely rare, albeit life-threatening surgical emergency. A 28-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain. Imaging revealed a torsed subserosal uterine leiomyoma which was managed surgically and the diagnosis confirmed intraoperatively as well as on histopathology. While intraoperative findings remain the primary means of diagnosis, radiologists should be familiar with the potential imaging findings of leiomyoma torsion as timely intervention can greatly improve patient outcome."

    "abstract": "ASBO is a frequent abdominal surgical emergency and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in emergency surgery. The aim of this study is to provide insight into the current management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) and associated outcomes. A nationwide prospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted. All patients with clinical signs of ASBO admitted to participating Dutch hospitals were included during a 6 months inclusion period between April 2019 and December 2020. Ninety-day clinical outcomes were described and compared for nonoperative management (NOM) and laparoscopic and open surgery. In 34 participating hospitals, 510 patients were included, of whom 382 (74.9%) had a definitive diagnosis of ASBO. Initial management consisted of emergency surgery in 71 (18.6%) patients and NOM in 311 (81.4%) patients, 119 (31.1%) of whom required delayed surgery after failure of NOM. Surgical interventions started laparoscopically in 51.1%, of which 36.1% were converted to laparotomy. Intentional laparoscopy resulted in shorter hospital stays compared with open surgery (median 8.0 vs. 11.0 days; P <0.001) and comparable hospital mortality (5.2 vs. 4.3%; P =1.000). Oral water-soluble contrast use was associated with a decreased length of stay ( P =0.0001). Hospital stay for surgical patients was shorter in patients who were operated on within 72 h of admission ( P <0.001). This nationwide cross-sectional study demonstrates shorter hospital stay in ASBO patients who received water-soluble contrast, were operated within 72 h of admission or were operated with minimally invasive techniques. Results may support the standardization of ASBO treatment."

However, there have been a few death cases reported after ingesting large amounts of junk food in a short time. A 34-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with acute abdominal pain due to a bad mood and consumption of large amounts of carbonated beverages and puffed foods. Emergency surgery revealed a ruptured dilated stomach combined with severe abdominal infection, and the patient died after the surgery. We should keep in mind the possibility of gastrointestinal perforation in patients with acute abdomen with a history of heavy consumption of carbonated beverages and puffed foods. We need to evaluate the acute abdomen patients after taking large amounts of carbonated beverages and puffed foods in combination with symptoms, signs, inflammatory indicators, imaging and other examinations, and the possibility of gastric perforation needs to be considered, and emergency repair surgery should be arranged."

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is essential for a favorable outcome. Selection of patients requiring a dedicated multiphasic computed tomography (CT) scan remains a clinical challenge. In this cross-sectional diagnostic study conducted from 2016 to 2018, we compared the presentation of AMI patients admitted to an intestinal stroke center to patients with acute abdominal pain of another origin admitted to the emergency room (controls). We included 137 patients-52 with AMI and 85 controls. Patients with AMI [median age: 65 years (interquartile range 55-74)] had arterial and venous AMI in 65% and 35% of cases, respectively. Relative to controls, AMI patients were significantly older, more likely to have risk factors or a history of cardiovascular disease, and more likely to present with sudden-onset and morphine-requiring abdominal pain, hematochezia, guarding, organ dysfunction, higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and higher plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin concentrations. On multivariate analysis, two independent factors were associated with the diagnosis of AMI: the sudden-onset (OR = 20, 95%CI 7-60, p < 0.001) and the morphine-requiring nature of the acute abdominal pain (OR = 6, 95%CI 2-16, p = 0.002). Sudden-onset and/or morphine-requiring abdominal pain was present in 88% of AMI patients versus 28% in controls (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the diagnosis of AMI was 0.84 (95%CI 0.77-0.91), depending on the number of factors. Sudden onset and the need for morphine are suggestive of AMI in patients with acute abdominal pain and should prompt multiphasic CT scan including arterial and venous phase images for confirmation."

    "abstract": "A robust body of literature supports the use of fascia iliaca compartment blocks (FICB) for improving outcomes in hip fractures, especially in the geriatric population. Our objective in this project was to implement consistent pre-surgical, emergency department (ED) FICB for hip fracture patients and to address barriers to implementation. With the support of a multidisciplinary team, including orthopedic surgery and anesthesia, a core team of emergency physicians developed and implemented a departmentwide FICB training and credentialing program. The goal was to have 80% of all emergency physicians credentialed to provide pre-surgical FICB to all hip fracture patients seen in the ED who met the criteria. Following implementation, we assessed approximately one year of data on hip fracture patients presenting to the ED. We evaluated whether or not they were eligible for FICB and, if so, whether or not they received it. Emergency physician education has resulted in 86% of clinicians credentialed to perform FICB. Of 486 patients presenting for hip fracture, 295 (61%) were considered eligible for a block. Of those eligible, (54%) consented and underwent a FICB in the ED. A collaborative, multidisciplinary effort is vital for success. The primary barrier to achieving a higher percentage of eligible patients receiving blocks was the deficit of emergency physicians initially credentialed. Continuing education is ongoing, including credentialing and early identification of patients eligible for the fascia iliaca compartment block."

It's been five decades since the first animal models of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were described. There remains much investigative work to be done on identifying various aspects of NEC, ranging from the underlying mechanisms to treatment modalities. Experimental NEC is mainly focused on a rat, mouse, and piglet models. Our aim is to not only highlight the pros and cons of these three main models, but to also present some of the less-used animal models that have contributed to the body of knowledge about NEC. Choosing an appropriate model is essential to conducting effective research and answering the questions asked. As such, this paper reviews some of the variations that come with each model."

This study aims to obtain knowledge about various DNSI's and their predisposing factors.. It was a hospital based retrospective cross-sectional study done in Goa Medical College, India. A total of 300 patients who presented with DNSI's over the past 7 years were studied. Simple proportions and percentages were calculated and Chi-square test was used to study associations. A total of 300 patients were evaluated and male preponderance was seen. Most of the patients were seen belonging to the pediatric age group (26%). Infections of dental origin (45.67%) were the most common etiological factor associated with poor oral hygiene and tobacco chewing (12.67%). Major comorbidities were anemia (34%) and diabetes (19.3%) which were directly related to the complications. The most common complication was airway compromise (14.66%) which was treated by tracheostomy. DNSI should be treated like a medical as well as a surgical emergency which can be life-threatening especially in diabetics and elderly who are immunocompromised and need special attention. Odontogenic infections associated with poor oral hygiene and tobacco chewing could be prevented by educating the population about oral hygiene."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas (PSCA) are a rare subset of Non-Squamous-Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC), the most common pathological subtype of lung cancers which are the most common malignancy in the world. These rarest of rare tumours may have gastrointestinal metastasis and present as an acute abdominal surgical emergency with bowel obstruction or bleeding, as in our patient, who did not have a diagnosis of lung cancer till then. Use of novel immunohistochemistry markers like thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) may help diagnose the site of the primary tumour with accuracy in this clinical setting. Further evaluation of these patients with positron emission tomography (PET) scans helps determine the tumour burden and degree of dissemination. The aim of this article is to emphasize this rare presentation which may be unsuspected as a cause of bowel obstruction by surgical teams on the acute surgical take due to its rarity. It is vital that nihilism is avoided in these patients as a subset of these patients can still be offered curative metastectomy and treatment of the primary tumour with reasonable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Early cholecystectomy is recommended for acute calculous cholecystitis to reduce complications and lower health care costs. However, not all patients admitted to emergency services due to acute calculous cholecystitis are considered for surgery immediately. Our intention was therefore to evaluate patient management and outcome parameters following cholecystectomy depending on the type of emergency service patients are primarily admitted to. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients that were treated for acute cholecystitis at our hospital between 2014 and 2021. Only patients that underwent surgical treatment for acute calculous cholecystitis were included. Patients with cholecystectomies that were performed due to other medical conditions were not incorporated. Primary outcomes were the perioperative length of stay and postoperative complications. Perioperative antimicrobial management and disease deterioration according to Tokyo Guidelines from 2018 due to inhouse organization were assessed as secondary outcome parameters. Of 512 patients included in our final analysis, 334 patients were primarily admitted to a surgical emergency service (SAG) whereas 178 were initially treated in a medical service (MAG). The latency between admission and cholecystectomy was significantly prolonged in the MAG with a median time to surgery of 2 days (Q25 1, Q75 3.25, IQR 2.25) compared to the SAG with a median time to surgery of 1 day (Q25 1, Q75 2, IQR 1) (p < 0.001). The duration of surgery was comparable between both groups. Necrotizing cholecystitis (27.2% vs. 38.8%, p = 0.007) and pericholecystic abscess or gallbladder perforation (7.5% vs. 14.6% p = 0.010) were less frequently described in the SAG. In the SAG, 85.7% of CCEs were performed laparoscopically, 6.0% were converted to open, and 10.4% were performed as open surgery upfront. In the MAG, 80.9% were completed laparoscopically, while 7.2% were converted and 11.2% were performed via primary laparotomy (p = 0.743). Histologically gangrenous cholecystitis was confirmed in 38.0% of the specimen in the SAG compared to 47.8% in the MAG (p = 0.033). While the prolonged preoperative stay led to prolonged overall length of stay, the postoperative length of stay was similar at a median of 3 days in both groups. To our knowledge, we present the largest single center cohort of acute calculous cholecystitis evaluating the perioperative management and outcome of patients admitted to either medical or surgical service prior to undergoing cholecystectomy. In patients that were primarily admitted to medical emergency services, we found disproportionately more gallbladder necrosis, perforation, and gangrene. Despite prolonged time intervals between admission and cholecystectomy in the MAG and advanced cases of cholecystitis, we did not record a prolonged procedure duration, conversion to open surgery, or complication rate. However, patients with acute calculous cholecystitis should either be primarily admitted to a surgical emergency service or at least a surgeon should be consulted at the time of diagnosis in order to avoid disease progression and unnecessary health care costs."

    "abstract": "The aim was to describe the characteristics of the transport system of critically ill pediatric patients in the emergency departments (EDs) in Latin America (LA). This is a prospective cross-sectional study in a 1-year period. Patients were recruited on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of each month in the EDs in LA. We included ill-pediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years. Patients who needed transfer for a diagnostic study, with arrival mode not by ambulance, or with the impossibility of interviewing the transfer team were excluded from the study. A total of 389 patients were included in the study. The majority were males (57%) with a median age of 49 months (interquartile range, 10-116). Thirty-three percent (129) of transfers had the participation of a coordinating center; 97.1% (375) were carried out by road ambulance, and 84.3% (323) were interhospital transfers, with a mean distance traveled of 83.2 km (SD, 105 km). The main reason for transfer in 88.17% (343) was the need for a more complex health center. The main diagnosis was respiratory distress (71; 18.2%), acute abdomen (70; 18%), Traumatic Brain Injury (33; 8.48%), multiple trauma (32; 8.23%), septic shock (31; 7.9%), and COVID-19-related illness (19; 4.8%). A total of 296 (76.5%) patients had peripheral vascular access, and 171 (44%) patients had oxygen support with 49 (28.6%) having invasive ventilation; the most frequent monitoring method (67.8%) was pulse oximetry, and 83.4% (313) did not record adverse events. Regarding the transfer team, 88% (342) had no specialized personnel, and only 62.4% (243) had a physician on their teams. In LA, there is great variability in personnel training, equipment for pediatric transport, team composition, and characterization of critical care transport systems. Continued efforts to improve conditions in our countries may help reduce patient morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Preserving the mother's safety, sustaining the pregnancy state, and achieving the optimal fetal outcome are the major priorities when managing obstetric patients for non-obstetric surgery. Only necessary and urgent surgeries are carried out during pregnancy due to the effects of anesthesia and surgery on the fetus. Compound bowel obstruction (small and large bowel obstruction) is rare, especially during the third trimester of pregnancy. Besides this, the procedure (laparotomy) was done with awake opioid-based thoracic epidural anesthesia as the sole anesthesia. This case report of awake laparotomy for major abdominal surgery is the first of its kind with an excellent feto-maternal outcome. A 30-year-old African pregnant lady presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and vomiting for an 8-hour duration; associated with this, she had a history of blurred vision, lightheadedness, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, and constipation. Later, she was diagnosed with large bowel obstruction and underwent an emergency laparotomy, managed with a thoracic epidural sole anesthesia. A multidisciplinary team approach is greatly recommended to safeguard a sufficient standard of care for both the mother and fetus. The provision of regional anesthesia for patients with high risks in perioperative periods is crucial for a better postoperative outcome. We have confidence that thoracic epidural anesthesia can be used as another anesthetic option for major abdominal surgery in a resource-restricted setting for patients who are expected to have a significant risk of perioperative adverse events under general anesthesia."

We hypothesized that a direct-to-operating room (DOR) transfer program for patients with TAAD would reduce time to intervention. A DOR program was started at an urban tertiary care hospital in February 2020. We performed a retrospective study of adult patients undergoing treatment for TAAD before (n = 42) and after (n = 84) implementation of DOR. Expected mortality was calculated using the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection risk prediction model. Median time from acceptance of transfer from emergency physician to operating room arrival was 1.37 h (82 min) faster in DOR compared to pre-DOR (1.93 h vs 3.30 h, p < 0.001). Median time from arrival to operating room was 1.14 h (72 min) faster after DOR compared to pre-DOR (0.17 h vs 1.31 h, p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 16.2% in pre-DOR, with an observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio of 1.03 (p = 0.24) and 12.0% in the DOR group, with an O/E ratio of 0.59 (p < 0.001). Creation of a DOR program resulted in decreased time to intervention. This was associated with a decrease in observed-to-expected operative mortality. The transfer of patients with acute type A aortic dissection to centers with direct-to-OR programs may result in decreased time from diagnosis to surgery."

A retrospective analysis of patients (< 18 years old) undergoing an appendectomy across a multisite London hospital (Nov 2019-March 2022) was undertaken. Patient-related outcomes including length of hospital stay (LOS), days of antibacterial therapy (DOT), intra-operative microbiology and post-operative radiology reports were interrogated. 304 patients underwent an appendectomy during this period; 39.1% of patients had intraoperative samples cultured. Bacterial pathogens were found in 73/119 (61.3%) cases; the most common isolates being Escherichia coli (42.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.0%), milleri Streptococcus spp. (14.3%) and Bacteroides fragilis (5.9%). Polymicrobial infection was common (32/73). Isolation of Pseudomonas spp. from intra-operative sampling was associated with a greater LOS (7.0 vs. 5.0 days; p = 0.011) but nil effect on the incidence of postoperative collections. Presence of milleri Streptococcus spp. was associated with longer LOS (7.0 vs. 5.0 day; p = 0.007), DOT (12.0 vs. 8.5 day; p = 0.007) but had no observed outcome on postoperative collections (29.4% vs. 18.6%; p = 0.330). 48% of E. coli positive cultures were co-amoxiclav resistant and prolonged LOS compared to the non-resistant group (7.0 vs. 5.0 days; p = 0.040) but had no difference in post-operative collections (29.2% vs. 17.9%; p = 0.260). A high proportion of children with appendicitis have Pseudomonas spp. isolated, leading to a prolonged LOS. Evolving Enterobacterales resistance and the presence of Pseudomonas spp. necessitate extended antibacterial coverage for paediatric appendectomies with evidence of peritonitis."

Although such surgical emergencies were historically approached via open exploration, it is uncertain if there is a role for minimally invasive techniques. This study compares open vs laparoscopic colectomy techniques in the management of ischemic colitis. Using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, patients with ischemic colitis undergoing colectomy from 2005 to 2019 were compared. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. Additional outcomes of interest were procedure related readmission, procedure related reoperation, length of stay, surgical site infections (SSI), septic shock, and other complications. Outcomes of interest were compared using multivariate logistic regression. 7,928 patients had ischemic colitis with 7,209 undergoing open colectomy and 719 undergoing laparoscopic colectomy. The mortality rate was significantly lower using a laparoscopic approach compared to open (6.4% vs 26%, p=<0.001) and associated with a lower odd of mortality (OR 0.58; 95% CI [0.35, 0.95]). Procedure related reoperation was lower in the laparoscopic group (6.5% vs 11%, p<0.001), but multivariate analysis was not significant (OR 0.65; 95% CI [0.43,1]). Readmission rates were not statistically different (12% vs 10%, p = 0.2). Postoperative length of stay (7 vs 12 days, p=<0.001), septic shock (6.7% vs 27%, p=<0.001), and organ space SSI (3.2% vs 6.9%, p=<0.001) were significantly decreased using a laparoscopic approach. 30-day postoperative mortality was significantly lower using a laparoscopic. Patients that had a laparoscopic colectomy had shorter hospital stays. While patients that underwent laparoscopic procedures tended to be less sick, multivariate analysis showed decreased rates of sepsis and surgical site infections compared to open colectomies when correcting for these factors. Laparoscopic colectomy may be a better surgical approach for patients with ischemic colitis compared to open colectomy."

However, once the high-pressure water jet is accidentally fired at a human body, a large amount of water containing abrasive materials flows into the body in a short time, causing severely contaminated injuries (Dailiana et al., 2008 [1]). Water jet injury (WJI) should be treated as a surgical emergency, but the severity is often underestimated, and treatment is delayed because the wound often shows only small holes [1]. Previous reports have shown that the majority of WJI occur in the extremities [1] (Rodríguez et al., 2019 [2]). On the other hand, abdominal and thoracic WJIs have been rarely reported, with only two cases of thoracic WJI [2]. Here, a case of thoracic WJI in which the patient was brought to our hospital the day after injury and treatment intervention was delayed is presented, and points to consider in the diagnosis and treatment strategy for WJI to the chest are discussed."

These potentially fatal conditions originate from a shared cause, i.e. the defect of intraperitoneal ligaments resulting in a failure to withhold these organs at their anatomical position and alignment. This can come to attention in both childhood and/or adulthood, and the diagnosis calls for a high degree of suspicion and a failure to diagnose can culminate in death of both the organs, i.e. the spleen and stomach. We are presenting the case of a 20-year-old girl who underwent an emergency laparotomy for gastric volvulus and wandering spleen."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis places a substantial burden on healthcare systems, with acute appendicitis alone being the most common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide. Further characterisation of the disease burden in EU15+ countries may help optimise the distribution of healthcare resources. The aim of this observational study was to assess the trends in mortality, incidence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of appendicitis across European Union (EU) 15+ countries between the years 1990 and 2019, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A589 . Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs), age-standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) and DALYs data for appendicitis in males and females were extracted from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Temporal trends within the study period were analysed using Joinpoint regression analysis. The median ASMRs across EU15+ countries in 2019 were 0.08/100 000 and 0.13/100 000 for females and males, respectively. Between 1990 and 2019 the median percentage change in ASMR was -52.12% for females and -53.18% in males. The median ASIRs in 2019 for females and males were 251/100 000 and 278/100 000, respectively, with a median percentage change of +7.22% for females and +3.78% for males during the observation period. Decreasing trends in DALYs were observed over the 30-year study period, with median percentage changes of -23.57% and -33.81% for females and males, respectively, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A589 . Overall, a general trend of decreasing appendicitis ASMRs and DALYs was observed across EU15+ countries, despite small overall increases in appendicitis ASIRs, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A589 . Variations in both diagnostic and management strategies over the study period are likely contributory to the changing trends."

Hypertension is the leading cause but vascular malformations, infections and rare genetic conditions are also responsible. Twenty-three-year-old male with no prior comorbidities presented to emergency with sudden onset loss of consciousness and 1 episode of seizure. No history of intoxication or trauma was given. Glasgow Coma Scale at presentation was E1V2M2. CT scan head revealed bilateral basal ganglia haematoma along intraventricular haemorrhage. The patient was managed conservatively in the Neurosurgical Intensive care unit. Supportive management was provided. The patient's motor response was improving and a repeat CT scan showed a resolving haematoma. However, due to poor economic conditions, the patient party left against medical advice. Spontaneous bilateral basal ganglia haemorrhage is a rare surgical emergency with no clear consensus on a management approach. This case highlights the importance of undiagnosed hypertension in causing intracerebral haemorrhage in poor economic groups."

Button batteries and coins are the most common foreign body aspirations or ingestions among the paediatric population. An impacted button battery in the aerodigestive tract is a surgical emergency, requiring urgent removal to prevent complications arising from the corrosive nature of the button battery. We report two cases that were brought in with a history of foreign body ingestion. Both neck radiographs showed a double-ring opaque shadow. The first child had a button battery eroding into his oesophagus. The second case is an ideally impacted stack of coins of different sizes that mimic a double-ring shadow, better known as a halo sign, in an antero-posterior neck radiograph. These cases are unique in comparing ingested coins in alignment with a button battery and a radiological examination mimicking that of a button battery. In this report, we emphasize the importance of a thorough history, endoscopic examination, and the limitations of radiographs in the initial assessment of an ingested foreign body in terms of management and prediction of morbidity."

    "title": "Efficacy in Predicting Negative Appendectomy Rates in Operated Acute Appendicitis Patients Using the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis (RIPASA) Score Versus Modified Alvarado Score.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis is the commonest abdominal surgical emergency globally. The most accepted management of acute appendicitis is surgical, either open or laparoscopic appendectomy. Overlapping clinical presentations with many genitourinary and gynecological conditions lead to difficulty in accurate diagnosis, making negative appendectomies an unwanted reality. With the advancement in technology, there have been constant efforts to minimize negative appendectomy rates (NAR) using imaging modalities like USG of the abdomen and the gold-standard imaging test, the contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen. Due to the cost incurred and the lesser availability of such imaging modalities and needed expertise in resource-poor settings, various clinical scoring systems were devised to accurately diagnose acute appendicitis and thereby decrease NAR. We conducted our study to determine the NAR between the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Appendicitis score (RIPASA) and the modified Alvarado (MA) scoring methods. Methods A prospective observational analytical study was conducted, including 50 patients presenting to our hospital with acute appendicitis and who underwent emergency open appendectomy. The need to operate was decided by the treating surgeon. Patients were stratified by both scores; the pre-operative scores were noted and were later compared with the histopathological diagnosis. Results A total of 50 clinically diagnosed patients with acute appendicitis were evaluated utilizing the RIPASA and the MA scores. The NAR was 2% using the RIPASA score vs 10% with the MA score. The sensitivity was 94.11% vs 70.58% (p<0.0001), the specificity was 93.75% vs 68.75% (p<0.0001), the positive predictive value (PPV) of 96.96% vs 82.75% (p<0.001), the negative predictive value (NPV) of 88.23% vs 52.38% (p<0.001), and NAR of 2% vs 10% (p<0.0001) in the RIPASA vs MA scoring method, respectively. Conclusions RIPASA score is highly efficacious and statistically significant in diagnosing acute appendicitis with higher PPV at higher scores and higher NPV with lower scores leading to decreased NAR compared with MA score."

The majority of patients with small bowel obstruction can be relieved by early non-operative treatment and intestinal obstruction catheter. However, there are still many controversies about the window of observation, the time of emergency operation and the method of operation. In recent years, the basic and clinical research on small bowel obstruction has made further progress, but there is no authoritative reference in clinical practice, and there is no relevant consensus and guidelines to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction in China. Accordingly, on the initiative of the Chinese Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition and Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Branch of China International Health Care Promotion Exchange Association.

With Physiotherapists increasingly taking on first-contact and spinal triage roles, screening for CES must be as thorough and effective as possible. This study explores whether Physiotherapists are asking the correct questions, in the correct way and investigates their experiences when screening for this serious condition. Thirty physiotherapists working in a community musculoskeletal service were purposively sampled and participated in semi-structured interviews. Data was transcribed and thematically analysed. All participants routinely asked bladder, bowel function and saddle anaesthesia screening questions although only 9 routinely asked about sexual function. Whether questions are asked in the correct way has never been studied. Sufficient depth of questioning, using lay terminology and explicit language was achieved by two-thirds of participants. Less than half of the participants framed the questions before asking them and only 5 participants combined all four dimensions. Whilst most clinicians felt comfortable asking general CES questions, half reported feeling uncomfortable when asking about sexual function. Issues around; gender, culture and language were also highlighted. Four main themes emerged from this study; i) Physiotherapists ask the right questions but frequently omit sexual function questions, ii) mostly, Physiotherapists ask CES questions in a way that patients understand however, there needs to be improvement in framing the context of the questions, iii) Physiotherapists generally feel comfortable with CES screening but there is some awkwardness surrounding discussion of sexual function and iv) Physiotherapists perceive there to be barriers to effective CES screening caused by culture and language."

Hypercalcemia is most often associated with malignancy and primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy together account for most cases. Primary hyperparathyroidism manifests as hypercalcemia owing to the overproduction of parathyroid hormone. In most cases, primary hyperparathyroidism manifests due to a solitary parathyroid adenoma. Based on calcium levels, hypercalcemia can be classified as mild, moderate, and severe. Hypercalcemia typically presents with non-specific clinical features. Here, we present the case of a 38-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute abdominal pain and a tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds. He had chest radiography and blood tests initially. Chest radiography showed left-sided pneumoperitoneum, and the patient was suspected to have a perforated peptic ulcer due to hypercalcemia secondary to a parathyroid adenoma during the second wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The findings were confirmed by a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen, and the patient was treated with intravenous fluids for hypercalcemia and was managed conservatively for a sealed perforated peptic ulcer following discussion in the multi-disciplinary team meeting (MDT). The COVID-19 pandemic led to a long waiting list and delays in the timely management of patients requiring elective surgical intervention, such as parathyroidectomy.

Data on LBP in CRC patients from resource-limited countries are required to improve the management of this condition in these settings. Our study aimed to describe LBP amongst CRC patients in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This was a descriptive sub-analysis of LBP data from an ongoing CRC registry. This study explores free and contained perforations and describes LBP characteristics, surgical management, histological findings, overall survival, and CRC recurrence. Ninety-four out of 2523 CRC patients had LBP (3.7%). The median age was 53.0 years (interquartile range: 43.0-64.0). The male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. Thirty-three patients (35.1%) had a coexisting bowel obstruction. Tumor site perforations occurred in 87 patients (92.6%) and were mostly in the sigmoid colon (36.2%). Perforations were contained in 77 patients (81.9%). Eighty-nine patients (94.7%) underwent resection (elective resection: 76/89 patients, 85.4%). The post-operative inpatient mortality rate was 2.2%.

Between October 2017 and October 2021, two patients (N = 2) with CBS were treated at our institution in a multidisciplinary approach together with the Department of Vascular Surgery. Patients were characterized based on diagnoses, treatment procedures, and the subsequent postoperative course. Surgical emergency intervention was performed in both cases. The transition zone from the common carotid artery (CCA) to the internal carotid artery (ICA) was resected and reconstructed with a xenogic (case 1) or autogenic (case 2) interposition (end-to-end anastomosis). To allow reconstruction of the vascular defect, an additional autologous vein graft was anastomosed to the interposition graft in an end-to-side technique, allowing arterial anastomosis for a free microvascular flap without re-clamping of the ICA. Because of the intraoperative ICA reconstruction, none of the patients suffered a neurological deficit. The techniques presented in the form of two case reports allow for acute bleeding control, cerebral perfusion, and the creation of a vascular anastomosis option in the vessel-depleted neck."

As principais variáveis foram comorbidades e IMC pré e pós-operatório, ocorrência de complicações pós-operatórias severas, obstrução intestinal, úlcera marginal, fístula e morte em 30 dias, além da necessidade de idas à emergência e realização de tomografia computadorizada (CT) para investigação de abdome agudo. o grupo Estudo foi composto por 74.0% de mulheres, enquanto o Controle teve apenas 56.7%. O tempo médio de seguimento foi similar em ambos os grupos (5.48 x 6.09 anos, p=0.216). Não houve diferença estatisticamente significativa em relação à prevalência de diabetes entre os grupos nem entre a técnica cirúrgica empregada. Todos os óbitos ocorreram no grupo Estudo (IMC = 50kg/m2), com apenas pacientes submetidos ao BGYR. Não houve diferença significativa entre os grupos em relação à ocorrência de complicações pós-operatórias. Ao avaliar idas à emergência e necessidade de TC para investigar dor abdominal, também não foi observada difrença significativa entre os grupos. apesar do alto risco cirúrgico implicado em pacientes portadores de superobesidade, os benefícios relacionados à remissão de comorbidades ainda são significativos; contudo os resultados parecem ser inferiores aos pacientes com graus mais leves de obesidade."

    "abstract": "Uterine rupture is a life-threatening peripartum complication. Spontaneous uterine rupture in early pregnancy is very rare. The diagnosis of uterine rupture should be considered when a pregnant patient presents with an acute abdomen because its clinical signs in early pregnancy are non-specific and the differentiation with other acute abdominal emergencies is challenging. Here, we present a case of acute abdominal pain. The patient was a 14-week pregnant 39-year-old female (gravida 4, para 2+1) with a history of two lower-segment cesarean sections. Our preoperative diagnosis was either heterotopic pregnancy or acute abdomen. Emergency laparotomy confirmed the presence of a spontaneous uterine rupture."

    "abstract": "A rare disorder called ovarian torsion (OT) during pregnancy can harm both the mother and the fetus. Predisposing variables for the condition include enlarged ovaries, free mobility, and a long pedicle, despite the fact that its genesis is not entirely understood. When ovarian stimulation is used to treat infertility, the disease's incidence rises. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound are examples of diagnostic imaging modalities (MRI). A 26-year-old woman with a 33-week pregnancy presented to our emergency department with acute, severe left groin pain. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable except for leukocytosis (18.800/μL) with neutrophil shift. A radiologist used ultrasound to examine the abdomen and pelvis, and the results revealed a bulk enlargement of the left adnexa. The patient underwent a non-enhanced MRI in order to obtain a conclusive diagnosis, which revealed a massive enlargement and torsion of the left ovary with large areas of necrosis. The patient underwent a successful laparoscopic adnexectomy with preservation of the pregnancy. She delivered a healthy baby and had an uneventful follow up period. The etiology of OT is largely unknown. Any tendency to rotate the infundibulopelvic and utero-ovarian ligaments should be considered as a possible etiology. The prevalence of OT among pregnant women is underreported and determined by small limited studies. Ovarian torsion should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with suspected acute abdomen in advanced stages of pregnancy. In addition, MRI should be used as an alternative diagnostic modality in patients with normal sonographic findings."

    "abstract": "Regardless of the cause, bowel obstruction is described as the absence of abnormal transit of intestinal contents. It may involve only the small intestine, the large intestine, or both. It might be brought on by a bodily impediment or widespread modifications to the metabolism, electrolyte balance, or neuroregulatory systems. In the field of general surgery, there are several well-known causes that can vary between developing and developed nations. In this case report, we describe a case of acute small bowel obstruction secondary to ileo-ileal knotting in 35 years old female patient with a complaint of crampy abdominal pain of 7 hour duration. She had associated frequent vomiting of ingested matter followed by bilious matter. She had also mild abdominal distention. She had history of caesarian section delivery 3 times the last time was 4 months back. Ileoileal knotting is a unique and rare clinical entity in which a loop of proximal ileum wrap around the distal part of ileum. The presentation includes abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, and obstipation. The majority of cases require resection and anastomosis or exteriorization of the affected segment, and management entails a high index of suspicion and emergent investigation. We demonstrate an instance of ileo-ileal knotting to highlight the fact that it is an unusual intraoperative finding and, given the rarity of cases, should be taken into account in the alternative diagnosis of patients exhibiting SBO signs and symptoms."

Herein, we report a gynaecological case of a twisted ovarian cyst in an 11-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset generalised abdominal pain. Multiple strong analgesics were prescribed, and pain-controlled analgesia was then started. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a left adnexal mass, and abdominal computed tomography showed a non-enhancing soft tissue tumour with multiple cystic components in the pouch of Douglas. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, which revealed a gangrenous left ovarian mass measuring 9x5 cm that was twisted five times. Histopathology showed extensive haemorrhagic infarction with no remnant of viable tissue, consistent with a twisted ovary. It was challenging to determine the origin of the pain in this patient, as thorough examination could not be performed because she was in severe pain. Abdominal ultrasound helps guide diagnosis, as a gynaecological cause is rare in premenarchal children. A vigilant assessment is important to avoid delays in diagnosis and emergency intervention."

The exact mechanism causing the spontaneous rupture of a tumor is not clearly understood although some theories are proposed. CT scan is the most important investigation in this emergency. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose rupture in a known case of pheochromocytoma presenting with acute abdomen and shock. Ruptured pheochromocytoma is a rare emergency, and timely and precise diagnosis and initial primary nonsurgical approach followed by elective surgical resection are to be practiced whenever possible. When emergency exploration is imminent, a multi-specialty team should be prepared with a well-equipped ICU, rapid hemodynamic monitoring and corrections, massive blood transfusion protocol, and timely resuscitation."

There is a variety of scoring systems and radiological investigations that have been used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Hence, the aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic approach in patients with suspected appendicitis in a tertiary care hospital, focusing on the radiological burden. This is a cross-sectional study reviewing the electronic and manual medical records of all adult patients admitted with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis between January 2018 and December 2018 in Salmaniya Medical Complex, Manama, Bahrain. A review of the method of diagnosis (clinical, ultrasound, computed tomography, or others) was done, with a comparison to histopathological results in those that underwent surgical intervention to determine sensitivity and specificity. In the study period, 488 patients were admitted with acute appendicitis; out of these, 461 underwent surgical intervention. A total of 66 CT scans and 148 ultrasounds were conducted for these patients, out of which 57% of ultrasounds and 86% of CT scans accurately diagnosed acute appendicitis based on histopathological diagnosis, resulting in a sensitivity of 65% and 92%, respectively, and a specificity of 56% and 25%, respectively. The most accurate method of diagnosis of acute appendicitis (highest sensitivity) is CT scanning. However, a prospective study with a detailed assessment of complications of appendicitis is recommended."

Retrospective evaluation of medical record and hospital trauma registry data on feline trauma cases. University teaching hospital. Two hundred and fifty-one cats presenting for traumatic injury between May 2017 and July 2020. None. Demographics and outcomes were compared for cats undergoing surgical intervention in an OR (12%, 31/251) or an ER (23%, 58/251) setting and feline trauma patients without surgical intervention (65%, 162/251). Between the 2 surgical groups, 99% survived to discharge compared to 73.5% of the nonsurgical group (P < 0.0001). For the OR surgical cohort, electronic medical records were reviewed to determine the specialty surgery service involved, time to and duration of anesthesia and surgery, and visit cost. The most common surgery services involved were orthopedics (41%, 12/29) and dentistry (38%, 11/29), and the most common surgeries performed were mandibular fracture stabilization (8/29) and internal fixation for long bone fractures (8/29). The ER surgical group had a significantly lower Animal Trauma Triage score than the OR group (P < 0.0001), but a significant difference was not found between OR surgical and nonsurgical groups (P = 0.0553). No difference in modified Glasgow Coma Scale score was found between any groups. Surgical intervention in feline trauma patients appears to be associated with higher survival rates, but no difference in mortality was found across surgery services. OR surgical intervention, in particular, orthopedic surgery, was associated with increased length of hospitalization, increased cost, and increased use of blood products."

Type A aortic dissection can rarely manifest as upper limb malperfusion. This is regarding a patient who presented with intermittent malperfusion of the bilateral upper limbs and was initially managed as acute limb ischemia. An attempt of embolectomy didn't yield any clots. Urgent imaging with computed tomography angiogram of bilateral upper limbs revealed type A aortic dissection (TAAD). TAAD is a surgical emergency which can rarely manifest as intermittent malperfusion of upper limbs. This could be explained by the dissection flap's dynamic obstruction of the right brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery. In patients with a discrepancy in pulse between both limbs or intermittent ischemia of limbs, aortic dissection should be considered a differential diagnosis."

He was unvaccinated against COVID-19 and tested positive for COVID-19 five days prior. He developed respiratory failure requiring intubation, and was treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab for COVID-19 pneumonia. On hospital day 2, he was hypotensive with new rapidly evolving erythematous lesions with crepitus of his lower extremities suspicious for necrotizing fasciitis. He underwent wide excision and debridement with significant hemodynamic improvements. H. flu co-infection was identified from blood cultures. Aberrant cells with 94 % lymphocytes were noted and suggested chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that was not previously known. He developed progressive lesions globally, concerning for purpura fulminans with clinical disseminated intravascular coagulation and neurological decline ultimately leading to withdrawal of care. COVID-19 infection is often associated with concomitant opportunistic infections. Our patient was also immunocompromised by CLL, diabetes, chronic steroids, and initial appropriate COVID-19 treatments. Despite appropriate treatments, he could not overcome his medical comorbidities and multiple infections. Necrotizing fasciitis caused by H. flu is rare, and we present the first case as a co-infection in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia.

    "abstract": "Timely access to the operating room for emergency general surgery (EGS) indications remains a challenge across the globe, largely driven by operating room availability and staffing constraints. The \"timing in acute care surgery\" (TACS) classification was previously published to introduce a new tool to triage the timely and appropriate access of EGS patients to the operating room. However, the clinical and operational effectiveness of the TACS classification has not been investigated in subsequent validation studies. This study aimed to improve the TACS classification and provide further consensus around the appropriate use of the new TACS classification through a standardized Delphi approach with international experts. This is a validation study of the new TACS by a selected international panel of experts using the Delphi method. The TACS questionnaire was designed as a web-based survey. The consensus agreement level was established to be ≥ 75%. The collective consensus agreement was defined as the sum of the percentage of the highest Likert scale levels (4-5) out of all participants. Surgical emergency diseases and correlated clinical scenarios were defined for each of the proposed classes. Subsequent rounds were carried out until a definitive level of consensus was reached. Frequencies and percentages were calculated to determine the degree of agreement for each surgical disease. Four polling rounds were carried out. The new TACS classification provides 6 colour-code classes correlated to a precise timing to surgery, defined scenarios and surgical condition. The WHITE colour-code class was introduced to rapidly (within a week) reschedule cancelled or postponed surgical procedures. Haemodynamic stability is the main tool to stratify patients for immediate surgery or not in the presence of sepsis/septic shock. Fifty-one surgical diseases were included in the different colour-code classes of priority. The new TACS classification is a comprehensive, simple, clear and reproducible triage system which can be used to assess the severity of the patient and the surgical disease, to reduce the time to access to the operating room, and to manage the emergency surgical patients within a \"safe\" timeframe. By including well-defined surgical diseases in the different colour-code classes of priority, validated through a Delphi consensus, the new TACS improves communication among surgeons, between surgeons and anaesthesiologists and decreases conflicts and waste and waiting time in accessing the operating room for emergency surgical patients."

    "abstract": "To identify prognostic factors associated with 90-day mortality in patients with oesophageal perforation (OP), and characterize the specific timeline from presentation to intervention, and its relation to mortality. OP is a rare gastro-intestinal surgical emergency with a high mortality rate. However, there is no updated evidence on its outcomes in the context of centralized esophago-gastric services; updated consensus guidelines; and novel non-surgical treatment strategies. A multi-center, prospective cohort study involving eight high-volume esophago-gastric centers (January 2016 to December 2020) was undertaken. The primary outcome measure was 90-day mortality. Secondary measures included length of hospital and ICU stay, and complications requiring re-intervention or re-admission. Mortality model training was performed using random forest, support-vector machines, and logistic regression with and without elastic net regularisation. Chronological analysis was performed by examining each patient's journey timepoint with reference to symptom onset. The mortality rate for 369 patients included was 18.9%. Patients treated conservatively, endoscopically, surgically, or combined approaches had mortality rates of 24.1%, 23.7%, 8.7%, and 18.2%, respectively. The predictive variables for mortality were Charlson comorbidity index, haemoglobin count, leucocyte count, creatinine levels, cause of perforation, presence of cancer, hospital transfer, CT findings, whether a contrast swallow was performed, and intervention type. Stepwise interval model showed that time to diagnosis was the most significant contributor to mortality. Non-surgical strategies have better outcomes and may be preferred in selected cohorts to manage perforations. Outcomes can be significantly improved through better risk-stratification based on afore-mentioned modifiable risk factors."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis remains the most common general surgical emergency seen in most hospitals and the most common cause of acute abdomen requiring surgical intervention. The aim was to study the intraoperative features and postoperative outcomes of appendicular perforation in adults. First, to study the incidence, clinical presentation, and complications of perforated appendicitis in a tertiary care hospital. Second, to study morbidity and mortality in an operated case of perforated appendicitis. This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in a government setup from August 2017 to July 2019. Data were collected from patients (N=126) who had an intraoperative finding of perforated appendicitis. The inclusion criteria are as follows: patients over the age of 12 with a perforated appendix, as well as any patients with intraoperative findings like perforated appendicitis, gangrenous perforated appendicitis, or a disintegrated appendix. The exclusion criteria are as follows: all patients with appendicitis below 12 years of age with perforated appendicitis; all patients with appendicitis with intraoperative findings of acute nonperforated appendicitis; and all patients with intraoperative findings of an appendicular lump or mass. Perforation was found in 13.8% of the cases of acute appendicitis in this study. With a mean age of 32.5 years, the most common age of presentation in perforated appendicitis was 21-30 years. The most prevalent presenting symptom in all patients (100%) was abdominal pain, followed by vomiting (64.3%) and fever (38.9%). Patients with perforated appendicitis had a 72.2% complication rate. Peritoneal pollution of more than 150 ml was linked to a 100% increase in morbidity and mortality (54.5%). The mean duration of the hospital stay in patients with a perforated appendix was 7.28±5 days. Surgical site infection (42%) was the most common early complication, followed by wound dehiscence (16.6%), intestinal obstruction (1.6%), and faecal fistula (1.6%). The most common late complications were intestinal obstruction (2.4%), intra-abdominal abscess (1.6%), and incisional hernia (1.6%). The mortality rate in patients with perforated appendicitis was 4.8%. To conclude, prehospital delay was an important factor contributing to appendicular perforation and leading to adverse outcomes. A higher rate of morbidity and prolonged duration of hospital stay were seen in patients with delayed presentation, with features of generalised peritonitis and perforation of the base of the appendix. Delayed presentations in as elderly population with underlying co-morbid conditions associated with severe peritoneal contamination were associated with higher mortality (26%) in perforated appendicitis. Conventional surgery and open procedures remain the preferred approach in a government setup like ours where laparoscopy may not be available during odd hours. Since this study was done over a short duration, certain long-term outcomes could not be assessed. Hence, there is still a need for further studies."

A complication of a hydatid cyst of the liver is its rupture, either traumatic or spontaneously. A 19-year-old male presented with an acute abdomen for 12 h. After clinical assessment, contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a rupture of the anterior wall of the hepatic hydatid cyst with intra-abdominal and pelvic dissemination. Exploratory laparotomy was performed with the evacuation of the daughter cyst and peritoneal lavage. The patient recovered well and was discharged with albendazole therapy. Hydatid cyst rupture is a rare but serious complication. Computed tomography has high sensitivity in demonstrating cyst rupture. The patient underwent laparotomy, where disseminated cysts were evacuated, and the anterior wall of the cyst was deroofed, along with the removal of a ruptured laminated membrane. Emergency surgery plus albendazole therapy are recommended protocols for cases like ours. A patient from an endemic region with acute presentation of right upper quadrant pain can have spontaneously ruptured hydatidosis as a differential diagnosis. Intraperitoneal rupture and dissemination of hydatid cysts of the liver can be life-threatening if intervention is delayed. Immediate surgery is life-saving and prevents complications."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a global disease with an incidence of 7-12% in the population of the USA and Europe but is low and rising in the developing world. It is the most common acute general surgical emergency, but as no investigation is accurate, the diagnosis has to rely on clinical symptoms and signs and, thus, frequently misdiagnosed. The aim of the study was to debate the arguments for managing appendicitis (operative, nonoperative, or both). Electronic searches of the MEDLINE (PubMed) database, Cochrane Library, and Science Citation Index were performed to identify original published studies on appendicitis and the pre-COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) and post-COVID-19 management. Relevant articles were searched from relevant chapters in specialized texts, and all have been included. There are indications for operative (surgery), nonoperative (antibiotics), or both in the management of acute appendicitis. Although laparoscopic appendicectomy is becoming the gold standard of treatment, knowledge of the pros and cons of this approach versus the open approach is important. The controversy in the management of the appendix mass/abscess between an expedient appendicectomy or a combination of conservative management (antibiotics) and interval appendicectomy remains. Laparoscopic appendicectomy is becoming the gold standard for the treatment of appendicitis. However, the advantages of the innovations in minimally invasive and endoscopic surgery are unlikely to render formal open appendicectomy obsolete. Nonoperative management with antibiotics may suffice in selected cases with uncomplicated appendicitis. It is imperative that patients are counseled appropriately if primary antibiotic treatment is to be routinely offered as first-line therapy."

A 25-year-old Pakistani male presented to a surgical emergency with a two-hour history of generalized abdominal pain after blunt abdominal trauma. An exploratory laparotomy was carried out due to the deranged hemodynamic parameters and free fluid in the abdominopelvic cavity, revealing a 35 centimeters long MD with a bleeding vessel on its tip. Diverticulectomy with the repair of a small intestinal defect was performed after the evacuation of 2.5 liters of clotted blood. Histologic evaluation revealed ectopic gastric tissue. He had an uneventful post-operative stay and was discharged home. The current English scientific literature has adequate case reports documenting the complications of perforation, intestinal obstruction, and diverticulitis of Meckel's Diverticulum (MD) of normal length. However, this case report highlights the significance of an MD with an abnormal length which put the patient's life at risk of death in the setting of normal intra-operative anatomy of all other abdominal organs."

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a medical and surgical emergency that describes the body's systemic immunological response to an infectious process that can lead to end-stage organ dysfunction and death. Various clinical and biochemical parameters serve as indicators of organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis. Most familiar among them are the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Mortality Prediction Score (MPM), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS). A comparative study of APACHE II and SOFA scores was done at the time of admission in a total of 72 patients with sepsis and compared with the mean SOFA score. In our study, the SOFA score was measured serially and the mean SOFA score was calculated. All patients were selected according to the definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3). The ROC curve, the sensitivity, and the specificity were calculated to analyze the diagnostic value of SOFA, APACHE II, and the mean SOFA score. For all statistical tests, a \"p-value\" less than 0.05 was taken to indicate a significant difference. Our study showed that the mean SOFA score had a sensitivity of 93.65 and a specificity of 100, and on comparing the AUC of mean SOFA with APACHE II (Day 1) and SOFA (Day 1) - we got the P-value 0.0066 and 0.0008, which shows a statistically significant difference. So, we can say that the mean SOFA score is better than D1 (day 1 of admission) APACHE II & SOFA scores in predicting mortality in surgical patients with sepsis. APACHE II and SOFA scores are equally effective in assessing mortality in surgical patients with sepsis at the time of admission. However, if we take serial measurements of SOFA scores and calculate the mean SOFA score it becomes a very useful tool for predicting mortality."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common surgical emergency. Recent evidence suggests that serum procalcitonin (PCT) is superior to leukocytosis and serum C-reactive protein in the diagnosis and severity stratification of acute infections. This review evaluates the role of PCT in AC diagnosis, severity stratification, and management. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception till 21 August 2022 for studies reporting the role of PCT in AC. A qualitative analysis of the existing literature was conducted. Results: Five articles, including 688 patients, were included. PCT ≤ 0.52 ng/mL had fair discriminative ability (Area under the curve (AUC) 0.721, p < 0.001) to differentiate Grade 1 from Grade 2-3 AC, and PCT > 0.8 ng/mL had good discriminatory ability to differentiate Grade 3 from 1-2 AC (AUC 0.813, p < 0.001). PCT cut-off ≥ 1.50 ng/mL predicted difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomy (sensitivity 91.3%, specificity 76.8%). The incidence of open conversion was higher with PCT ≥ 1 ng/mL (32.4% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.013). A PCT value of >0.09 ng/mL could predict major complications (defined as open conversion, mechanical ventilation, and death). Conclusions: Current evidence is plagued by the heterogeneity of small sample studies. Though PCT has some role in assessing severity and predicting difficult cholecystectomy, and postoperative complications in AC patients, more evidence is necessary to validate its use."

Registry data have noted several sex-specific differences in presentation with TAAAD which may account for the differences in men and women undergoing surgery for this condition. A retrospective review of data from three departments of cardiac surgery (Centre Cardiologique du Nord, Henri-Mondor University Hospital, San Martino University Hospital, Genoa) between January 2005 and 31 December 2021 was conducted. Confounders were adjusted using doubly robust regression models, a combination of regression models with inverse probability treatment weighting by propensity score. 633 patients were included in the study, of which 192 (30.3%) were women. Women were significantly older with reduced haemoglobin levels and pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate compared to men. Male patients were more likely to undergo aortic root replacement and partial or total arch repair. Operative mortality (OR 0.745, 95% CI: 0.491-1.130) and early postoperative neurological complication results were comparable between the groups. The adjusted survival curves using IPTW by propensity score confirmed the absence of a significant impact of gender on long-term survival (HR 0.883, 95% CI 0.561-1.198). In a subgroup analysis of women, preoperative levels of arterial lactate (OR 1.468, 95% CI: 1.133-1.901) and mesenteric ischemia after surgery (OR 32.742, 95% CI: 3.361-319.017) were significantly associated with increased operative mortality. The advancing age of female patients alongside raised preoperative level of arterial lactate may account for the increasing preponderance among surgeons to perform more conservative surgery compared to their younger male counterparts although postoperative survival was similar between the groups."

    "abstract": "Acute gastrointestinal emergencies are one of the most common presentations to the emergency department. If the main symptom is acute abdominal pain, this is referred to as \"acute abdomen\". An acute abdomen demands urgent attention and treatment and can be caused by different pathologies (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, acute pancreatitis, diverticulitis). Hepatic emergencies include acute liver failure and acute-on-chronic liver failure. Due to the large number of possible differential diagnoses with variable clinical symptoms, rapid diagnosis of the underlying etiology of gastrointestinal and liver emergencies is a major challenge in daily clinical practice. A structured approach and prompt initiation of adequate diagnostic and treatment measures are essential in order to reduce mortality. Akute gastrointestinale Notfälle zählen zu den häufigsten Vorstellungsgründen in der Notaufnahme. Liegt als Hauptsymptom ein akuter Abdominalschmerz vor, wird dies klinisch als „akutes Abdomen“ bezeichnet, dem viele mögliche Ursachen (z. B. gastroduodenale Ulkuskrankheit, akute Pankreatitis, Divertikulitis) zugrunde liegen können. Hepatologische Notfälle umfassen das akute Leberversagen und das akut-auf-chronische Leberversagen. Aufgrund der Vielzahl möglicher Differenzialdiagnosen mit variabler klinischer Begleitsymptomatik stellt eine rasche Diagnosestellung der zugrunde liegenden Ätiologie gastrointestinaler sowie hepatologischer Notfälle im klinischen Alltag oftmals eine große Herausforderung dar und erfordert ein strukturiertes Vorgehen sowie die umgehende Einleitung adäquater Therapiemaßnahmen, um das Mortalitätsrisiko der Betroffenen zu reduzieren."

    "abstract": "Despite advances in modern medicine, traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are still a major medical problem. Early diagnosis of TBI is crucial for clinical decision-making and prognosis. This study aims to compare the predictive value of Helsinki, Rotterdam, and Stockholm CT scores in predicting the 6-month outcomes in blunt TBI patients. This cohort study was conducted on blunt TBI patients of 15 years or older. All of them were admitted to the surgical emergency department of Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Kashan, Iran from 2020 to 2021 and had abnormal trauma-related findings on brain CT images. The patients' demographic data such as age, gender, history of comorbid conditions, mechanism of trauma, Glasgow coma scale, CT images, length of hospital stay, and surgical procedures were recorded. The Helsinki, Rotterdam, and Stockholm CT scores were simultaneously determined according to the existing guidelines. The included patients' 6-month outcome was determined using the Glasgow outcome scale extended. M Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 16.0. Sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive predictive value and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were calculated for each test. The Kappa agreement coefficient and Kuder Richardson-20 were used to compare the scoring systems. Altogether 171 TBI patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with the mean age of (44.9 ± 20.2) years. Most patients were male (80.7%), had traffic related injuries (83.1%) and mild TBIs (64.3%). Patients with lower Glasgow coma scale had higher Helsinki, Rotterdam, and Stockholm CT scores and lower Glasgow outcome scale extended scores. Among all the scoring systems, the Helsinki and Stockholm scores showed the highest agreement in predicting patients' outcomes (kappa = 0.657, p < 0.001). The Rotterdam scoring system had the highest sensitivity (90.1%) in predicting death of TBI patients, whereas the Helsinki scoring system had the highest sensitivity (89.8%) in predicting the 6-month outcome in TBI patients. The Rotterdam scoring system was superior in predicting death in TBI patients, whereas the Helsinki scoring system was more sensitive in predicting the 6-month outcome."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is the result of spermatic cord twisting which can lead to significant ischemia, making it a time-sensitive surgical emergency. General surgeons in rural centers may lack the resources to adequately evaluate the viability of the affected testicle. Indocyanine green fluorescence (IGF) has been increasingly used to assess vascular perfusion in general surgery cases. In this case report, we show the use of IGF in a rural setting to assess testicular viability in TT. A 17-year-old male was transferred to our rural regional hospital emergency department for sudden and persistent right scrotal pain. The onset of symptoms was approximately 52 h at presentation. TT was diagnosed with a doppler ultrasound by a radiologist. Urgent detorsion surgery was performed. Intraoperative assessment of viability was unclear after the usual means and IGF helped confirm the absence of testicle vascularization and the need for orchiectomy. General surgeons in rural communities are called to manage TT with limited resources and experience. IGF is widely used in general surgery and urology. Animal studies and two case reports show potential benefits of IGF in TT. In our patient, IGF was useful to confirm without a doubt that the right testicle was ischemic and non-viable. In a rural setting with limited access to radiology and distant urology coverage, IGF is an excellent resource to determine intraoperative blood flow in TT with uncertain viability."

    "abstract": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a well-acknowledged complication after hospitalization for injury or surgical emergency. The contribution to the literature on this topic by Dr Timothy Fabian and the Memphis group at the Elvis Presley Trauma Center resulted in the contemporary recognition that the diagnosis and management of pneumonia is an essential component of surgical critical care. During three decades, the Memphis group, under Dr Fabian's leadership, performed numerous clinical studies that led to the publication of over 40 articles concerning the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumonia after injury. The purpose of this review is to survey the consecutive studies from Memphis specifically that led to the development of a clinical pathway that has stood the test of time. Examination of the research output during this period provides a case study in how bedside clinical research can inform clinical practice and is a model for applied science in the intensive care unit."

The remaining 20% are performed at Children's Health Ireland (CHI) centres. Occasionally patients are transferred from Non-Specialist Paediatric Surgical Centres (NSPSC) for specialised pre-operative or post-operative care. To assess the rates of and characterise appendicitis-related referrals to CHI at Crumlin from NSPSC. A retrospective review of all appendicitis-related transfers to CHI at Crumlin between January 2020 and December 2021 was performed. Data relating to indications for transfer, referring hospital level, patient demographics, management, type of surgery, length of stay (LOS), and radiological studies were collected and analysed. Seventy-two patients were transferred to CHI at Crumlin over the 2-year period. A total of 60.9% were male, mean age 9 ± 4.3 years, mean LOS 6.0 ± 2.2 days (range 1-30 days). Nineteen percent were under 5 years of age. Seventy-three percent were transferred from level 4 centres. Ninety-seven percent were transferred pre-operatively, 25% of those transferred pre-operatively had imaging in CHI confirming appendicitis. Fifty-five percent (40/72) of patients had pre-operative imaging performed. A total of 37.5% (15/40) confirmed complicated appendicitis. Twenty percent (8/40) underwent both ultrasound and computerised tomography (CT) at the referring centre. A total of 2.7% (2/72) were transferred with known co-morbidities. Ninety-two percent (66/72) underwent appendicectomy. Eight percent (6/72) were managed non-operatively (NOM) - 2 failed NOM, 2 underwent interval appendicectomy. Of those managed operatively, 76% (50/66) underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy, and 24% (16/66) were performed open. The majority of paediatric appendicectomies are performed at Non-Specialist Paediatric Surgical Centres. It is vital to maintain this working relationship so that specialist paediatric centres are available to provide care to complex paediatric patients."

    "abstract": "Background Acute abdomen is often complicated by intra-abdominal infection requiring antibiotic therapy. Danish regional antibiotic guidelines emphasize the restricted use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cephalosporins. In this study, we aimed to evaluate antibiotic practices in relation to hospitalized patients with acute abdomen. Methodology This retrospective quality assurance study was conducted among patients admitted to the surgical emergency department at the North Denmark Regional Hospital during a four-month observation period. Data were extracted from electronic patient journals and entered in the Research Electronic Data Capture data management system for further analytical work. Results Of 331 patients, 174 (53%) were treated with antibiotics, of whom 98 (56%) had been treated with cephalosporin, 47 (27%) with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, 22 (13%) with piperacillin/tazobactam, and seven (4%) with ciprofloxacin. Use of a cephalosporin-based antibiotic regimen was significantly more common in patients with acute appendicitis (75%) compared to other diagnostic groups, such as acute cholecystitis (57%), incarcerated hernia with strangulation (56%), acute pancreatitis (50%), and acute diverticulitis (30%). However, patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (53%) were significantly more often treated with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, whereas patients with complicated diverticulitis Hinchey stage 3-4 were significantly more often treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. In addition, as the severity of acute cholecystitis increased, it was more frequently treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. Conclusions The study revealed that cephalosporins are frequently used in patients hospitalized with acute abdomen. This finding conflicts with current regional antibiotic guidelines. Reinforcement of the guidelines is required as an essential measure against the development of antibiotic resistance associated with the use of cephalosporins."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract; occurring most often in the stomach and to a lesser extent in the jejunum. The majority of the tumors express activating mutations in either c-KIT or PDGFRA tyrosine kinases, which respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Jejunal GIST is considered to be extremely rare and challenging to diagnose due to its non-specific presentation. As a result, patients usually present at an advance stage of the disease, making the prognosis poor and difficult to manage. In the present study, we report a 50-year-old female who was diagnosed with metastatic jejunal GIST. She was commenced on Imatinib (TKI) and shortly after she presented to the emergency department with an acute abdomen. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed ischemic changes in the jejunal loops and pneumoperitoneum. The patient required emergency laparotomy due to perforated GIST, and creation of pericardial window due to hemodynamic instability possibly secondary TKI-related isolated pericardial effusion. Jejunal GIST is rare and usually presents as emergency due to obstruction, hemorrhage or rarely perforation. Although, systemic therapy with TKI is the principal treatment for advance disease, Jejunal GIST should be removed surgically. It is surgically challenging due to the anatomical complexity of the tumor. Surgeons treating such patients must be cautious for TKI side effects."

    "abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) type 2 is characterized by the presence of Addison's disease (AD) along with autoimmune thyroid disease and/or type 1 diabetes. APS type 2 is known as Schmidt's syndrome when autoimmune adrenal insufficiency is associated with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. We report a very rare case of a 28-year-old female patient who had Schmidt's syndrome revealed by a thyroid storm (TS) concomitant with an acute adrenal crisis. The onset of AD resulted in a surgical emergency. The patient presented with cardiogenic shock and an acute abdomen. The precipitation factor was Hashitoxicosis presented as TS. This life-threatening condition was successfully reversed with aggressive medical therapy based on antithyroid drugs and intravenous glucocorticoids. This hyperthyroid phase lasted for a period of 8 months. The patient eventually developed hypothyroidism, suggesting that Hashimoto's thyroiditis was the most likely diagnosis. She was started on levothyroxine replacement therapy and remained euthyroid on levothyroxine. The case we describe had several diagnostic pitfalls that are discussed both at the start as well as during the evolution. Autoimmune diseases can appear concomitantly or succeed each other over time. The clinician must be vigilant to detect these diseases in time in order to avoid a misdiagnosis of a life-threatening emergency such as adrenal insufficiency or thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is an uncommon but life-threatening manifestation of hyperthyroidism. Diagnosis is dependent on clinical symptoms, and no specific laboratory tests are available. Glucocorticoids should be used in the treatment of thyroid storm because they have an inhibitory effect on peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. In patients who have severe thyrotoxicosis, especially in conjunction with hypotension, treatment with glucocorticoids has become standard practice because of the possibility of relative adrenal insufficiency or the possibility of undiagnosed Addison's disease. The differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism can be challenging. Graves' disease can be discussed in view of the severity of the clinical presentation and the prolonged duration of the hyperthyroid phase. Hashitoxicosis is the initial hyperthyroid phase in chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. The hyperthyroid phase is always followed by definitive resolution, with persistent euthyroidism and no hyperthyroid relapses. Synthetic antithyroid drugs may be prescribed during the hyperthyroid phase of Hashimoto thyroiditis if the clinical presentation is severe and the duration of the hyperthyroid phase is prolonged."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous esophageal perforation is a challenging surgical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality, and timely primary repair carries good outcomes. However, direct repair for a delayed spontaneous esophageal perforation is not always feasible and is associated with high mortality. Esophageal stenting can provide therapeutic benefits in the management of esophageal perforations. In this study, we review our experience with placing esophageal stents in combination with minimally-invasive surgical drainage to treat delayed spontaneous esophageal perforations. We retrospectively analyzed patients with delayed spontaneous esophageal perforations between September 2018 and March 2021. All patients were treated using a hybrid approach, including esophageal stenting across the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) to reduce continued contamination, gastric decompression with extraluminal sutures to prevent stent migration, early enteral nutrition, and aggressive minimally-invasive thoracoscopic debridement and drainage of infected material. There were 5 patients with delayed spontaneous esophageal perforation treated with this hybrid approach. The mean duration between symptoms and diagnosis was 5 days, and the interval between symptoms and esophageal stent insertion was 7 days. The median time to oral nutrition and to esophageal stent removal was 43 and 66 days. There was no stent migration or hospital mortality. Three patients (60%) had postoperative complications. All patients were successfully resumed on oral nutrition with esophageal preservation. A hybrid approach combining endoscopic esophageal stent placement with extraluminal sutures to prevent stent migration, thoracoscopic decortication with chest tube drainage, gastric decompression, and jejunostomy tube placement for early nutrition was feasible and effective in the treatment of delayed spontaneous esophageal perforations. This technique offers a less invasive treatment approach for a challenging clinical problem which has traditionally carried a high rate of morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Avulsion tuberosity fracture of the calcaneus is relatively unusual and occurs more frequently in elderly osteoporotic patients. Direct trauma to the heel is a rare cause in young individuals. Failure to perform early open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) potentially leads to soft-tissue complications due to pressure necrosis of the overlying skin. A 29-year-old male patient experienced left heel pain with swelling after the assault as he was hit by an iron rod 8 days prior. Radiographs revealed a Beavis Type 2 calcaneal avulsion fracture. An open reduction with two corticocancellous (CC) screw fixation was intended for the fracture. The avulsed bone fragment was small causing difficulty in reduction. The result of closed reduction in such a scenario is not promising and usually requires ORIF. We performed a modified surgical procedure of CC screw fixation in which one screw was passed perpendicular to the fracture plane for reduction of the fracture and another screw was passed obliquely to nullify Achilles forces. We believe that this technique of fracture management improves patient outcome and early mobilization."

We describe a case of a 1-year-old girl who presented with haematemesis and an oesophageal injury, secondary to button battery ingestion. Sagittal reconstruction of the CT chest demonstrated a suspicious area of vertebral erosion in the cervicothoracic spine which prompted a further evaluation with MRI demonstrating spondylodiscitis of C7-T2 with vertebral erosion and collapse. The child was successfully treated with long course of antibiotics. We wish to highlight the importance of clinical and radiological spinal assessment in children with button battery ingestion to avoid delayed diagnosis and complications of spinal osteomyelitis."

The clinical records of 35 adult patients with severe MID who received emergency surgery for acute abdomen between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed. The median duration from onset to surgery was 48 hours. There were 2 cases of in-hospital mortality (5.7%), and all the patients underwent surgery more than 72 hours after onset. The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients who received surgery later than 72 hours after onset. Bowel obstruction was the most common disease among the acute abdomen cases (71.4%) and most often involved volvulus of the small bowel and cecum. Of the patients with bowel obstruction with severe MID, 72.0% had abdominal distention, 16.0% had abdominal pain, and 4.0% had vomiting. The median duration from onset to surgery was significantly longer in the patients with bowel obstruction with severe MID than in those without severe MID (24 hours vs. 16 hours). Acute abdomen in patients with severe MID was often due to bowel obstruction caused by volvulus. Because patients with severe MID have few symptoms, they are susceptible to adverse surgical outcomes associated with a prolonged duration from onset to surgery."

From October 2021 to June 2022, 92 children aged 5 to 17 years who presented with acute abdomen and suspected acute appendicitis were enrolled in this prospective study. The parameters documented included demographic and clinical information, as well as operative and postoperative data. Patients were divided into two groups: those with acute appendicitis who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (n = 46) and those without appendicitis (n = 46). The total white blood cell (WBC) count, percent of neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and salivary LRG1 were compared between groups. A commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) LRG kit was used to measure the LRG levels. The median salivary LRG1 level was significantly higher in the group of children with pathohistologically confirmed acute appendicitis compared to the control group: 233.45 ng/mL (IQR 114.9, 531.2) vs. 55.95 ng/mL (IQR 51.5, 117.9), p < 0.001. LRG1 had an overall good receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve of 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.92; p < 0.001). The optimal LRG1 cutoff with best separation between acute appendicitis and the controls was >352.6 ng/mL (95% CI from >270.7 to >352.6). Although the specificity was 100% at this cutoff, the sensitivity for identifying appendicitis was 36%. In addition, a significant difference was found between groups in the laboratory values of all inflammatory markers tested: WBC, absolute neutrophil count, and CRP (p < 0.001 for all). Although LRG1 in saliva showed a good AUC parameter and significantly higher values in patients with acute appendicitis compared to the controls, its usefulness in the patient population who present at emergency departments with abdominal pain is debatable. Future studies should focus on investigating its diagnostic potential."

However, its utilization remains low in tier-two and tier-three cities of India, and there exists a significant variation in the practice. In the present study, we have investigated the safety and feasibility of these protocols or pathways in emergency surgery for perforated duodenal ulcer disease. Methods A total of 41 patients with perforated duodenal ulcers were randomly divided into two groups. All the patients across the study were treated surgically with the open Graham patch repair technique. Patients in group A were managed with ERAS protocols, while patients in group B were managed with conventional peri-operative practices. A comparison was established between the two groups in terms of the duration of hospital stay and other postoperative parameters. Results The study was conducted on 41 patients who presented during the study period. Group A patients (n=19) were managed with standard protocols, and group B patients (n=22) were managed with conventional standard protocols. As compared to the standard care group, patients in the ERAS group showed quicker postoperative recovery and lesser complications. The need for nasogastric (NG) tube reinsertion, postoperative pain, postoperative ileus, and surgical site infections (SSI) were all significantly lower in the patients of the ERAS group. A significant reduction in the length of hospital stay (LOHS) was found in the ERAS group when compared to the standard care group (relative risk {RR}=61.2; p=0.000). Conclusions The application of ERAS protocols with certain modifications in the management of perforated duodenal ulcers yields significant outcomes in terms of reduced duration of hospital stay and fewer postoperative complications in a selected subgroup of patients. However, the application of ERAS pathways in an emergency setup needs to be further evaluated to develop standardized protocols for a surgical emergency group of patients."

    "title": "Risk Factors for Abscess Development in Patients with Endometrioma Who Present with an Acute Abdomen.",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the potential risk factors for abscess development in patients with endometrioma who present with an acute abdomen. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 51 patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute abdomen involving an endometrioma at our hospital between April 2011 and August 2021. The patients were divided into an infected group (n = 22) and a control group (n = 29). We analyzed patient characteristics; imaging findings; clinical data, including bacterial cultures; and perioperative outcomes to assess for differences between groups. Patients in the infected group were significantly older than those in the control group (P = 0.03). They were more likely to have a history of endometriosis surgery (P = 0.04) and more likely to have undergone transvaginal manipulation within 3 months of presentation (P = 0.01). Body temperature on the day of admission was significantly higher in the infected group (P = 0.007), as were C-reactive protein levels on the day of admission and before surgery (P < 0.001; P = 0.018) and the white blood cell count on the day of admission (P = 0.016). Preoperative imaging showed significant thickening of the tumor wall (P < 0.001) and an enhanced contrast effect (P < 0.001) in the infected group. We identified several factors that suggest abscess in patients with an acute abdomen who have a complication of pathologically confirmed endometriosis. A recent vaginal procedure is a particular risk factor for abscess development in patients with endometriomas."

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile´s fulminant colitis is characterized by the development of severe acute inflammation of the colon, associated with systemic toxicity. Fulminant colitis is the most serious form of acute colitis with a mortality of up to 80%. We present the case of a 45-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever. Computed tomography showed circumferential diffuse parietal thickening of the colon, including the rectum, associated with striation of the surrounding tissues and ganglionic formations. In the following hours the patient evolved with worsening of the general condition, increased inotropic requirements and lactic acidosis. Emergency laparotomy was decided and total colectomy was performed. Fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis is a potentially deadly disease. The lability of the pathology in many occasions forces quick decision making, therefore fulminant colitis represents a medical surgical emergency being time crucial. La colitis fulminante por Clostridium difficile se caracteriza por el desarrollo de una inflamación aguda severa del colon, asociada a toxicidad sistémica, y es la forma más grave de colitis aguda con una mortalidad de hasta el 80%. Presentamos el caso de un varón de 45 años que acude al servicio de urgencias por dolor abdominal agudo, diarrea y fiebre. La tomografía computarizada mostró engrosamiento parietal difuso circunferencial del colon, incluido el recto, asociado con estriación de los tejidos circundantes y formaciones ganglionares. En las horas siguientes el paciente evolucionó con empeoramiento del estado general, aumento de los requerimientos de inotrópicos y acidosis láctica. Se decide laparotomía de urgencia y se realiza colectomía total. La colitis fulminante por Clostridium difficile es una enfermedad potencialmente mortal. La labilidad de la patología obliga en muchas ocasiones a tomar una rápida conducta, por lo que representa una urgencia médico-quirúrgica siendo el tiempo crucial."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum is the most common gastrointestinal tract's congenital abnormality. Spontaneous perforation of Meckel's diverticulum is very rare and can mimic acute appendicitis. Here we report the case of an 11-year-old male patient, who was presented to the Surgical A unit of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad on 21st January, 2021 with one-day history of abdominal pain, predominantly in the periumbilical area and right iliac fossa, associated with nausea. On physical examination his abdomen was tense, tender with guarding and generalized rigidity. A provisional diagnosis of perforated appendix or enteric perforation of a hollow viscus was made. The patient had an emergency laparotomy, where a perforated Meckel's diverticulum was discovered. Resection of the portion of gut containing Meckel's diverticulum was done along with primary anastomosis. Heterotopic gastric mucosa of diverticulitis, associated with perforation was confirmed on histopathology. The patient made an uneventful recovery during postoperative period. This case report is an interesting and an unusual case of Meckel's diverticulum complication. It highlights the importance of considering Meckel's diverticulum as a differential diagnosis in every patient presenting with acute abdomen in this age group."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is one of the most common causes of acute abdomen conditions and continues to cause mortality and morbidity despite all the improvements. There is still a necessity for inexpensive and easily calculable index and scoring systems with fewer side effects for the diagnosis of AA and the detection of complications. Since the systemic immune-inflammation index (SIII) is an index that could be used in this context, we aimed to measure the success and reliability of SIII for the diagnosis of AA and related complications and to contribute to the literature. Our study was carried out retrospectively in a tertiary care hospital and conducted with 180 AA patients (study group-SG) and 180 control group (CG) patients. Demographic data, laboratory data, and clinical data of the cases, as well as the Alvarado score (AS), adult appendicitis score (AAS), and SIII and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values calculated from laboratory data, were recorded in the previously created study form. p<0.05 was accepted as the significance level for the study. In this study, age and gender were similar in the SG and CG groups. SIII and NLR levels calculated in SG cases were found to be significantly higher than CG. In addition, SIII and NLR levels were found to be significantly higher in complicated AA cases than in complicated cases. Although SIII was more significant in the diagnosis of AA, NLR was more successful than SIII in detecting the presence of complications. SIII, NLR, AAS, and AS were significantly positively correlated in the diagnosis of AA. In the presence of peritonitis, SIII and NLR were also found to be significantly higher when compared to cases without peritonitis. We found that SIII is a usable index in the diagnosis of AA and the prediction of complicated AA. However, NLR was found to be more significant than SIII in estimating complicated AA. In addition, it is recommended to be careful in terms of peritonitis in cases with high SIII and NLR levels."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that, with delayed treatment, may be associated with loss of the testis. It commonly presents with sudden onset testicular pain, vague lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Management often requires emergent surgical scrotal exploration, detorsion, and fixation or removal of the affected testis. Retrospective review of all the patients in a hospital covering the Muharraq district in Bahrain presenting with testicular pain. During the six-year period from 2015 to 2021, 48 patients with testicular torsion were managed, with a mean age of 18.4 (± 9.2) years. Most patients (54.7%) presented within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. All 48 patients underwent a doppler ultrasound, which confirmed the presence of testicular torsion in 87.5% of patients, with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 98.5%. Fourteen patients had non-viable testis on surgical exploration, with an average age of 16.6 (± 6.8) years and took an average of 13 to 24 hours to present to the emergency department after the start of pain. Most patients underwent scrotal ultrasound 60 minutes from the presentation to the emergency department and surgical exploration within 120 to 179 minutes. The rate of testicular torsion in patients who underwent diagnostic ultrasound at 60 minutes or more from presentation was 40%, compared to an overall rate of 29%. All detected cases of testicular torsion, except for one case, underwent bilateral fixation of the testes. Of those patients who underwent contralateral fixation, none presented with contralateral torsion, supporting the recommendation of contralateral fixation. Patients underwent comprehensive assessment of their complaint and emergent surgical intervention, including an ultrasound that did not delay the surgical intervention. We agree that clinical judgment is the primary tool for assessment of patients with acute scrotum and an adjunct emergent ultrasound does not significantly cause delays. We concur with the current recommendations for contralateral fixation and prompt surgical management as the anatomical anomaly is present bilaterally."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric cystic lymphangioma (MCL) is a rare benign intraperitoneal mass with congenital origin, and it is extremely rare in adults. Mesentery is an unusual location for cystic lymphangioma too. Clinical presentations are nonspecific, and diagnosis is challenging. It can mimic other surgical complications like appendicitis or any acute abdomen causes, so the review of cases is necessary for the best management and surgical planning. We have presented a 22-year-old man presented with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In laparotomy, a cyst was found with large size around the small intestine which caused mesenteric ischemia and changed the color of the small bowel to an ischemic view. The resected cyst was sent and confirmed by the pathology as lymphangiomatosis. MCL is a rare cause of obstruction, which was found accidentally in this case. MCLs are clinically challenging lesions with unspecific broad spectrum of clinical presentation ranges. We discuss a rare finding in an adult with intestinal volvulus and mesenteric ischemia. Medical literature and reviews have been searched to find more relevant information about MCLs for the better optimal planning in surgery. MCL is a challenging and infrequent case of surgery. Most of the time, it does not cause any complications, but it can also cause some life-threatening conditions like mesenteric ischemia or volvulus and lead to emergent surgery. Complete tumor removal is optimal for managing intra-abdominal cystic lymphangioma with the slightest chance of recurrence."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain (AP) is one of the main reasons for consultation in the emergency department worldwide. The causes of AP are gathered in a broad group of pathologies whose incidence and prevalence vary according to various factors. The great importance of an adequate approach to AP lies in ruling out or confirming the presence of acute abdomen that requires emergency surgical management. Valentino's Syndrome (VS) simulates the clinical manifestations of acute appendicitis whose origin is the perforation of a peptic ulcer. This is an infrequent entity, with very few reports in the literature, this being the second case reported in Colombia. We present a case of VS in a 59-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department with 3 days of pain in the right iliac fossa that met the diagnostic criteria for acute appendicitis. However, upon surgical exploration, it was determined that the cause was secondary to peptic ulcer perforation (PPU). PPU is one of the most infrequent complications of the disease, occurring in close to 10 % of cases, and is considered a surgical emergency. Minimally invasive surgery provides a significant benefit over open surgery, outcomes that directly lead to decreased healthcare costs and increased patient satisfaction. PPU represents a diagnostic challenge due to the variability of the symptoms and clinical features. Laparoscopic approach fulfills diagnostic and therapeutic roles with lesser morbidity and mortality rates, which is why it should be standardized. Malignancy should be ruled out in all cases."

The records of patients who underwent urgent IBI due to acutely presenting IAL between January 2013 and January 2020 were reviewed retrospectively in terms of age, presenting symptoms, cyst type, number of injections, pre- and post-treatment cyst volume, clinical response, complications, and follow-up. Six patients with a mean age of 4.3 years (2-13 years) were treated. Presenting symptoms were acute abdominal pain (n=4), abdominal distention (n=1), hypoproteinemia and chylous ascites (n=1). Lesions were of macrocystic type in four and macro and micro cystic in two patients. The median number of injections performed was 2 (1-11). Mean cyst volume reduced dramatically from 567 cm3 (range 117-1656) to 3.4 cm3 (range 0-13.8) after treatment (p=0.028). Treatment response was excellent in four patients with complete resolution of the cysts, while good in the remaining two. No early or late complications or recurrence was observed in a mean follow-up period of 40 months (16-56 months). IBI is a safe, fast, and easily applicable method with satisfactory results in the treatment of acutely presenting IAL. It may be recommended in primary as well as recurrent lesions."

A few imaging modalities are at disposal of primary care physicians like plain x-ray and ultrasonography. This study has been done to compare the efficacy of clinical diagnosis, plain radiography and sonography in diagnosis of non-traumatic acute abdomen. Every patient under study admitted in the Department of General Surgery underwent thorough clinical evaluation, biochemical investigations, X-rays and sonography. Findings of clinical evaluation, X-Rays and sonography were compared to the final diagnosis found intraoperatively. Clinical diagnosis was made in 47 (94%) out of 50 patients. X-rays were able to diagnose in 20 patients (40%) whereas sonography diagnosed 26 patients (52%). The present study showed that clinical evaluation, x-rays or Ultrasound alone are not sufficient to diagnose cause of non-traumatic acute abdomen in all cases. Clinical evaluation combined with x-rays and ultrasound increases the number and accuracy of pre-operative diagnosis in non-traumatic acute abdomen."

However, it has rarely been described in duodenal perforations. Our purpose is to highlight the possibility of conservative treatment in selected cases of duodenal perforation. In the period between 2009 and 2022, 6 children were treated for duodenal injury following abdominal blunt trauma in the pediatric surgical emergency department. The clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment are reported and analyzed. Three patients presented with duodenal hematomas, they were treated non-operatively with hospital stays between 12 and 20 days and good clinical outcome. One child presented with duodenal hematoma and retroperitoneal air bubbles; non-operative conservative treatment was carried with favorable results. The fifth patient had a duodenal perforation; he underwent a primary duodenal 2-layers closure. The last patient had a combination of duodenal hematoma and perforation involving 75% of the duodenal diameter for which he underwent a gastro-jejunostomy with pyloric exclusion. An isolated duodenal lesion can be subject to a conservative treatment whenever allowed by a stable clinical condition and the availability of appropriate clinical and radiological monitoring."

    "abstract": "The challenges of an adequate, efficient and rational medical treatment and care of patients are always associated with an interprofessional activity of several specialist disciplines. The spectrum of variable diagnoses and the profile of surgical decision-making with further surgical measures within the framework of senior physician consultation in general and visceral surgery for neighboring medical disciplines were analyzed on a representative patient cohort over a defined observational time period. All consecutive patients (n = 549 cases) were documented as part of a clinical systematic prospective single center observational study at a tertiary center using a computer-based patient registry over 10 years (1 October 2006-30 September 2016). The data were analyzed with respect to the spectrum of clinical findings, diagnoses, treatment decisions and the influencing factors as well as gender and age differences and time-dependent developmental trends using χ2-tests and U‑tests. The predominant discipline for requests for surgical consultation was cardiology (19.9%) followed by surgical disciplines (11.8%) and gastroenterology (11.3%). Disorders of wound healing (7.1%) and acute abdomen (7.1%) were predominant in the diagnostic profile. In 11.7% of the patients the indications for immediate surgery were derived, whereas in 12.9% elective surgery was recommended. The conformity rate of suspected and definitive diagnoses was only 58.4%. The surgical consultation work is an important mainstay of a sufficient and especially timely clarification of surgically relevant questions in nearly all medical institutions and especially in a center. This serves i) the quality assurance of surgery in the clinical care of patients with need of additional interdisciplinary needs for surgical treatment in the daily practice of general and abdominal surgery in research on clinical care, ii) clinical marketing and monetary aspects in the sense of patient recruitment and iii) last but not least to provide emergency care of patients. Due to the high proportion of 12% of subsequent emergency operations, which were derived from requests for general and visceral surgical consultations, such requests must be processed promptly during working hours. HINTERGRUND: Die Herausforderungen einer adäquaten, effizienten und rationellen medizinischen Versorgung und Betreuung von Patienten stehen immer im Zusammenhang mit der interprofessionellen Tätigkeit mehrerer Fachdisziplinen. ZIEL: Die Breite variabler Diagnosen und des Profils der chirurgischen Entscheidungsfindung mit weiterführenden chirurgischen Maßnahmen im Rahmen des allgemein- und viszeralchirurgischen Oberarztkonsils für medizinische Nachbardisziplinen wurde über einen definierten Beobachtungszeitraum an einer repräsentativen Patientenklientel analysiert.

It is usually associated with chronic liver disease and has a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate during the acute phase. SRHCC can cause a severe and urgent condition of acute abdomen disease and requires a correct diagnosis to achieve adequate treatment. Clinical presentation is related to the presence of hemoperitoneum, and abdominal pain is the most common symptom (66-100% of cases). Although the treatment approach is not unique, trans-arterial (chemo)embolization (TAE/TACE) followed by staged hepatectomy has shown better results in long-term survival. A multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scan is a pivotal technique in the diagnosis of SRHCC due to its diagnostic accuracy and optimal temporal resolution. The correct interpretation of the main CT findings in SRHCC, such as active contrast extravasation and the sentinel clot sign, is fundamental for a prompt and correct diagnosis. Furthermore, CT also plays a role as a post-operative control procedure, especially in patients treated with TAE/TACE. Therefore, a multi-phase CECT scan should be the diagnostic tool of choice in SRHCC since it suggests an immediate need for treatment with a consequent improvement in prognosis."

Niemeier classified GBP into three types each characterized by specific signs and symptoms. Radiological investigations such as abdominal ultrasonography (USG) and computed tomography (CT) are crucial to evaluate and diagnosing GBP, while fistulae are usually identified intraoperatively. A 77-year-old female patient, with a background medical history of multiple comorbidities, presented to our hospital with a one-week history of abdominal pain. Laboratory investigations showed abnormal values. The abdominal CT scan revealed a mildly enlarged liver, distended gallbladder, and liver abscess. Then, ultrasound-guided aspiration was done, and the clinical picture was consistent with calcular cholecystitis complicated with liver abscess. So, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and the intraoperatively detected fistula was excised. The resected perforated gallbladder was sent for histopathological studies. The postoperative period was uneventful. GBP is an unusual entity that is categorized into three types. It is considered a gallbladder complication and surgical emergency. The clinical features of GBP are non-specific and radiological tools aid in diagnosis demonstration. In the presented case of type III GBP, cholecystohepatic fistula was detected and excised intraoperatively. Due to the rare entity of type III GBP in association with liver abscess, we report the case of a 77-year-old female with right lower quadrant pain, found to be caused by type III GBP with cholecystohepatic fistula and liver abscess."

We describe cases of ileoileal knotting in 13 and 12-year-old male and female adolescents who presented with crampy abdominal pain, distension, and episodes of vomiting. Both had tachycardia and features of peritonitis. They were explored and gangrenous ileoileal knotting was found. After the knot was disentangled, the gangrenous portion was resected, and ileoileal and ileo-ascending anastomosis were performed respectively. After a smooth postoperative course, the patients were discharged home in good condition. The etiopathogenesis of ileoileal knotting is unknown, but speculative mechanisms are proposed, such as loaded bowel with longer mesentery, vigorous peristalsis, and a single bulky meal. The presentation includes abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, and obstipation. Management involves a high index of suspicion and emergent exploration with the majority requiring resection and anastomosis or exteriorization of the involved segment. We discuss these cases of Ileoileal knotting to emphasize that it is a usual intraoperative surprise given the paucity of cases. But sudden and severe abdominal pain and distension, and features of peritonitis in short duration may be considered clues for suspicion. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment and hence, the prognosis depends on early diagnosis and intervention as morbidity and mortality are very high because of the rapid progression to gangrene."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening surgical emergency with a poor prognosis. This study assessed the association of diffuse reduction of spleen density (DROSD) with postoperative complications and identified risk factors for adverse outcomes in AMI patients after surgery. Patients who were diagnosed with AMI and underwent surgical operations between April 2006 and July 2021 were enrolled. Spleen density was assessed using preoperative non-enhanced computed tomography. The lowest quartile of spleen density in all patients was regarded as the cutoff value for DROSD. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the risk factors related to postoperative outcomes after surgery. According to the diagnostic cutoff, patients with a spleen density ≤49.07 HU were defined as DROSD. In a cohort of 97 patients, 34.0% developed complications within 30 days of surgery. The multivariate analysis illustrated that DROSD was an independent risk factor for prognostic outcomes in AMI patients after surgery. Patients with low spleen density were prone to postoperative complications. As an imaging method, preoperative assessment of spleen density is a novel predictor that can be used clinically to identify high-risk AMI patients with poor prognosis."

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) remain a surgical emergency accounting for 37% of all peptic ulcer-related deaths. Surgery remains the standard of care. The benefits of laparoscopic approach have been well-established even in the elderly. However, because of inconsistent results with specific regard to some technical aspects of such technique surgeons questioned the adoption of laparoscopic approach. This leads to choose the type of approach based on personal experience. The aim of our study was to critically appraise the use of the laparoscopic approach in PPU treatment comparing it with open procedure. A retrospective study with propensity score matching analysis of patients underwent surgical procedure for PPU was performed. Patients undergoing PPU repair were divided into: Laparoscopic approach (LapA) and Open approach (OpenA) groups and clinical-pathological features of patients in the both groups were compared. A total of 453 patients underwent PPU simple repair. Among these, a LapA was adopted in 49% (222/453 patients). After propensity score matching, 172 patients were included in each group (the LapA and the OpenA). Analysis demonstrated increased operative times in the OpenA [OpenA: 96.4 ± 37.2 vs LapA 88.47 ± 33 min, p = 0.035], with shorter overall length of stay in the LapA group [OpenA 13 ± 12 vs LapA 10.3 ± 11.4 days p = 0.038]. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality [OpenA 26 (15.1%) vs LapA 18 (10.5%), p = 0.258]. Focusing on morbidity, the overall rate of 30-day postoperative morbidity was significantly lower in the LapA group [OpenA 67 patients (39.0%) vs LapA 37 patients (21.5%) p = 0.002]. When stratified using the Clavien-Dindo classification, the severity of postoperative complications was statistically different only for C-D 1-2. Based on the present study, we can support that laparoscopic suturing of perforated peptic ulcers, apart from being a safe technique, could provide significant advantages in terms of postoperative complications and hospital stay."

    "abstract": "In this report, we present a case in which intestinal and abdominal wall emphysema was observed, but the patient was unconscious due to hypothermia, making it difficult to determine the indication for surgery. Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is a pathological condition characterized by the presence of gas within the walls of the small or large intestine and is considered a surgical emergency when accompanied by manifestations of peritonitis on abdominal examination, metabolic acidosis, and lactic acid levels above 2.0 mmol/L. In this specific case, the patient's blood draw results indicated the requirement for an emergency laparotomy; however, the patient's unconscious state became a challenge to make decision on informed consenting. The case illustrates the difficulties encountered in making treatment decisions in critically ill patients and the necessity for thorough assessments and close monitoring of vital signs in such patients."

    "abstract": "To analyze the etiologies and the varying clinical presentations and to validate the clinical, biochemical, and radiological signs with severity and prognosis of acute pancreatitis. A retrospective study of 1316 patients diagnosed with acute pancreatitis in an industrial hospital in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, was conducted, and their clinicoradiological profiles, etiological factors, and outcomes were studied. A total of 1316 cases were enrolled, out of which maximum cases (411 [31.23%]) were from the age group of 30-44 years, and the mean and median age were 44.54 and 47 years, respectively. A total of 731 (55.45%) patients had social habits (i.e., alcohol and smoking), and 585 (44.45%) patients did not have any social habits. Based on the etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP), the majority of cases were due to alcoholism (710 [53.95%]) followed by gallstone (343 [26.06%]) and idiopathic pancreatitis (217 [16.48%]). As per the severity of AP, most patients showed mild pancreatitis (937 [71.20%]) followed by moderate (312 [23.71%]) and severe pancreatitis (67 [05.09%]). Mild and moderate pancreatitis patients were shown in 85 and 28 cases, respectively, suggestive of chronic pancreatitis after repeated episodes of AP. But severe pancreatitis shown in 19 cases had hypocalcemia + shock + multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). In mild, moderate, and severe AP, the mortality rates were 19 (02.03%), 44 (14.10%), and 21 (31.34%), respectively. Overall, 1232 (93.62%) of AP cases recovered and were discharged in stable condition, but 84 (06.38%) cases expired. AP is a common cause of acute abdomen in patients presenting to the surgical emergency department. The management is mainly conservative with surgery limited to only a few selected cases, depending upon the severity of the disease."

    "abstract": "Paediatric abdominal pain continues to pose a diagnostic challenge in the acute hospital care setting. We describe an eleven-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with acute-onset, sharp abdominal pain localised to right lower quadrant. Abdominal imaging was diagnostic for epiploic appendagitis (EA), with pathognomonic 'ring sign' and 'central dot' visualised on the axial computed tomography images. He responded well to conservative treatment, including a short course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. EA is a lesser-known paediatric entity mimicking surgical conditions. However, steady but sharp and non-migratory characteristic of the pain in either of the lower abdominal quadrants should raise suspicion for EA. Early accurate diagnosis can prevent unnecessary surgical exploration in these patients."

Oftentimes, it is a surgical emergency requiring exploratory laparotomy as most cases of pneumoperitoneum are due to perforated hollow viscus. However, not all pneumoperitoneum cases are surgical; nonsurgical pneumoperitoneum can arise from thoracic, abdominal, gynecologic, and other causes. We present a case of a 35-year-old male who developed a non-surgical pneumoperitoneum in the setting of drug overdose. The patient underwent robot-assisted diagnostic laparoscopy without findings of perforation or other pathology. Resolution of pneumoperitoneum was evidenced on follow-up computed tomography scan. This case emphasizes the importance of diagnostic laparoscopy in the setting of a confusing clinical picture and the feasibility of utilizing the robotic approach in hemodynamically stable patients."

In this work we present the clinical course of a patient affected by a surgically treated melanoma of the right conjunctiva, suddenly manifesting abdominal symptomatology. The abdominal computed tomography scan (CT scan) show evidence of free air into the peritoneal cavity, cholecystitis and brain lesions highly suspicious for metastases. Patient underwent emergency surgery, consisting of ileo-cecal resection, cholecystectomy, with the construction of an ileostomy. The histological examination diagnosed multiple ileal and gallbladder localizations of pigmented epithelial melanoma, and localization. The treatment of conjunctival melanoma consists in surgical removal. Distant metastases frequently affect the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the necessity to assess patients with abdominal symptoms, in order to avoid emergency scenarios such as the one reported in our study. Intra-abdominal metastases from melanoma are an event that should not be underestimated, because if detected in time, they can be treated with surgery resulting in a clear improvement in the prognosis. Late diagnosis of intestinal metastases can cause an acute abdomen scenario frequently caused by intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding."

Intestinal ischemia of the midgut as a consequence of volvulus from malrotation is a fateful event with high mortality and significant morbidity even in survivors. Derotation followed by correction of malrotation is the procedure of choice though has significant morbidity if intestinal reperfusion was not successful. A combined treatment to restore intestinal perfusion based on the digital massage of the superior mesenteric artery after derotation and systemic infusion of fibrinolytic has been previously reported with success but underused. Here, we report three such cases of midgut malrotation with severe intestinal ischemia due to volvulus. A retrospective analysis of three confirmed cases of midgut malrotation with volvulus managed with emergency laparotomy, derotation, and Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) massage with systemic fibrinolytic therapy, followed by correction of malrotation was evaluated. There was dramatic improvement in intestinal perfusion noted in all three patients inspite of delayed presentation. 2 out of 3 patients on follow up are doing well with adequate weight gain while 1 patient succumbed due to sepsis. Critical intestinal ischemia due to mesenteric thrombosis can persist after derotation of midgut volvulus and can lead to devastating consequences. The use of digital massage of SMA to disrupt the thrombus along with fibrinolytic therapy though reported is underutilized. Hence, awareness of this management and usage needs to be re-emphasized."

A 60-year-old man presented with an acute abdomen and septic shock. Urgent laparotomy and a subtotal colectomy were performed. Further imaging suggested the malignancy was secondary to a primary lung cancer. Histopathology demonstrated a ruptured small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma in the appendix with thyroid transcription factor 1 positive immunohistochemistry. Unfortunately, the patient deteriorated due to respiratory compromise and was palliated day six postoperatively. Surgeons should consider a broad differential diagnosis for the cause of acute perforated appendicitis as this can rarely be due to a secondary metastatic deposit from a widespread malignant process."

    "abstract": "Surgical acute abdomen is a sudden onset of severe abdominal symptoms (pain, vomiting, constipation etc.) indicative of a possible life-threatening intra-abdominal pathology, with most cases requiring immediate surgical intervention. Most studies from developing countries have focused on complications related to delayed diagnosis of specific abdominal problems like intestinal obstruction or acute appendicitis and only a few studies have assessed factors related to the delay in patients with acute abdomen. This study focused on the time from the onset of a surgical acute abdomen to presentation to determine factors that led to delayed reporting among these patients at the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) and aimed to close the knowledge gap on the incidence, presentation, etiology, and death rates for acute abdomen in Tanzania. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study at MNH, Tanzania. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of the surgical acute abdomen were consecutively enrolled in the study over a period of 6 months and data on the onset of symptoms, time of presentation to the hospital, and events during the illness were collected. Age was significantly associated with delayed hospital presentation, with older groups presenting later than younger ones. Informal education and being uneducated were factors contributing to delayed presentation, while educated groups presented early, albeit the difference was statistically insignificant (p = 0.121). Patients working in the government sector had the lowest percentage of delayed presentation compared to those in the private sector and self-employed individuals, however, the difference was statistically insignificant. Family and cohabiting individuals showed late presentation (p = 0.03). Deficiencies in health care staff on duty, unfamiliarity with the medical facilities, and low experience in dealing with emergency cases were associated with the factors for delayed surgical care among patients. Delays in the presentation to the hospital increased mortality and morbidity, especially among patients who needed emergency surgical care. Delayed reporting for surgical care among patients with surgical acute abdomen in underdeveloped countries like Tanzania is often not due to a single reason. The causes are distributed across several levels including the patient's age and family, deficiency in medical staff on duty and lack of experience in dealing with emergency cases, educational level, working sectors, socioeconomic and sociocultural status of the country."

It can result in compression and obstruction of the third part of the duodenum leading to life-threatening dilation and perforation of the proximal duodenum and stomach. We report a rare case of a patient with postural abnormality secondary to multiple sclerosis and a borderline but normal aortomesenteric axis who developed SMAS following a paraesophageal hernia repair with Nissen fundoplication complicated by massive gastric dilation and perforation secondary due to a closed-loop-like foregut obstruction. The patient was managed with emergent damage control surgery and washout with delayed duodenojejunostomy for SMAS. SMAS with partial obstruction can mimic common complications after Nissen fundoplication such as gas-bloat syndrome. SMAS with complete obstruction is a life-threatening surgical emergency. Postoperative weight loss, large hiatal hernia reduction, gas-bloat syndrome and postural changes in this patient may have contributed to an altered aortomesenteric axis and promoted the development of SMAS. Identifying possible predisposing factors should heighten vigilance and prompt radiological evaluation and surgical management to prevent life-threatening complications. SMAS after Nissen fundoplication is a potentially life-threatening complication that presents with non-specific symptoms mimicking common complications like gas-bloat syndrome. A high index of suspicious should prompt early radiological evaluation in patients with predisposing factors."

After the diagnosis of SAH, physicians should find the reason for the bleeding. CT- Angiography (CTA) and Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) are techniques used to visualize the aneurysm. However, which one will surgeons prefer? In this study, we have compared these two radiological examinations. This study includes 58 patients diagnosed with SAH and intracranial aneurysm diagnosis based on CTA (n=30) and DSA (n=28). We evaluated the patients according to demographic properties, CTA and DAS findings, aneurysm location, Fisher score, postoperative complications, and Glasgow outcome score. The most common location of aneurysms was the M1 level (48.3%). Patients in the DSA group had significantly more extended hospital stays (p= 0.021). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in complications. Enhanced CT Technologies provide higher fidelity images and shorten hospital stays. With CTA, surgeons may gain time for an emergency surgical procedure. Despite the fact that DSA remains a significant factor in aneurysm diagnosis, DSA is an invasive procedure and needs more time to diagnose."

Our objective was to compare imaging practices and negative appendectomy rates between patients transferred from nonpediatric hospitals to our pediatric hospital and primary patients presenting directly to our institution. We retrospectively reviewed all laparoscopic appendectomy cases performed at our pediatric hospital in 2017 for imaging and histopathologic results. Two-sample z-test was used to examine negative appendectomy rates between transfer and primary patients. The negative appendectomy rates of patients who received different imaging modalities were analyzed using the Fisher's exact test. Of 626 patients, 321 (51%) were transferred from nonpediatric hospitals. The negative appendectomy rate for transfer patients was 6.5% and 6.6% for primary patients (p = 0.99). Ultrasound (US) was the only imaging obtained in 31% of transfer and 82% of primary patients. The negative appendectomy rate of US performed at transfer hospitals compared with our pediatric institution was not significantly different (11% vs. 5%, p = 0.06). Computed tomography (CT) was the only imaging obtained in 34% of transfer and 5% of primary patients. Both US and CT were completed for 17% of transfer and 19% of primary patients. The negative appendectomy rates of transfer and primary patients were not significantly different despite more frequent CT use at nonpediatric facilities. It may be valuable to encourage US utilization at adult facilities given the potential to safely reduce CT use in the evaluation of suspected pediatric appendicitis."

Preoperative diagnosis of ingested WT is a challenge because of its unspecific clinical presentation, the low sensitivity rate of radiological investigations and the patient's inability to often recall the event of swallowing a WT. Surgery represents the main treatment in case of ingested WT-induced complications. A 72-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever. Physical examination revealed LLQ abdominal pain and rebound tenderness with muscle guarding. Laboratory tests reported high levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed colonic diverticulosis, wall thickening of the sigmoid colon, pericolic abscess, regional fatty infiltration, a suspicion of sigmoid perforation secondary to a foreign body. The patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy: a sigmoid diverticular perforation caused by an ingested WT was noticed and a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with end-to-end Knight-Griffen colorectal anastomosis, partial omentectomy and protective loop ileostomy were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. The ingestion of a WT represents a rare but potentially fatal condition which may cause GI perforation with peritonitis, abscesses and other rare complications if it migrates out of the GI tract. Ingested WT may cause serious GI injuries with peritonitis, sepsis or death. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality. Surgery is mandatory in case of ingested WT-induced GI perforation and peritonitis."

The numbers and age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and YLD rates per 100,000 population of appendicitis were estimated across regions and countries by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI). All the estimates were reported with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Globally, the age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates of appendicitis in 2019 were 8.7 (95% UI 6.9 to 11.0) and 229.9 (95% UI 180.9 to 291.0) per 100,000 population, with increases of 20.8% (95% UI 18.9 to 23.0%) and 20.5% (95% UI 18.7 to 22.8%) from 1990 to 2019, respectively. Additionally, the age-standardized YLDs rate was 2.7 (95% UI 1.8 to 3.9) in 2019, with an increase of 20.4% (95% UI 16.2 to 25.1%) from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and YLD rates peaked in the 15-to-19-year age groups in both male and female individuals.

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most frequent intra-abdominal diseases requiring emergency surgical consult and treatment. The diagnosis of this condition is based on clinical features and radiologic findings. One-third of patients with acute appendicitis present unusual symptoms. There are several circumstances that may cause misdiagnosis and unclear prognostic prediction. Among these, situs viscerum inversus totalis and midgut malrotation can be challenging scenarios, leading to a delay in treatment, especially when these conditions are unknown. We decided to carry on a systematic review of published cases of acute appendicitis in the context of anatomical anomalies. We used the MESH terms \"appendicitis\" AND \"situs inversus\" AND/OR \"gut malrotation\" to search for titles and abstracts. Inclusion criteria were patients with clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of acute appendicitis, with conservative or surgical management and with preoperative/intraoperative findings of situs viscerum inversus or gut malrotation. Additionally, previous reviews were examined. Exclusion criteria of the studies were insufficient patient clinical and demographic data. We included in this review 70 articles concerning 73 cases of acute appendicitis with anatomical anomaly. Patients were aged from 8 to 86 years (median: 27.0 years). 50 were male and 23 were female. 46 patients (63%) had situs viscerum inversus, 24 (33%) had midgut malrotation, 2 (2.7%) had Kartagener's syndrome, one of them (1.4%) had an undetermined anomaly In 61 patients the anatomical anomaly was unknown previously (83.6%), while 16,4% already were aware of their condition. Acute appendicitis can occur in association of rare anatomical anomalies and in these cases diagnosis can be challenging. Situs viscerum inversus and midgut malrotation should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient with left lower quadrant pain, especially in younger population. Besides clinical features, it is fundamental to implement the diagnostic progress with radiological examination. Laparoscopic approach is useful to identify and treat acute surgical emergency and it is also a diagnostic tool and can be tailored in order to offer the best exposition of the operatory field for each single case."

He underwent an emergency C7-T1 laminectomy with hematoma evacuation and had a full recovery. Cervical epidural hematoma is a rare surgical emergency where timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus is a rare entity and constitutes an uncommon complication of gallstone disease. It is caused by the impaction of a gallstone in the gastrointestinal tract and may cause serious symptoms or even life-threatening complications. It should be part of the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen especially in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction and known gallstone disease. An early diagnosis is essential, and surgical treatment is the gold standard in order to relieve the obstruction. We present the case of an 84-year-old male patient with gallstone ileus due to cholecysto-intestinal fistula and impacted gallstone at jejunum. He was treated via urgent enterolithotomy, and his post-operative period was uneventful. This report aims to further educate clinical doctors on this rare medical condition which may pose a potentially serious health risk."

    "abstract": "Acute bowel diseases are responsible for more than one third of subjects who were referred to the emergency department for acute abdominal pain and gastrointestinal evaluation. Gastrointestinal ultrasound (GIUS) is often employed as the first imaging method, with a good diagnostic accuracy in the setting of acute abdomen, and it can be an optimal diagnostic strategy in young females due to the radiation exposure related to X-ray and computed tomography methods. The physician can examine the gastrointestinal system in the area with the greatest tenderness by ultrasound, thus obtaining more information and data on the pathology than the standard physical examination. In this comprehensive review, we have reported the most relevant indications and advantages to using ultrasound in the investigation of abdominal acute pain."

It is a life-threatening condition and surgical emergency associated with high mortality if not treated promptly. While it is well established that cardiovascular disease recognises different pathophysiological pathways between men and women, there is limited evidence of sex differences in AAS, especially in type A AAD. According to a recent synthesis of clinical studies on gender differences in type A AAD, women were found to have different baseline characteristics, presentation and outcomes, and thus sex should be considered relevant for diagnosis, risk-stratification and management of type A AAD."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain caused by torsion of the pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma is rare. Miss diagnosis can lead to ischemia, necrosis, and subsequent peritonitis which may cause significant morbidity. Torsion of the leiomyoma should be recognized as a surgical emergency and once suspected, early surgical intervention should be considered. A 28-year-old woman with a medical history of uterine leiomyoma presented to our emergency department because of acute onset right lower abdominal pain. The computed tomography was performed which demonstrated multiple leiomyomas of variable sizes and a subserosal leiomyoma located at right lower abdomen with poor contrast enhancement. The gynecologist was consulted, and myomectomy was performed. The intraoperative finding showed a pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma with torsion. She underwent myomectomy for the twisted pedunculated subserosal leiomyoma as well as other leiomyomas and was discharged with a favorable outcome. Torsion of the leiomyoma is a surgical emergency as delayed in treatment may lead to marked morbidity. Once suspected, the gynecologist must be consulted, and surgical intervention should be considered."

We report our experience with a 54-year-old nulliparous woman who underwent emergency surgery for a suspected ruptured ovarian tumor. Intraoperative examination revealed disruption of a cystic tumor that had developed externally from the fundus of the uterus. The patient, who was taking aspirin because of a history of medullary infarction, reported lower abdominal discomfort for several days. When she sought care, she was referred to the gynecology department where transvaginal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a poorly toned mass with a maximum diameter of 20 cm posterior to the uterus. She also had a large amount of ascites reaching around the liver and the spleen. She underwent an emergency laparotomy for a presumed diagnosis of acute abdomen caused by a ruptured ovarian tumor with intra-abdominal bleeding. Intraoperative examination revealed normal adnexae bilaterally, but there was a cystic tumor in the pouch of Douglas that was strongly adherent to the surrounding intestines. This mass was connected to the posterior uterus by a stalk and appeared to be continuous with the uterine tissue. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was carcinosarcoma derived from subserous cystic adenomyosis. This is the first case report of carcinosarcoma developing from subserous cystic adenomyosis in the English literature as far as we know."

    "abstract": "Background The aim of this retrospective study is to establish a correlation between clinical features, surgical diagnosis, and the final diagnosis of laparotomies, as well as to establish the relationship between preoperative delay on the outcomes of surgery in the form of mortality and morbidity. Emergency surgery is high-risk in patients with acute abdomen with uncertain diagnosis. The results of surgery are remarkable and provide quick relief to the suffering and agony of patients with the dreadful condition of acute generalized peritonitis. Methodology Patients presenting with complaints of acute abdomen who needed laparotomy based on clinical judgment and investigations were included in this study. The study data were reviewed from April 2007 to January 2011 and March 2014 to February 2016 in a government hospital. Results A total of 174 patients with acute abdomen in whom there was an indication of laparotomy based on clinical judgment and radiological investigations were selected. Most patients had gastrointestinal perforation (n = 115) and acute intestinal obstruction (n = 23). The most important clinical features analyzed were abdominal tenderness (n = 160), guarding (n = 153), distention (n = 75), and tachycardia (n = 63). Conclusions Among the total patients, 150 underwent surgery within 24 hours of the presentation in the emergency and the remaining after 24 hours. The most common cause of laparotomy was a duodenal perforation in 79 patients and gastric perforation in 24 patients. A total of 114 patients developed no complications postoperatively. Among patients who developed postoperative complications, wound sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome were the most common. Mortality was noted in three patients."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous rapture of a germ cell tumor (GCT) metastases causing massive hemoretroperitoneum in a patient without choriocarcinoma component who has not received previous systemic chemotherapy is an exceedingly rare event. In such a devastating case scenario, a high index of clinical suspicion for early diagnosis and appropriate management is crucial. We report on a 25-year-old male patient with a 4-month history of orchiectomy for testicular GCT (tGCT), who presented in the emergency department with acute abdomen and hemodynamic instability. Urgent computed tomography scan depicted a retroperitoneal mass measuring approximately 13 × 11.4 × 15 cm and massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Hemoperitoneum caused by spontaneous rapture of the metastatic retroperitoneal mass was suspected. COVID-19 pandemic-related deviation from the oncologic surveillance standards combined with COVID-19-related patient's emotional distress and self-neglect had led to loss of opportunity for appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy, obviously leading to the development of this devastating complication. An emergency, surgical exploration was decided. The bleeding mass was adequately exposed following a Cattell-Braasch maneuver and active bleeding was controlled by a challenging resection of approximately 80% of the lymph node mass volume. Pathological evaluation of the specimen revealed teratoma with low volume of yolk sac tumor component and extensive necrosis, findings compatible with the patient's history. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, followed by early start of adjuvant chemotherapy. Two years after the operation the patient is doing well with no evidence of recurrent disease. Massive hemoperitoneum is a devastating event that exceedingly rarely can complicate the clinical course of patients with advanced tGCT. Emergency surgical intervention is usually necessary however, sound judgement and careful surgical techniques are required for a positive and uneventful outcome. During COVID-19 pandemic, first-line medical personnel push their limits further not only to ensure health care services standards but also, to manage unpredictable, life-threatening cancer-related complications, associated with COVID-19-related deviation from appropriate oncologic surveillance and care."

    "abstract": "Pericardial tamponade (PT) early after cardiac surgery is a challenging clinical entity, not infrequently misrecognized and often only detected late in its course. Because the clinical signs of pericardial tamponade can be very unspecific, a high degree of initial suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis. In addition to clinical examination the deployment of imaging techniques is almost always mandatory in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and to initiate any necessary interventions, such as pericardiocentesis or direct cardiac surgical interventions. After a brief overview of how knowledge of PT has developed throughout history, we report on an atypical life-threatening cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgery. A 74-year-old woman was admitted for elective biological aortic valve replacement and aorto-coronary-bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, single vein graft to right coronary artery). On the 10th postoperative day, the patient unexpectedly deteriorated. She rapidly developed epigastric pain radiating to the left upper abdomen, and features of low peripheral perfusion and shock. There were no clear signs of pericardial tamponade either clinically or echocardiographically. Therefore, for further differential diagnosis, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan was performed under clinical suspicion of acute abdomen. Unexpectedly, active bleeding distally from the right coronary anastomosis was revealed. While the patient was prepared for operative revision, she needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which was successful. Intraoperatively, the source of bleeding was located and surgically relieved. The subsequent postoperative course was uneventful. In the first days after cardiac surgery, the occurrence of life-threatening situations, such as cardiac tamponade, must be expected. Especially if the symptoms are atypical, the entire diagnostic armamentarium must be applied to identify the origin of the complaints, which may be cardiac, but also non-cardiac. A high level of suspicion, immediate diagnostic confirmation, and rapid treatment are required to recognize and successfully treat such an emergency (Fig. 5). Pericardial tamponade should always be considered as a complication of cardiac surgery, even when symptoms are atypical. The full range of diagnostic tools must be used to identify the origin of the complaints, which may be cardiac, but also non-cardiac (Fig. 5)."

Patients presenting as a surgical emergency have a prolonged post-operative course with significant morbidity. We present three cases of post-esophagectomy hiatal hernia. Two of the three cases were operated for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and one patient was operated for esophageal leiomyomatosis. Two of the three cases (SCC and esophageal leiomyomatosis) underwent minimally invasive Mckeown's esophagectomy and one case underwent robotic transthoracic Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. All cases underwent contrast enhanced CT (CECT) and were biopsy proven prior to their index surgery. Both cases of SCC had prior neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery while esophageal leiomyomatosis underwent upfront surgery. All three cases have improved symptomatically and are doing well on follow up (case 1 - 12 months, cases 2 and 3 - 3 months).  All three of our cases have different clinical presentation in terms of symptoms, severity, and time duration from index surgery. Two of the three cases underwent emergency surgery and one case which was asymptomatic detected incidentally on surveillance imaging and was managed conservatively. Post-esophagectomy hiatal hernia is a rare entity with varying presentation. The management options in such cases vary depending on the severity of symptoms and time after index surgery. In cases presenting as surgical emergency, successful management depends on prompt detection, early surgery, proper post-operative care, and rehabilitation."

However, limited information exists as to the relationship between severity of illness and nursing skill mix in the intensive care. The aim of this study was to describe the variation in nursing skill mix across different hospital types and to determine if this was associated with severity of illness of critically ill patients admitted to adult intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand. A retrospective cohort study using the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (to provide information on patient demographics, severity of illness, and outcome) and the Critical Care Resources Registry (to provide information on annual nursing staffing levels and hospital type) from July 2014 to June 2020. Four hospital types (metropolitan, private, rural/regional, and tertiary) and three patient groups (elective surgical, emergency surgical, and medical) were examined. The main outcome measure was the proportion of critical care specialist registered nurses (RNs) expressed as a percentage of the full-time equivalent (FTE) of total RNs working within each ICU each year, as reported annually to the Critical Care Resources Registry. Data were examined for 184 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand. During the 6-year study period, 770 747 patients were admitted to these ICUs. Across Australia and New Zealand, the median percentage of registered nursing FTE with a critical care qualification for each ICU (n = 184) was 59.1% (interquartile range [IQR] = 48.9-71.6). The percentage FTE of critical care specialist RNs was highest in private [63.7% (IQR = 52.6-78.2)] and tertiary ICUs [58.1% (IQR = 51.2-70.2)], followed by metropolitan ICUs [56.0% (IQR = 44.5-68.9)] with the lowest in rural/regional hospitals [55.9% (IQR = 44.9-70.0)]. In ICUs with higher percentage FTE of critical care specialist RNs, patients had higher severity of illness, most notably in tertiary and private ICUs. This relationship was persistent across all hospital types when examining subgroups of emergency surgical and medical patients and in multivariable analysis after adjusting for the type of hospital and relative percentage of each diagnostic group. In Australian and New Zealand ICUs, the highest acuity patients are cared for by nursing teams with the highest percentage FTE of critical care specialist RNs. The Australian and New Zealand healthcare system has a critical care nursing workforce which scales to meet the acuity of ICU patients across Australia and New Zealand."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is an emergency condition which necessitates urgent management. Obstruction accounts to the majority of causes of acute abdomen. As acute abdomen can lead to a dramatic and fatal complication, rapid diagnosis and management are utterly important. Sigmoid volvulus is the commonest cause of large bowel obstruction in Africa and particularly in Ethiopia. Left side gallbladder and liver without situs inversus is a very rare clinical finding with few reports in the history of literatures. A 53 years old male patient presented to our emergency department with failure to pass feces and flatus of 6 days duration. He had similar four episodes previously and sigmoid resection-anastomosis was done five years back at a referral hospital. The abdomen was distended to drum like appearance with visible peristalsis and midline previous surgical scar. The distension is more prominent to right upper quadrant resembling a bent inner tube. Upon entering the abdomen, there was 360 degrees clockwise volvulated remnant sigmoid and descending colon. There was small bowel adhesion to abdominal wall which snugs the large bowel at the neck of volvulus. The liver and gallbladder are on the left upper quadrant and right upper quadrant of abdomen is empty. The gallbladder is to the left of the round/falciform ligament. Intestinal obstruction is one of the commonest causes of acute abdomen carrying significant mortality if not intervened timely. Sigmoid volvulus is one of the common causes of large bowel obstruction more happening in the adults and elderly. It is reported that patients with megacolon and mega rectum have risk of recurrence of volvulus even after sigmoid resection. Left side gallbladder without situs inversus is a very rare occurrence and very few reports in the literature to date. Optimal sigmoid resection in sigmoid volvulus and subtotal colectomy when sigmoid volvulus is associated with megacolon and megacolon are said to reduce postoperative volvulus recurrence. Special care and workup should be a priority during cholecystectomy in left-sided gallbladder to avoid biliary tract and vascular injury."

    "abstract": "Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that warrants prompt treatment. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by ultrasonography interpreted by a radiologist (RADUS); however, in this study, we describe the clinical course of 23 patients for whom point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians during the initial assessment for testicular torsion in the pediatric emergency department (PED). A retrospective case series analysis of patients aged 0 to 18 years who were diagnosed with acute testicular torsion after undergoing scrotal POCUS through our PED. Between June 2015 and December 2020, 155 boys received an International Classification of Diseases-9 code of Torsion of Testis after presenting to our PED. Seventy-three patients were imaged preoperatively, of which 50 (68.5%) were diagnosed via RADUS alone. Twenty-three patients (31.5%) underwent POCUS (median age 14.1 years [interquartile range {IQR}: 11.4-15.9 years]), of which 14 (60.9%) were imaged by POCUS alone, whereas the remaining 9 patients (39.1%) underwent POCUS before RADUS. Thirteen of the 23 patients (56.5%) who underwent POCUS had intraoperative findings consistent with acute testicular torsion, whereas another 3 patients (13.0%) required manual detorsion in the PED before orchiopexy. Six patients required orchiectomy. All patients for which POCUS findings were suggestive of acute testicular torsion were correctly classified.The median length of stay from time to admission to orchiopexy for those who received RADUS only versus POCUS only was 184 minutes (IQR: 136-255), and 121 minutes (IQR: 80-202), respectively ( P = 0.036). Among the patients who experienced POCUS, the median length of stay for those who underwent RADUS in addition to POCUS compared with those who underwent POCUS alone was 202 minutes (IQR: 136-338.4) ( P = 0.031). Point-of-care ultrasound performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians can be used to expedite surgical management and streamline the management of pediatric patients suspected of acute testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, and the standard approach to diagnosis and management has been codified in several practice guidelines. Adherence to these guidelines provides insight into independent surgical practice patterns and institutional resource constraints as impediments to best practice. We explored data from the recent ESTES SnapAppy observational cohort study to determine guideline compliance in contemporary practice to identify opportunities to close evidence-to-practice gaps. We undertook a preplanned analysis of the ESTES SnapAppy observational cohort study, identifying, at a patient level, congruence with, or deviation from WSES Jerusalem guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign in our cohort. Compliance was then correlated with the incidence of postoperative complications. Four thousand six hundred and thirteen (4613) consecutive adult and adolescent patients with acute appendicitis were followed from date of admission (November 1, 2020, and May 28, 2021) for 90 days. Patient-level compliance with guideline elements allowed patients to be grouped into those with full compliance (all 5 elements: 13%), partial compliance (1-4 elements: 87%) or noncompliance (0 elements: 0.2%). We identified an excess postoperative complication rate in patients who received noncompliant and partially compliant care, compared with those who received fully guideline-compliant care (36% and 16%, versus 7.3%, p < 0.001). The observed diagnostic and treatment practices of the participating institutions displayed variability in compliance with key recommendations from existing guidelines. In general, practice was congruent with recommendations for preoperative antibiotic surgical site infection prophylaxis administration, time to surgery, and operative approach. However, there remains opportunities for improvement in the choice of diagnostic imaging modality, postoperative antibiotic stewardship to timely discontinue prophylactic antibiotics, and the implementation of ambulatory treatment pathways for uncomplicated appendicitis in the healthy young adult."

Patients commonly perform an internet search for more information prior to undergoing surgery, which can lead to an inappropriate understanding of their procedure. The aim is to assess the quality of information available on three of the most used search engines. A search was conducted on Google.com, Bing.com and Yahoo.com using the terms related to laparoscopic appendicectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, hernia repair and colectomy. First 20 results from each search engine were collected for evaluation. Results were excluded if they were sponsored, duplicates, academic publications, advertisements, forums, audiovisual tools, social media or any non-English information. Included results were assessed for reliability using DISCERN and JAMA benchmark score. Readability was assessed using Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) Score and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG). Hundred and ninety-seven websites were analysed, 44.7% were published by institutions, 34.5% by health websites and 20.8% by independent surgeons. Mean DISCERN scores for Institutions was 54.6 ± 11.3, independent surgeons 45.9 ± 11.4 and health websites 58.7 ± 10.3.

Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha (RIPASA) score has showed promising results in the recent literature. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Alvarado, AIR and RIPASA scores in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Alvarado, AIR and RIPASA scores were prospectively applied to 132 included patients that were admitted with provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis and then their surgery was performed in General Surgery Unit, Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar, Pakistan from 1st January 2022 to 31st July 2022. Final diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology report and scores were correlated with final report. Cut off value of score >7, >5 and >7.5 were set for Alvarado, AIR and RIPASA score, respectively according to previous literature. Statistics analysis was done for all 3 scoring systems on SPSS version 23. Of 132 patients, there were n = 79(59.8%) males and n = 53(40.2%) females. Mean age was 24 years (SD ± 11.6) with youngest patient of 9 years and oldest one was 70 years old. Negative Appendectomy rate was 8.3%(n = 11). RIPASA score was superior to AIR and Alvarado score in Sensitivity, NLR, Accuracy and Area under the Curve. AIR score performed better in specificity, NPV, PLR compared to RIPASA and Alvarado score. RIPASA score is an overall better scoring system in diagnosing acute appendicitis in compared to Alvarado and AIR score."

Investigations led to the diagnosis of hollow viscus perforation, so emergency laparotomy was performed. At the exploration of peritoneal cavity, unexpectedly, a live tapeworm was found in the peritoneal cavity. The perforation was repaired and medication were continued by anthelmintic. He was discharged with good condition. We discuss this rare incidental finding in a patient with bowel perforation and suggest the taeniasis as a possible cause of intestinal perforation. The medical literature and reviews have been searched to find more information about taeniasis and its cause-effect in GI tract complications. Increasing the public knowledge about food hygiene and encouraging eat well-cooked meat can control the cycle of transmission of cestodes. Taeniasis should be considered a possible cause of intestinal obstruction or perforation, especially in endemic areas."

We report the case of an adult male who went to the emergency room due to abdominal pain, presented clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with acute appendicitis but was diagnosed intraoperatively with omental torsion and associated necrosis, which was successfully treated by laparoscopic omentectomy. It is a rare entity with a low incidence. The symptoms of the cases reported in the literature are usually confused with other abdominal pathologies such as appendicitis or cholecystitis, so preoperative diagnosis continues to be a challenge. The treatment of choice is the laparoscopic approach, since it allows confirming the diagnosis, evaluating the severity of the ischemia, and ruling out other surgical pathologies. It is important to consider omental torsion as another differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, which can be satisfactorily resolved via laparoscopy, thus avoiding the development of complications associated with its natural evolution."

This is a retrospective analysis of all consecutive critically ill patients ≥90 years admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care university hospital in Hamburg, Germany. Clinical course and laboratory data were analyzed for all patients. HLI was defined according to established criteria as elevation of aminotransferase levels (>20-fold upper limit of normal). Predictors of HLI occurrence, clinical course, and outcome were assessed and compared to those of patients without HLI. In total, 1,065 critically ill patients ≥90 years were included. During the ICU stay, 3% (n = 35) developed HLI. Main causes of HLI were cardiogenic shock (51%, n = 18), septic shock (23%, n = 8), and cardiac arrest (20%, n = 7). Presenting characteristics including age, gender, and BMI were comparable between patients with and without HLI. The admission cause was primary medical (HLI: 49% vs. No-HLI: 34%, p = 0.07), surgical - planned (9% vs. 38%, p < 0.001), and surgical - emergency (43% vs. 28%, p = 0.06). The median Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the median updated CCI were 2 (1-3) and 2 (1-2) points in patients with HLI and 1 (0-2) and 1 (0-2) in patients without HLI (p < 0.01 and p = 0.08). Patients with HLI presented with higher SAPS II (55 vs. 36 points p < 0.001) score on admission and required mechanical ventilation (66% vs. 34%, p < 0.001), vasopressor therapy (91% vs. 40%, p < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (20% vs. 2%, p < 0.001), and parenteral nutrition (29% vs. 7%, p < 0.001). The ICU mortality and hospital mortality in patients with HLI were 66% (n = 23) and 83% (n = 29) compared with 17% (n = 170) and 28% (n = 292) in patients without HLI, respectively (both p < 0.001). Regression analysis identified SAPS II (OR 1.05, 95% CI: [1.02-1.07]; p < 0.001) and vasopressor therapy (OR 9.21, 95% CI: [2.58-32.86]; p < 0.01) as factors significantly associated with new onset of HLI. Occurrence of HLI was independently associated with mortality (HR 2.23, 95% CI: [1.50-3.30]; p < 0.001). HLI is an uncommon but not rare condition in critically ill patients aged ≥90 years. Occurrence of HLI is associated with high mortality and is mainly caused by cardiogenic or septic shock. HLI may serve as early prognostic marker in critically ill patients aged ≥90 years."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing or severe pancreatitis represents approximately 10%-20% of acute pancreatitis. 30%-40% of patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) will develop debris infection through translocation of intestinal microbial flora. Infected ANP constitutes a serious clinical condition and is complicated by severe sepsis with high mortality rates of up to 40% despite progress in current intensive care. The timely detection of sepsis is crucial. The Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, procalcitonin levels > 1.8 ng/mL and increased lactates > 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL), indicate the need for urgent management. The escalated step-by-step management protocol starts with broad-spectrum antibiotics, percutaneous drainage or endoscopic management, and ends with surgical management if needed. The latter includes necrosectomy (either laparoscopic or traditional open surgery), peritoneal lavage and extensive drainage. This management protocol increases the chance of survival to approximately 60% in patients with otherwise fatal cases. Any treatment choice must be individualized, and the timing is critical."

Radiologists play a key role in the diagnosis and management of this condition and, with a multimodal approach, diagnostic accuracy usually increases. Spontaneous resolution of GI has previously been reported for stones smaller than 2 cm. Gallstones usually require surgical management; however, in patients with comorbidities and at high risk of surgical complications, a conservative approach may be considered. Herein, we report the case of an 84-year-old woman who came to the emergency department with an acute abdomen pain caused by a GI, with a 2.6 cm gallstone that was revealed on computed tomography and which was followed by diagnostic imaging with spontaneous resolution."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is cited as the leading cause of surgical acute abdomen in pediatrics and the most frequent urgent surgical pathology worldwide. For a long time, surgical appendectomy has been effectively used as the first-line treatment for AA. Other conservative management practices, such as the use of antibiotics, have been applied in the treatment of appendicitis. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the surgical treatment strategies of AA in pediatrics, with many pediatric surgeons having to shift from upfront surgical appendectomy to conservative management involving the use of antibiotics as a treatment strategy. This meta-analysis compares the outcomes between appendectomy and conservative therapy in the management of AA during COVID-19 in pediatrics. Twenty-one articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Articles that were published more than five years ago were excluded from the analysis. Also, articles that included studies on the adult population were excluded. Results from various retrospective studies, prospective clinical controlled trials, correlational studies, and randomized clinical trials were analyzed. This study reveals that the use of antibiotics has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis. However, antibiotics have been shown to have some complications. Despite this being the case, the studies identified the potential of using antibiotics as a definitive treatment of uncomplicated AA in pediatrics. Further studies are required to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and recurrence of AA of this alternative treatment method."

Nearly, 2% to 4% of all surgical admissions are a result of LBO. The most common pathological development of LBO remains colonic malignancy, representing approximately 60% of cases. Other etiology includes abdominal adhesions, diverticulosis, hernia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and in rare cases endometriosis. In this report, the patient is a 36-year-old female with an LBO, originally thought to be a complication of diverticulitis. However, it was confirmed that the obstruction was a result of endometriosis tissue adherence to the colonic wall narrowing the intestinal lumen.

Some of the serious complications of FPIES include necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), massive bloody stools, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Here we report a case of NEC caused by FPIES. A 28-day-old girl born at full term suddenly developed marked abdominal distention and shock a few hours after being fed highly regulated milk protein. Emergency laparotomy was performed, and extensive small-intestinal necrosis was found. The histological examination showed chronic inflammation with typical ghost crypts, hemorrhage, and extensive pneumatosis intestinalis, a presentation consistent with NEC. In this case, the fragile intestinal mucosa associated with FPIES was stimulated by milk protein, leading to NEC. The greatest diagnostic difficulty is the lack of a definitive method for distinguishing between NEC and FPIES. The allergen-specific lymphocyte stimulation test with lactotransferrin was positive, indicating that the primary condition was FPIES. However, no eosinophilic infiltrate was found in the histological examination, but there was chronic inflammation with typical ghost crypts, hemorrhage, and extensive pneumatosis intestinalis. Consequently, the final histological diagnosis in our case was NEC rather than FPIES. FPIES has a variable clinical course, and severe FPIES may become exacerbated even after ingestion of highly regulated milk protein. Taking appropriate actions after correct diagnosis can prevent progression to surgical emergency and secondary NEC."

Enterolithiasis i.e. formation of gastrointestinal concretions is an uncommon medical condition that develops in the setting of intestinal stasis due to various pathologies and can present in different clinical pictures to challenge a clinician. a 60-year-old male farmer who had sigmoid resection and anastomosis six years back, currently presented with a complaint of recurrent abdominal cramps, progressive abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation of 08 days duration. An examination showed a distended soft and non-tender abdomen. A plain abdominal x-ray showed an obstruction caused by enteroliths located at the proximal rectum. The patient was diagnosed with large bowel obstruction due to an impacted enterolith at the stenosed previous anastomotic site. Later, the patient was operated on, impacted enteroliths were removed, and was discharged improved. definitive preoperative diagnosis of bowel obstruction due to enterolithiasis is not always possible. A high index of suspicion is very important to avoid misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. Most patients with enterolithiasis can be managed conservatively.

    "abstract": "Background: Gallbladder torsion is a rare cause of an acute abdomen, predominantly occurring in elderly women and less frequently diagnosed in the pediatric population. The diagnosis is difficult and rarely made preoperatively. However, suspicion needs to be raised in children with acute onset of abdominal pain. Ultrasound can demonstrate different signs putting forward the diagnosis but findings are often non-specific, therefore clinical suspicion should prompt a laparoscopic exploration.Case presentation: We report a case of a 12-month old girl consulting with progressive abdominal discomfort and vomiting. Ultrasound revealed an enlarged gallbladder with thickening of the wall but without demonstrable color Doppler flow and a more horizontal orientation outside its normal anatomic fossa. Gallbladder torsion was suspected. Emergency laparoscopic exploration confirmed the diagnosis and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful.Conclusions: Gallbladder torsion, although rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in children. Early recognition is necessary for a favorable outcome. The diagnosis might be supported by ultrasound but remains difficult, which is why laparoscopic exploration should be considered when the diagnosis remains unclear."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous bladder rupture (SBR) is an extremely rare urological emergency. Herein we report a rare case of SBR in a postoperative cervical cancer patient, which was attributable to bladder distension due to a radical hysterectomy-associated neurogenic bladder. A 74-year-old nulliparous Japanese patient with cervical cancer (pT1b3N0M0) presented with acute abdominal pain nine days after a radical hysterectomy. The pretreatment workup included plain computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of ascites in the absence of gastrointestinal perforation. The patient was initially diagnosed with generalized bacterial peritonitis and treated with antibiotics. Urine outflow was noted 5 days later from the vaginal stump. Subsequent contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated a bladder wall defect with presence of contrast medium in the abdominal cavity. The patient was diagnosed with SBR and was conservatively treated with antibiotics and prolonged catheterization (4 weeks); these measures showed no signs of therapeutic efficacy. The patient was subsequently treated surgically with an ileal conduit urinary diversion. The patient is currently free of disease. A literature review revealed that a history of pelvic radiotherapy is the main predisposing factor for SBR in women with cervical cancer. Our case serves to alert physicians that SBR should be considered a differential diagnosis in postoperative cervical cancer patients without a history of pelvic radiotherapy who experience generalized peritonitis symptoms or present as an acute abdomen. SBR can develop in cervical cancer patients without a history of radiotherapy. This differential diagnosis should be considered in patients with a radical hysterectomy-associated neurogenic bladder."

We evaluated the relationship between sex and mortality after emergency abdominal surgery. We performed a retrospective cohort study using the acute care surgery database at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Malawi. We included patients who underwent emergency abdominal surgery between 2013 and 2021. We created a propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards model to assess the relationship between sex and inpatient survival. We included 2052 patients in the study, and 76% were males. The most common admission diagnosis in both groups was bowel obstruction. Females had a higher admission shock index than males (0.91 vs. 0.81, p < 0.001) and a longer delay from admission until surgery (1.47 vs. 0.79 days, p < 0.001). Females and males had similar crude postoperative mortality (16.3% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.621). The final Cox proportional hazards regression model was based on the propensity-weighted cohort. The mortality hazard ratio was 0.65 among females compared to males (95% CI 0.46-0.92, p = 0.014). Our results show a survival advantage among female patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery despite sex-based disparities in access to surgical care that favors males. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings."

Studies have demonstrated that the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions (CPC) is associated with a number of worsening outcomes in hospitalised patients in general. The relationship between a wide range of psychiatric comorbidities and acute surgical presentations has not been studied to date. The Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) system and prospectively maintained eHandover were used to identify all surgical emergency admissions to Mayo University Hospital, Ireland. Patient demographics, comorbidities, primary diagnoses, length of stay (LoS), and procedures undergone were recorded over a 12-months period. Subgroup analyses examining LoS variation in surgical presentation types were performed. 1028 admissions occurred over this one year period, amongst 995 patients, the presence of psychiatric comorbidities increased the mean LoS by 1.9 days (p = 0.002). Comorbid depression, dementia, and intellectual disability conferred a significant increase in LoS by 2.4 days, 2.8 days and 6.7 days respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed greater LoS in patients with CPC diagnosed with non-specific abdominal pain (1.4 days, p = 0.019), skin and soft tissue infections (2.5 days, p = 0.040), bowel obstruction (4.3 days, p = 0.047), and medical disorders (18.6 days, p = 0.010). No significant difference was observed in mortality and readmission rates. Psychiatric comorbidities significantly impact length of hospital stay and discharge planning in surgical inpatients. Greater awareness of this can facilitate better care delivery for this population to reduce the LoS and subsequent economic burden on the healthcare system."

Synchronous colorectal cancer refers to more than one malignant tumor detected in different segments of the colon, simultaneously or within 6 months of initial diagnosis. The development of colorectal cancer is a multistep process that originates with a genetic mutation leading to a malignant phenotype and generating a growth advantage. Colorectal cancer presents up to 16% of hypermutations, of which 75% are characterized by microsatellite instability which in turn leads to poorer cell differentiation. Patients with synchronous tumors appear to have a higher proportion of microsatellite instability than patients with single tumors. The clinical case of a 35-year-old man with a perforated left colon tumor and a locally advanced synchronous tumor of the right colon and signs of acute abdomen is presented. The treatment should be based on the location of the synchronous tumors, stage at the time of approach, and the patient's condition. However, when faced with a complication secondary to colonic cancer, adhering to the principles of oncological surgery can be overcome by the nature of the emergency."

In the present study, we aimed to compare the prediction accuracy of 3 scoring systems: Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II, sequential organ failure assessment score and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II). The retrospective cohort study was conducted in a university hospital. Eighty-two acute mesenteric ischemia patients were evaluated retrospectively. The mortality prediction abilities of the scoring systems were evaluated by comparing the prediction rates of > 10%, 30% and 50% and the actual mortality among survivors and non-survivors in pairs. Predicted mortality rates among survivors and non-survivors differed among the 3 classification systems. The mortality estimates of the SAPS II were closer to the actual mortality rates. Analysis of the estimated mortality rates as mortality risk limits showed that acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II was superior to sequential organ failure assessment score and SAPS II in estimating mortality rates, whereas SAPS II was more successful in detecting survivors.

Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment, still burdened by a risk of intraoperative biliary duct injury. An alternative strategy to manage patients with severe acute cholecystitis is the percutaneous gallbladder drainage (PGBD). The Italian Society of Emergency Surgery and Trauma performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim to clarify controversies about the preoperative use of PGBD. We extracted 32 studies: 9 Randomized Control Trial Studies (RCTs) and 23 no RCTs. The incidence of post-operative complications was lower in the PGBD associated at LC than in the LC alone (RCTs: RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.56, I2 = 63%). The incidence of the post-operative biliary leakage was higher in late PGBD' group (RCTs: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.80). The incidence of intraabdominal abscess, blood loss, conversion to open, subtotal cholecystectomy, operative time and wound infection was lower in PGBD' group. The total hospital stay was the same. A strong recommendation is performed to the use of the PGBD + LC than upfront LC to reduce biliary leakage (recommendation \"strong positive\") in high risk acute cholecystitis especially in patients with higher perioperative risks or longstanding acute cholecystitis. For post-operative complications a recommendation \"positive weak\" suggests that PGBD + LC could be used than upfront LC to reduce the rate of post-operative complications."

    "abstract": "In patients with acute abdomen, especially during pregnancy, it is difficult to suspect myoma torsion initially due to its rarity. However, when these patients have a solid mass in the pelvis, torsion of uterine fibroids or adnexa and large infarct inside leiomyoma are the main diagnoses that must be differentiated. We report a case of uterine myoma torsion mimicking ovarian torsion in the second trimester of pregnancy that was successfully managed by laparoscopic myomectomy. A 31-year-old pregnant woman with severe right lower abdominal pain at 21 + 2 weeks of gestation was transferred. On ultrasonography, the appendix appeared normal but a solid mass (7.0×4.0 cm) containing a cystic portion was observed on the right side of the uterus. The mass had no blood flow and tenderness appeared on the transducer pressure. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 7 cm edematous mass with low signal intensity on T2-weighted image, instead of a normal-looking right ovary. These findings led to suspicion of right ovarian torsion. One day after admission, the patient's symptoms worsened with acute elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) (4.55 mg/dL) and neutrophile-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (10.1), despite the use of analgesics and tocolytics, and uterine contractions were not controlled. Emergency surgery was performed, and the final diagnosis was a uterine leiomyoma torsion. Laparoscopic myomectomy was successfully performed, and symptoms were relieved after operation. She had full term vaginal delivery without complication. The differential diagnosis between myoma torsion and ovarian torsion is challenging in patients with acute abdomen during pregnancy. To exclude ovarian torsion, a comparison with an asymptomatic contralateral normal ovary will be very helpful. When fibroids are found in mothers with an acute abdomen, follow-up of NLR and CRP is related to preterm labor and can be a reference point for considering surgery."

    "title": "Assessing Clinical Acumen in Predicting Acute Appendicitis in Emergency Surgery: A Prospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Clinical acumen and experience are critical in the diagnosis of the commonest surgical emergency, acute appendicitis. However, there is an increasing focus on haematological and radiological parameters in reaching the diagnosis of appendicitis, which can negate the importance of clinical findings. The aim was to assess the accuracy of each grade of the surgical team in diagnosing acute appendicitis using clinical acuity alone and compare them to each other as well as validated predictive scores. A prospective single-centre study was performed over a six-month period (Dec 2020-May 2021). All patients presenting to the emergency department with right iliac fossa pain were included. A total of 180 patients were included of whom 35% were male. Mean age was 36.2 years (range 16-91). 51.1% had a final diagnosis of appendicitis, of which 91.3% were managed surgically and 8.7% were treated conservatively with antibiotics. Consultants were correct in their prediction of appendicitis in 84.6% of cases (females-83.4%, males-86.6%). Registrars accurately predicted appendicitis in 82.2% of patients (females-80.3%, males-85.7%), whilst house officers (SHOs) and interns were right in 73.8% (females-69.2%, males-82.5%) and 72.7% (females-66.6%, males-83.9%) of cases, respectively. In patients with a histological or radiological diagnosis of appendicitis, the mean Acute Inflammatory Response Score and Acute Appendicitis Score were 7.0 (high risk ≥ 9) and 12.5 (high risk ≥ 16), respectively. Clinicians had superior diagnostic accuracy when compared with both the clinical scores used. Seniority was associated with improved diagnostic accuracy in clinically predicting acute appendicitis. This study showed that the clinical judgement of experienced surgeons is more reliable than clinical scores in the diagnosis of appendicitis."

Its presentation can range from an asymptomatic state to hemorrhagic fever with shock signs. Acute pancreatitis could be a rare form of acute abdomen presentation associated with dengue virus infection. This case illustrates a 26-year-old man who presents to the hospital with cramp-like pain in the epigastrium and radiation to the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He also endorsed additional symptoms such as throbbing-like headache, myoarthralgias, and fever of 40.4°C (104.72°F). Laboratory tests revealed elevated hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, elevated pancreatic enzymes, transaminitis, elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed hepatic steatosis, free fluid in the abdominal cavity, and small bilateral pleural effusions. Additional testing revealed IgM and IgG antibodies positivity to dengue virus. The patient was treated conservatively with intravenous (IV) fluid hydration and bowel rest. Acute pancreatitis should be considered when a patient presents with a suspected acute abdomen in the emergency department, and a detailed medical history is necessary to make a correct approach to the differential diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain in the emergency department and the most common surgical emergency reason for children younger than 15 years of age, which could be enormously dangerous when ruptured. The choice of radiological approach is very important for the diagnosis. In this way, unnecessary surgery is avoided. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria for radiological imaging in diagnosing acute appendicitis with multivariate decision criteria. In our study, pediatric patients who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain were grouped according to the Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score and the choice of radiological examinations was evaluated with fuzzy-based Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) and with the fuzzy-based Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model for the validation of the results. As a result of this study, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) was recommended as the first choice for patients with low AIR score (where Φnet=0.0733) and with high AIR scores (where Φnet=0.0702) while ultrasound (US) examination was ranked third in patients with high scores. While computed tomography is at the forefront with many criteria used in the study, it is still a remarkable practice that US examination is in the first place in daily routine. Even though there are studies showing the strengths of these tools, this study is unique in that it provides analytical ranking results for this complex decision-making issue and shows the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative for different scenarios, even considering vague information for the acute appendicitis diagnosis in children for different scenarios."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a surgical emergency that must be diagnosed promptly in order to avoid serious consequences or death. Additionally, symptoms of this condition are similar to less severe skin and soft tissue infections such as cellulitis or erysipelas and can be easily confused. In this case, the patient presented to the emergency department with systemic symptoms, notably malaise and generalized weakness. A cutaneous complaint, a \"labial cyst\", was only elicited after more specific questioning. Laboratory investigations revealed abnormal renal function tests (RFTs), suggestive of an acute kidney injury. An abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) showed gas in the subcutaneous tissue. These findings led to clinical suspicion of NF, prompting a general surgery consultation. The surgeon proceeded to perform extensive debridement following the discovery of necrotic tissue. The prompt diagnosis and treatment of this condition resulted in patient survival and expected recovery. It is, therefore, critical to keep this condition in mind when diagnosing apparent skin and soft tissue infections presenting with abnormal RFTs due to the possibility of rapid decline and death if the NF is left untreated. Additionally, this is a case of less frequent Fournier's gangrene in a non-diabetic female. Finally, it underlines the importance of eliciting additional symptoms, even those that may seem unrelated, or less concerning, to the patient's initial complaint."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency. This study aimed to estimate the worldwide burden and trends of appendicitis from 1990 to 2019. Data on appendicitis were derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2019. Incidence and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) data were analyzed at global, regional, and national levels and stratified by sex, age, and socio-demographic index. The estimated annual percentage change and relative change were used to assess changing trends. Pearson's correlation test was used to assess the correlation between different measures. Global incidence grew by 63.55% between 1990 and 2019, age-standardized incidence rate climbed by an estimated percentage change of 0.58 per year, whereas the number of DALY declined by 31.93% during the same period, with an estimated annual percentage change of -2.77. In 2019, the areas of Andean Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest age-standardized rates of incidence and DALYs. While South Asia saw the largest increase in age-standardized incidence rates, Andean Latin America saw the biggest decline in age-standardized rates of incidence and DALYs. At the national level, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Peru were the top three countries in terms of age-standardized incidence rates in 2019, and Honduras, Haiti, and the Central African Republic held the highest age-standardized DALY rates. Ethiopia experienced the most age-standardized incidence rate increase, and Peru saw the largest decline in age-standardized rate of incidence and DALYs. Significant negative correlations between age-standardized DALY rates and socio-demographic index, between estimated annual percentage change and age-standardized incidence rates, were observed at the national level. Appendicitis remains a major global health concern. Although the trends in DALYs decreased, the burden of incidence increased from 1990 to 2019. Policymakers should create health policies adapted to local conditions to manage the burden of appendicitis globally."

    "abstract": "Intrauterine testicular torsion is extremely rare and the exact cause remains largely unknown. It is the result of an ischemic insult intrauterine, which presents as either extra-vaginal or intravaginal testicular torsion. Urgent surgical exploration and fixating the contralateral testis is key in the management of this condition. We present here the case of a two-day old neonate with in-born right scrotal swelling admitted at Children's hospital. The patient was born at term via cesarean section at a private hospital. Upon arrival in the emergency department, he was well hydrated, pink at room temperature with good perfusion. Upon examination, the right testis was found to be enlarged, tense, non-tender visibly reddish with overlying skin excoriation. Trans-illumination was negative in right but positive in the contralateral testis. Both hernial orifices were normal. Doppler ultrasound of the inguinoscrotal area found the right testis to be enlarged (15.6*9.4 mm) and showed heterogeneous hypoechoic texture with prominent rete testis and no flow on color doppler analysis. An urgent scrotal exploration was undertaken. Intra-operatively there was frank necrotic right testis with intravaginal torsion of the testis and minimal hydrocele. A right orchidectomy and contralateral orchidopexy were performed. Intrauterine testicular torsion should be treated as a surgical emergency. We advocate early recognition of intrauterine testicular torsion, alongside surgical exploration and simultaneous contralateral orchidopexy."

    "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy occurs in 2% of all pregnancies. A primary ovarian ectopic (OP) is a rare entity and occurs in <2% of all ectopic gestations. It may present in those individuals who take ovulatory drugs, use an intrauterine device or have undergone in vitro fertilisation or embryo transfer. Multiparity and a younger age are other recognised risk factors. Diagnosing an OP pregnancy remains a challenge and it may be misdiagnosed as a bleeding luteal cyst, a haemorrhagic ovarian cyst or a tubal pregnancy by ultrasound scan. The diagnosis is often only established at laparoscopy following histopathological examination. A ruptured OP is a potentially life-threatening condition due to its potential for haemorrhage and hemodynamic collapse. Hence, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her late 30s presenting with a seizure and lower abdominal pain at 6 weeks gestation. Her beta human chorionic gonadotropin was >9000 Miu/mL. A transvaginal ultrasound scan showed no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy. There was free fluid in the pelvis. She was hemodynamically stable. She underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, which showed hemoperitoneum and a ruptured left OP pregnancy. She underwent a left oophorectomy. Histology confirmed chorionic villi within the ovarian stroma. This case demonstrates the challenges in preoperative diagnosis of a ruptured OP pregnancy and acts as a cautionary reminder that individuals can present with hemodynamic stability. Rarely, as in this case, an OP pregnancy can occur without the presence of risk factors. Despite its rarity, a ruptured OP pregnancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women of reproductive age presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and a positive pregnancy test."

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)is a multisystem autoimmune disease, characterized by clinical heterogeneity, ranging from mild to severe, life-threatening manifestations. Although gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequently encountered during disease course (mainly associated with complications of medication or infection), primary GI involvement due to SLE is rare. Among variable presentations, lupus abdominal serositis (defined as peritonitis if accompanied by symptoms and signs of acute abdomen) and lupus enteritis/mesenteric vasculitis are causes of SLE-related acute abdominal pain. They occur, although not always, in the context of high disease activity and prompt diagnosis and treatment is necessary due to their potential severe complications. However, the diagnosis of these manifestations remains challenging even for experts, especially in cases of \"organ-dominant\" lupus flares. Exclusion of these rare manifestations from classification criteria increases the likelihood of misdiagnosis and highlights the inherent limitations of classification criteria when the latter are used for diagnosis. Urgent abdominal computed tomography can lead to a prompt diagnosis of these lupus manifestations, especially characteristic for lupus mesenteric vasculitis. Herein, we describe four cases of patients with lupus flare, presenting with acute abdominal manifestations and highlight the potential complexity of diagnostic approach in such situations."

Gynecologic conditions are an uncommon etiology of abdominal compartment syndrome. We report a case of a 35-year-old woman who presented with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient had a history of long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease. On physical examination, the abdomen was distended and tense, suggestive of acute abdomen. Computed tomography revealed a large abdominopelvic cystic lesion, arising from the ovary, causing a significant pressure effect on the abdominal viscera. The patient's condition deteriorated and had an altered level of consciousness with hemodynamic instability. She was intubated and received inotropic support. Subsequently, a life-saving emergency surgical decompression was performed. The ovarian cyst was evacuated and yielded 10 liters of fluid. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ovarian cystadenoma. The patient remained in the intensive care unit postoperatively and was discharged in a good condition after 14 days of hospitalization. The case emphasizes the importance of considering abdominal compartment syndrome in patients with a clinical picture of acute abdomen. Failure to recognize this condition can lead to multiorgan failure and death."

Cecal wall necrosis is not usually included in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis, mainly because of the rare nature of the condition and the relatively low level of awareness among surgeons. We present a case of isolated cecal wall necrosis presenting as acute appendicitis. It involves a 42-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department (ED) of our hospital with abdominal pain for three days. The pain was felt over the right lower quadrant and was associated with nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. The case was diagnosed as acute appendicitis and the patient was taken to the operating room (OR). Upon entering the abdomen, necrosis of the anterolateral wall of the cecum was discovered with a normal appendix. Resection of the cecum was performed, followed by ileocolic anastomosis. The patient was discharged in good condition after 10 days of hospital stay. This case report highlights the importance of considering cecal wall necrosis in patients presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain who display atypical signs and symptoms of appendicitis; we also wish to promote awareness among surgeons about this rare condition."

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis in pediatrics is challenging and requires an accurate physical examination, laboratory study, and imaging. The aim of this study was to determine the benefits of using three inflammatory markers, white blood count (WBC), neutrophils percent (NE%), and C-reactive protein (CRP), in ruling out appendicitis in pediatric patients. Methods A retrospective study was conducted of 152 pediatric patients aged between 6 months and 14 years presenting to the emergency department between January 2018 and December 2020, with the diagnosis of appendicitis as the primary physician's main diagnosis. Demographic information and clinical data were extracted from the medical file for each patient. Results Out of the 152 patients included, 68 (44.7%) were female and 84 (55.3%) were male, with median age was 8.1 years. Thirty-six (23.7%) had acute appendicitis confirmed by histopathology. Of these 36 patients, only two patients (5.6%) had all inflammatory markers within normal limits. Conclusion  Although raised inflammatory markers may help diagnose acute appendicitis, their role in ruling it out remains limited."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency, but its aetiology is not fully understood. We and others have proposed that allergic responses play significant roles in its pathophysiology. Eosinophils and Interleukin (IL)-5 are involved in a hypersensitivity type I reaction. Eosinophil infiltration is common in the allergic target organ and is dependent on IL-5. In the presence of an allergic component, it is expected that the eosinophil count and IL-5 local and systemic concentrations become elevated. To address this hypothesis, we designed a prospective study that included 65 patients with acute appendicitis (grouped as acute phlegmonous or gangrenous according to the histological definition) and 18 patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, but with normal histological findings (control group) were enrolled. Eosinophil blood counts and appendicular wall eosinophil infiltration were determined. IL-5 levels in blood and appendicular lavage fluid were evaluated. Appendicular lavage fluid was collected by a new methodology developed and standardized by our group. Appendicular wall eosinophil infiltration was higher in acute phlegmonous appendicitis than in gangrenous appendicitis (p = 0.000). IL-5 blood levels were similar in both pathologic and control groups (p > 0.05). In the appendicular lavage fluid, the higher levels of IL-5 were observed in the phlegmonous appendicitis group (p = 0.056). We found a positive correlation between the appendicular wall eosinophilic infiltration and the IL-5 concentrations, in both the blood and the appendicular lavage fluid, supporting the IL-5 reliance in eosinophil local infiltration. We observed the highest presence of eosinophils at phlegmonous appendicitis walls. In conclusion, the present data are compatible with a hypersensitivity type I allergic reaction in the target organ, the appendix, during the phlegmonous phase of appendicitis."

One-fourth of neonates with obstruction suffer postoperative complications, with high mortality, especially in low-income countries. Factors attributed to mortality include prematurity, late presentation and associated multiple congenital anomalies. The prevalence and the predictors of mortality in our setting have not been well studied. We aimed to describe the early postoperative outcomes and to determine the predictors of mortality among neonates with bowel obstruction. We conducted a prospective cohort study during 4 months, when we recruited postoperative neonates from the pediatric surgery unit of Mulago Hospital. We collected data on demographics, clinical presentations, maternal characteristics, the surgical procedure performed, postoperative outcomes, etc. After follow-up for 2 weeks, we analyzed the data using Cox proportional hazards regression models of predictors of mortality. A total of 76 neonates were recruited, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.2:1. The age ranged from 1 to 26 days, a median of 3 [interquartile range (IQR): 2, 7]. About 67.1% had birth weights ranging between 2.5 kg and 3.5 kg, a mean of 2.8 [standard deviation(SD)=0.64]; 76.3% were termed; with anorectal malformation (ARM), 31.6% as the leading cause, followed by jejunoileal atresia (JIA), 25%. Nearly 55.3% of neonates developed complications; 53.9% with post-operative fever, 15.8% had wound sepsis. The mortality rate was 44.7% (34/76) and was highest among cases of JIA, 41.2%. The predictors of mortality included prematurity, fever at admission, breastfeeding status, and mother's parity as well as the cadre of healthcare providers (p<0.005). ARM is the predominant cause of bowel obstruction among neonates, followed by JIA. The morbidity and mortality due to bowel obstruction among neonates are unacceptably high.

A 62 years-old African American patient who presented with severe sudden onset difficulty breathing two days following laparoscopic toupet fundoplication procedure. She was given oxygen via cannula and the underwent chest tube insertion. She was then transferred to different facility under care of a cardio thoracic surgeon. Although SBO is most common emergency following an abdominal procedure, pneumothorax is rarely reported. This case report depicts a unique presentation of pneumothorax secondary to SBO and a discussion section conferring complication risk versus benefits of diverse management modalities (surgical or conservative), and a review of recent literature, further aiding healthcare professionals in the diagnosis and management of patients with SBO complications. Review of this case and the literature show a rare presentation of secondary pneumothorax following exploratory laparotomy for SBO. Recognizing the clinical signs and even a small suspicion should prompt one to order imaging. Chest X-ray is inexpensive and can rapidly rule out pneumothorax. These complications have high mortality in patients above the age of 60 years, hence, timely management is of utmost importance."

The Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify patients 0-18 years (excluding newborns) with malrotation and midgut volvulus from 2010 to 2014. Demographics, procedures, and outcomes were compared by income group (highest quartile vs. lowest quartile) using standard statistical tests. Results were weighted for national estimates. Emergency surgery for midgut volvulus was performed in 572 patients. The majority (86%) underwent Ladd's procedure, while 14% required bowel resection and/or ostomy. Patients in the lowest income quartile were more likely to require bowel resection (18% vs. 8%, p = 0.03) or ostomy (9% vs. 2%, p = 0.015) compared to those in the highest income quartile. Low-income patients were more likely to experience prolonged hospital stay (8 [5-13] days vs. 6 [4-8] days, p<0.001) and experience complications including infections (19% vs. 5%, p = 0.002), endotracheal intubation (18% vs. 4%, p<0.001), and blood transfusions (13% vs. 3%, p = 0.003). Income disparity represents a major factor in surgical outcomes in children with midgut volvulus. A broad spectrum of clinical outcomes following surgery for midgut volvulus exists. Patients from lower-income communities are at significantly higher risk for numerous complications, negative outcomes, and higher resource utilization. These findings support additional investigations of practices to mitigate risk for low-income patients. Level III: Retrospective comparative study."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressing infection of the soft tissues associated with high morbidity and mortality and hence it is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis and treatment are of paramount importance. LRINEC (Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis) and SIARI (Site other than lower limb, Immunosuppression, Age, Renal impairment, and Inflammatory markers) scoring systems have been established for early and accurate diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. This study compared the two scoring systems for diagnosing NF, predicting management, and elucidating the prognostic performance for re-operation and mortality. This prospective study was conducted in PGIMER Chandigarh, India, between February 2020 and June 2021. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (No. INT/IEC/2020-90). The clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, and imaging were used to classify patients into NF or severe cellulitis groups. We also calculated the LRINEC and SIARI scores. Demographic variables and mortality were recorded. The area under the receiver operating characteristic was used to express the accuracy of both scores at a cut-off LRINEC and SIARI scores of ≥6 and ≥ 4, respectively. The study comprised 41 patients with NF and 11 with severe cellulitis. Informed written consent was taken from all the participants. At LRINEC score ≥6, the C-statistic for NF diagnosis was 0.839 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.682-0.995, P 0.001), which was better than SIARI score at ≥ 4, C-statistic of 0.608 (95% CI 0.43-0.787, P 0.297). Both scores accurately predicted 30-day mortality. The LRINEC score showed a C-statistic of 0.912 (95% CI 0.798-1, P 0.001).

    "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine and assess the basic demographic characteristics and prevalence of comorbidities in acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and its various subtypes. A literature search was conducted by using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar (to June 1, 2022). Random-effects or fixed-effects models were selected to pool means and proportions and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), based on heterogeneity between studies. The results of meta-analyses for basic demographic characteristics and prevalence (proportions) of each specific comorbidities of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and its various subtypes were described. Ninety-nine studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 17,103 patients with AMI. Furthermore, 7941 patients with subclass diagnoses of AMI were identified, including 3,239 patients with arterial occlusive mesenteric ischemia (AOMI), 2,977 patients with nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), and 1,725 patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). As a surgical emergency, AMI is associated with older patients and a high likelihood of multisystem comorbidities. Comorbidities of AMI involved multiple systemic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, endocrine and metabolic diseases, kidney diseases, digestive diseases, respiratory diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, vascular diseases, and cancer. The basic demographic characteristics and the prevalence of comorbidities of different subtypes of AMI are different. The management of comorbidities should be an essential part of improving the prognosis of AMI patients and may contribute to precise prevention of AMI."

An emergency case of spontaneous rupture of IMTUB was reported. A 57-year-old middle-aged woman was admitted to the hospital because of \"acute lower abdominal pain for 5 hours\". No history of smoking and gross hematuria. The physical examination revealed visible abdominal tenderness as well as signs of shock. A pelvic CT scan shows a space-occupying lesion above the bladder with massive accumulation of blood. When the nature of the tumor could not be determined, emergency laparotomy and partial cystectomy were performed, and postoperative pathology confirmed cystitis myofibroblastic tumor. No local recurrence or distant metastasis of the tumor was observed during the regular follow-up period of 6 months. IMTUB should focus on prevention and treatment, with a combination of preoperative examination and postoperative pathology, and finally implement highly individualized treatment."

Giant HOCs are rare, as bleeding inside a closed space causes acute pain leading to early diagnosis. Anovulation or oligoovulation is a defining feature of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and hence, functional cysts are uncommon in PCOS patients. This report describes a young girl with PCOS and amenorrhea, presenting with a giant hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. Most hemorrhagic cysts undergo spontaneous resolution with follow-up. Our patient presented as a surgical emergency following torsion and rupture with hemoperitoneum. Torsion causes an obstruction in the blood flow leading to infarction and loss of ovarian viability.

The aim of this study was to investigate the diseases frequently detected in elderly patients diagnosed with acute abdomen in the emergency department, the imaging methods used in the diagnostic processes of these diseases, and the prognosis of the patients. In all, 175 patients who visited the emergency department due to abdominal pain and were hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute abdomen were evaluated. The patients were categorized into seven groups according to their diagnosis as biliary diseases, pancreatitis, appendicitis, gastrointestinal system perforation, ileus, mesenteric ischemia, and atypical causes. The mean age of the patients was 76.3±7.7 years (range 65-93), and 96 (54.9%) were women. The most common causes of acute abdomen were biliary diseases and pancreatitis. Ultrasonography (88.6%) was the most frequently preferred imaging method in the emergency department, and it was most frequently used for biliary diseases. Notably, 20 (11.4%) patients were treated in the intensive care unit, and 9 (5.1%) patients died. The most common causes of acute abdomen in the geriatric population were biliary diseases and pancreatitis, and ultrasonography imaging was the most common choice for the diagnosis of these diseases.

Ultrasound is the imaging tool of choice, but its use is complicated due to anatomical changes during pregnancy and depends on the clinician's expertise. In this study, our aim was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in suspected appendicitis in pregnant women. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all pregnant women undergoing POCUS for suspected appendicitis between June 2010-June 2020 in a tertiary emergency department. The primary outcome was to establish sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of POCUS in diagnosing acute appendicitis, overall and for each trimester. We used histology of the appendix as the reference standard in case of surgery. If appendectomy was not performed, the clinical course until childbirth was used to rule out appendicitis. If the patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we compared readings to POCUS. A total of 61 women were included in the study, of whom 34 (55.7%) underwent appendectomy and in 30 (49.2%) an acute appendicitis was histopathologically confirmed. Sensitivity of POCUS was 66.7% (confidence interval [CI] 95% 47.1-82.7), specificity 96.8% (CI 95% 83.3-99.9), and positive likelihood ratio 20.7. Performance of POCUS was comparable in all trimesters, with highest sensitivity in the first trimester (72.7%). The MRI reading showed a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 100%. In the four negative appendectomies a MRI was not performed. Point-of-care ultrasound showed a high specificity and positive likelihood ratio in diagnosing acute appendicitis in pregnant women in all trimesters with suspected appendicitis. In negative (or inconclusive) cases further imaging as MRI could be helpful to avoid negative appendectomy."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide. Abraham Groves performed the first documented open appendectomy in 1883. Although appendectomy is still the most effective treatment in cases of acute appendicitis, it causes a range of complications and carries the risk of negative appendectomy. In the awake of covid-19, the latest guidelines recommend antibiotic therapy as an acceptable first line treatment for acute appendicitis. However, patients treated with antibiotics have a recurrence risk of up to 30% at 1 year. Endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy (ERAT) has emerged as promising non-invasive treatment modality for acute uncomplicated appendicitis (AUA) which involves cannulation, appedicography, appendiceal stone extraction, appendiceal lumen irrigation, and stent insertion. ERAT aims to relieve the cause of appendicitis (e.g., obstruction or stenosis of the appendiceal lumen) and thus effectively prevent the recurrence of appendicitis. In addition, it can make a definitive diagnosis of acute appendicitis during endoscopic retrograde appendicography. Studies have shown that 93.8 to 95% of AUA patients did not have a recurrence following ERAT. In this study, we aim to summarize the current body of evidence on ERAT to situate it alongside currently established therapies for acute appendicitis, in particular, AUA."

We report a right paraduodenal hernia in a 37-year-old female patient who presented to the ED complaining of abdominal pain located in the right lower abdomen and hypogastrium, accompanied by nausea. During diagnostic work up, the abdominal computed tomography scan revealed the presence of small bowel malrotation with concomitant right paraduodenal hernia. These findings were confirmed intraoperatively. We performed a brief literature review about the clinical manifestations and treatment options of right paraduodenal hernias, which retrieved only 30 articles related to this condition. Prompt diagnosis, radiological or intraoperative, of paraduodenal hernias is crucial because nearly 50% will progress to small bowel obstruction. Therefore, it is essential for every clinician to account for them in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in the ED."

Surgery is the only treatment option, which can be performed laparoscopically or via conventional laparotomy. The present study aimed to compare the short-term outcomes of laparoscopy and laparotomy techniques in the surgical treatment of peptic ulcer perforation. A retrospective study design was structured to compare the perioperative and short-term postoperative outcomes of 102 patients who had undergone laparoscopic and conventional repair of the perforated peptic ulcer over a six-year interval (January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021). Of these, 44 (43.1%) had undergone laparoscopic repair while 58 (56.9%) had surgical repair via conventional laparotomy. The operative time and length of hospital stay were comparable in both subgroups (p=0.984 and p =0.585). Nevertheless, 30-day postoperative morbidity was significantly higher in the open surgery subgroup (75.9% vs. 59.1%, p= 0.032). The risk of relaparotomy was similar in both study subgroups; however, suture dehiscence as a reason for surgical revision was significantly more frequent in the laparoscopic subgroup (13.6% vs 3.4%). Of note, the mortality rate in the laparoscopic group of patients was 13.6%, and in the laparotomy group 41.4%. The laparoscopic approach to peptic ulcer perforation is the procedure of choice for low-risk patients. Conventional surgery seems to be associated with a significantly higher incidence of severe postoperative complications and mortality. However, the higher mortality in these patients is probably related to their worse initial clinical condition."

CASE REPORT A 40-year-old man with complicated Behcet's disease, treated with high-dose steroids, presented with acute abdomen and CT scan findings highly suggestive of intestinal obstruction due to ileocolic intussusception. He underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. Pathology demonstrated PCC disease. CONCLUSIONS Pneumatosis cystoides coli can present with a broad range of symptoms and can be secondary to many systemic and autoimmune diseases. With radiological evidence and a high level of suspicion, unnecessary surgery can be prevented."

    "title": "The Cause of an Unusual Abdominal Pain in Children: Splenic Torsiyon - Three Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Splenic torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain that may develop due to laxity or absence of the ligaments that stabilize the spleen. A torsioned spleen may present with an acute abdomen clinically and may require urgent surgical intervention. We aimed to discuss three pediatric cases who applied to our clinic with acute abdomen symptoms after splenic torsion and their treatment approaches. Case 1: A 10-year-old female patient presented with complaints of progressive abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting. On examination, there was abdominal tenderness and palpable fullness in the left lower quadrant. Imaging methods were compatible with splenic torsion. Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. Case 2: A 4-year-old girl presented with complaints of abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting. On examination, diffuse tenderness in the abdomen and defense-rebound were positive. Imaging methods were compatible with splenic torsion. On exploration, it was observed that the spleen was torsioned in different directions around the double pedicle. Splenectomy was performed. Case 3: A 5-year-old male patient was operated in another hospital with the complaint of abdominal pain, with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, with open surgery. However, there was no improvement in the patient's symptoms after surgery. The patient was consulted to our clinic on the 5th post-operative day. Imaging methods were found to be compatible with splenic torsion. Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. In the pediatric population, splenic torsion can cause acute or chronic abdominal pain of unknown cause. Splenopexy should be the first goal of treatment in torsion, but splenectomy is the only treatment option in complicated cases and laparoscopy can be used safely even in complicated cases."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal tumors that originate from the gastrointestinal tract wall. Approximately 20-30 % of GISTs originate from the small intestine. GISTs of the small intestine generally present with a palpable mass, distention, and abdominal pain and may exhibit acute abdomen at the onset. Herein, we describe a rare case of a pedunculated GIST of the small intestine complicated by torsion. A 69-year-old woman presented with lower abdominal pain. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 73 × 62 × 57-mm3 tumor in the pelvic cavity with enhanced margins and reduced contrast. It was presumed that the tumor had caused hemorrhagic infarction. Emergency laparotomy was performed, and the pedunculated tumor was found to be twisted 360° clockwise at the pedicle with hemorrhage and necrosis due to torsion. We performed partial resection of the small intestine including the tumor. Histopathological examination revealed tightly arranged spindle-shaped cells with hemorrhage, congestion, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CD34, CD117, and DOG1. Torsion of a pedunculated small intestine GIST, although very rare, requires emergency surgery and should be recognized as a cause of acute abdomen in patients with GIST. Immediate surgery is mandatory if torsion of a small intestinal GIST is suspected because the GIST or intestine may become necrotic owing to hemorrhagic infarction."

Although the characteristic features of the normal and diseased appendix had been reported for many previous centuries, it was still the most common challenge facing every single day in the operation room. The appendectomy, the commonest surgical emergency procedure, may cause little confusion for the surgeons due to highly variable situations of inside the abdominal cavity. However, the recent imaging techniques have increased the surgeon's ability for crucial diagnosis of the diseased appendix. Besides the above-mentioned criteria, with its clinical features diagnosis and management, the author was deeply searched in many scientific databases including EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Pubmed Central (PMC), Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus."

Pregnants with a diagnosis of TP, selected for acute abdomen or not, were evaluated and compared, concerning EP local-ization (right/left), age, parity, symptoms (menstrual delay, vaginal bleeding, and groin pain), initial β-hCG value, endometrial thickness, presence of rupture, and treatment type (methotrexate and surgery). On a total of 122 pregnants with TP, 32 showed acute abdomen, 45 had a TP located in the right tube and 32 in the left tube. In the acute abdomen group, parity, initial β-hCG level, and endometrial thickness were greater than non-acute abdomen group. In addition to this, the frequency of bleeding complaints, right-sided TP, rupture, and need for surgery were higher, than to the non-acute abdomen group. The frequency of the previous EP and methotrexate treatment was higher in those with the left-sided TP compared to those with the right-sided TP. EP rate, in patients with TP who applied to the emergency department with acute abdominal symptoms, was mostly located in the right tube with greater frequency of salpingectomy in open surgery."

There are various etiologies causing acute abdomen, most common being acute appendicitis; however, there are rare causes of acute abdomen as well and one should keep them in mind while handling a patient with unusual clinical features. We herein present a 26-year-old male, with no past medical or surgical history, presenting with acute abdominal pain and distension to the ED. He was found to have a large vascular retroperitoneal mass on computed tomography which had invaded and perforated the duodenum thus causing the acute presentation. Repair of the duodenal perforation and sampling of the mass were performed in terms of surgical management. Pathology results revealed the mass originating from a burned out testis yolk sac tumor with embryonal carcinoma component. Although the original tumor had regressed at the testis, its metastasis at the retroperitoneal area had caused the clinical condition. This entity is described as the retroperitoneal metastasis of a burned-out testicular tumor. Few cases presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to invasion of the retroperitoneal metastasis have been reported. However, this is the first case in the literature presenting with duodenal perforation and acute abdomen. Sampling of the retroperitoneal tumor for histopathological diagnosis during the immediate surgical intervention facilitates the diagnostic management in these cases. Although scrotal examination combined with testis tumor marker assessments is essential for optimal patient management, the possibility of a burned-out testicular tumor with normal scrotal examination should always be kept in mind."

The retrospective study was conducted at the General Surgery Department of Mayo Hospital, King Edward Medical University, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised data between January 2014 and May 2019 related to cases regardless of age and gender that required emergency vascular surgery after diagnosis by a consultant surgeon at the surgical emergency. The cases were analysed from admission till discharge. Data was analysed using SPSS 20. Of the 135 cases, 127(94%) were males. The overall mean age was 28.8±11.5 years (range: 14-63 years). Mean duration of hospital stay was 11±3.92 days (range: 4-22 days). Three major peripheral arteries injured were brachial 32(38.5%), popliteal 55(40.7%) and femoral 20(20.7%), with more than half with complete transection 75(55.6%).

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdomen. During the pandemic, to contain the spread of COVID-19, there were some integral changes in the medical processes based on the pandemic prevention policy, especially regarding emergency surgery. This study was conducted to investigate whether this pandemic also impacted the decision-making for both patients and medical personnel along with the treatment outcomes. Patients of age 18 years or older who were diagnosed clinically and radiologically with acute appendicitis between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 202,0 were reviewed. The data of 1991 cases were collected and used for this study. Two groups were formed, one group before and the other group after the outbreak. The gathered data included gender, age, appendiceal fecalith, outcomes of treatment, and long-term outcomes of non-operation (8 months follow-up). We also collected details of surgical cases from the above two groups. This data also included age, gender, appendiceal fecalith, fever, jaundice, length of onset before presenting to an emergency department (ED), anesthesia, surgery, white cell count, pathology, complications, and length of stay. We compared the above data respectively and analyzed the differences. Compared to the period before the outbreak, patient visits for acute appendicitis remarkably dropped (19.8%), but surgical cases showed no change (dropped by roughly 5%). There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in failure of non-operation(after the pandemic 8.31% vs. before pandemic 3.22%), interval appendectomy(after pandemic 6.29% vs. before pandemic 12.84%), recurrence(after pandemic 23.27% vs. before pandemic 14.46%), and outcomes of recurrence. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in anesthesia method, surgery way, and complications( before pandemic 4.15% vs. after pandemic9.89% P < 0.05) in patients who underwent the surgery. There was no statistical difference (P > 0.05) concerning age, gender, fever, jaundice, appendiceal fecalith, white cell count, and length of onset before presenting to the ED. The current pandemic prevention policy is very effective, but some decision-making processes of doctor-patient have changed in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, that further influenced some treatment outcomes and might lead to a potential economic burden. It is essential to address the undue concern of everyone and optimize the treatment process."

It is quite challenging for the clinician to make a precise differential diagnosis because it has various etiologies, overlapping clinical presentations and the extreme tenderness over the area that makes clinical examination difficult. Torsion of the testis is a surgical emergency condition with prevalence of acute scrotal disease in the paediatric population that occurs due to twisting the spermatic cord.

It is a serious condition with a mortality rate of up to 20%, and it is the third most common cause of surgical abdomen after appendicitis and intestinal obstruction. The aim of this study to discuss clinical profile and management of perforation peritonitis in a hospital in central Nepal. This prospective study was done for one year at Bharatpur Hospital, Chitwan Nepal. In our study, only patient above 15 years were included and those who were not fit for anesthesia and surgery were excluded. Most of the patient were diagnosed clinically supported by lab investigations and imaging like X-ray and ultrasonography of abdomen. The variables analyzed were the risk factors of the patient like smoking, alcohol, liver disease and previous abdominal surgeries. The majority of the patients were in the age group 50-59 years in male and 40-49 years in female. Among sixty cases, 31 were female and 29 were male with Female: Male ratio of 1.06:1. The most common cause of perforation found was peptic ulcer compromising 88.3% (53 cases) followed by appendicular perforation accounting 8.3% (5 cases). Similarly, Tubercular perforation was found in 3.3%. Smoking was most common risk factor accounting 88.3%, followed by alcohol consumption (48.33%) while, 15% of patients had positive history of NSAIDs consumption. On imaging, 38.33% patient had air fluid level on X-ray and 78.33% had gas under diaphragm. On blood investigation, leukocytosis was found in 53.33% of patients, hyponatremia in 10% of patients and hypokalemia in 18.33% of patients. While on urine examination, albumin was found in 5% of patients. The repair of perforation along with omentopexy was done in 73.3% of patients while only repair was done in 15% of patients. Only 8.3% opted for appendectomy while a very few patients (3.3%) went for resection with anastomosis. The Postoperative complications found were wound infection (43.3%), paralytic ileus (18.33%), sepsis (15%), followed by electrolyte imbalance (11.6%), postoperative bowel obstruction (6.6%) and burst abdomen (1.6%). While, there were only 3 cases of mortality. Perforation peritonitis is a frequently encountered surgical emergency. Various factors like age, sex, duration, site of perforation, extent of peritonitis and delay in surgical intervention are associated with morbidity and mortality. A successful management depends upon early surgical intervention, source control and exclusive intraoperative peritoneal lavage."

This condition usually occurs following a traumatic incident. Here we present a report of nontraumatic acute compartment syndrome caused by systemic anticoagulation in patients presenting with the acute coronary syndrome. We report a case of a 51-year-old male with acute coronary syndrome receiving systemic anticoagulation, which later developed significant swelling and tensing on his right arm. He also complained of pallor and paresthesia with decreased peripheral oxygen saturation on his right arm. The patient was diagnosed with atraumatic acute compartment syndrome and underwent fasciotomy promptly. His symptoms improved after undergoing fasciotomy. Atraumatic acute compartment syndrome is a rare case. Identifying this condition without a typical history of underlying predisposition is important to avoid delaying emergent surgery as the key therapy."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum is anatomically considered as a true diverticulum, with its embryological origins arising from a persistent omphalomesenteric duct. In adults, the disease is usually asymptomatic, often being accidentally diagnosed during imaging tests or surgery to treat other diseases, or due to further complications. We report the case of a 26-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room complaining of pain and abdominal distension for 3 days, progressing to cessation of the elimination of gas for 1 day together with nausea and vomiting. Since the cause of the obstruction was not clearly identified, the patient's clinical status did not improve with non-operative measures and laparoscopy was not available, an exploratory laparotomy was conducted. In the cavity inventory, an approximately 20 cm wide MD was found in the terminal ileum adhered to the distal portion of the anterior abdominal wall. MD is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, with an estimated prevalence of between 0.3 % and 2.9 % in the general population. The clinical picture is usually asymptomatic, with the diagnosis made either via imaging tests performed to investigate other diseases, or during surgery to treat complications. MD is the most common anomaly of the digestive tract, despite its low prevalence. It presents even rarer complications, including obstruction, digestive bleeding, or diverticulitis. It is important to consider the diverticulum as a diagnostic hypothesis in cases of obstruction without apparent causes, but it does not alter the initial management of the patient."

Abdominal ultrasound (USG) was showing left ovarian and fallopian tube indirect inguinal hernia with preserved internal follicles and intact vasculature. The diagnosis of obstructed ovarian and fallopian tube indirect inguinal hernia was made and diagnostic laparoscopy and left sided hernioplasty was performed. Ovary was retrieved back into abdominal cavity and stitched to lateral pelvic wall. Inguinal hernia itself is a rare happening in females and the presence of ovary and fallopian tube along with other hernial content can become a topic of discussion due to rarity of this case. It is of paramount significance to diagnose such cases with great expertise in order to avoid long term complications in terms of preserving fertility among females. Early utilization of radiological investigations like USG abdomen and laparoscopic retrieval of adnexal structures are standard approach in management of such cases.

In the present case, an 81-year-old man affected by liver cirrhosis and dementia and suffering from sexual disinhibition was found lying half-naked and unconscious in his courtyard; profuse bleeding in the perineal area and the absence of the external genitalia were observed. The victim was transferred to hospital and underwent surgical emergency treatment, but he died 2 days later. No sharp tools were found on the scene. Moreover, the autopsy did not reveal any defense or tentative wound on the body and no blood stains on the hands of the victim. Several linear scratches were detected close to the edges of the wound; according to the surgical report, these scratches were clean-cut in the lower part and crenated and infiltrated by blood in the cranial part. Although the medical history of the man could be consistent with self-mutilation, it was not possible to rule out the involvement of other people, including the possibility of an attempt by his relatives to cover up what may have been a self-amputation. Furthermore, the victim's dog vomited parts of the man's genitalia while being transported to a dog shelter. Similar cases have rarely been published in the current forensic literature."

Surgical exploration has a considerable risk of intestinal injury, and surgical treatment may greatly reduce the quality of life after surgery and cause AIO after re-operation. The nonsurgical treatment is effective for approximately 70% to 90% of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). However, the high recurrence (30%) and mortality (2%) rates of ASBO are concerning. Moreover, the ideal management method of ASBO remains debatable. Studies have shown that acupuncture can also promote postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery and prevent postoperative complications such as nausea, vomiting, and visceral pain. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of AIO. Randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of acupuncture for adhesive bowel obstruction published until November 2021 were identified by searching 8 comprehensive databases. Data analysis was performed using RevMan v. 5.4 and Stata software v. 16.0. The random-effects model and the fixed-effects model were used to perform the meta-analysis on the experimental group and control group. Twelve studies with a total of 892 participants were included. The results showed that the experimental group had a significantly higher effective rate (relative risk: 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.28; P < .00001) and a markedly shorter time of the first defecation (mean difference: -11.49, 95% CI: -19.31 to -3.66; P = .004) than the control group. The experimental group also showed a reduction in the duration of abdominal pain, and the reduced length of hospital stay. However, no statistical differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of the surgery conversion rate. Acupuncture is effective in the treatment of AIO. It can remarkably alleviate some clinical symptoms in patients with AIO."

    "abstract": "Oesophageal perforation is an uncommon surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. The timing and type of intervention is crucial and there has been a major paradigm shift towards minimal invasive management over the last 15 years. Herein, we review our management of spontaneous and iatrogenic oesophageal perforations and assess the short- and long-term outcomes. We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients presenting with intra-thoracic oesophageal perforation between January 2004 and Dec 2020 in a single tertiary hospital. Seventy-four patients were identified with oesophageal perforations: 58.1% were male; mean age of 68.28 ± 13.67 years. Aetiology was spontaneous in 42 (56.76%), iatrogenic in 29 (39.2%) and foreign body ingestion/related to trauma in 3 (4.1%). The diagnosis was delayed in 29 (39.2%) cases for longer than 24 h. There was change in the primary diagnostic modality over the period of this study with CT being used for diagnosis for 19 of 20 patients (95%). Initial management of the oesophageal perforation included a surgical intervention in 34 [45.9%; primary closure in 28 (37.8%), resection in 6 (8.1%)], endoscopic stenting in 18 (24.3%) and conservative management in 22 (29.7%) patients. On multivariate analysis, there was an effect of pathology (malignant vs. benign; p = 0.003) and surgical treatment as first line (p = 0.048) on 90-day mortality. However, at 1-year and overall follow-up, time to presentation (≤ 24 h vs. > 24 h) remained the only significant variable (p = 0.017 & p = 0.02, respectively). Oesophageal perforation remains a condition with high mortality. The paradigm shift in our tertiary unit suggests the more liberal use of CT to establish an earlier diagnosis and a higher rate of oesophageal stenting as a primary management option for iatrogenic perforations. Time to diagnosis and management continues to be the most critical variable in the overall outcome."

Secondary endpoints will be to evaluate to analyze the prognostic role of existing risk-scores to define the most suitable scoring system for gastro-intestinal surgical emergency. The primary outcomes are 30-day overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. Secondary outcomes are 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, stratified for each procedure or cause of intervention, length of hospital stay, admission and length of stay in ICU, and place of discharge (home or rehabilitation or care facility). In conclusion, to improve the level of care that should be reserved for these patients, we aim to analyze the clinicopathological findings, management strategies and short-term outcomes of gastrointestinal emergency procedures performed in patients over 18, to analyze the prognostic role of existing risk-scores and to define new tools suitable for EGS. This process could ameliorate outcomes and avoid futile treatments. These results may potentially influence the survival of many high-risk EGS procedure."

    "abstract": "The incidence of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) among critically ill COVID-19 patients has been reported ranging from 3.8 to 4 %. A 57-year-old female presented with acute abdomen for last three days and tested positive for COVID-19. Abdominal X-ray showed prominent dilated small bowel loops with multiple air fluid levels, and absence of a completely visible colon. She underwent emergency laparotomy where blackish gangrenous bowel loops were seen and resected. CECT scan in over half of the AMI patients may show patent mesenteric vessels. However, such patency of mesenteric vessels should not rule out the possibility of AMI in cases of COVID-19 with prominent GI signs and symptoms, especially those admitted in ICU. AMI is a life-threatening complication that may occur in COVID-19 patients. It should be suspected in COVID-19 patients complaining of severe abdominal pain in addition to pulmonary symptoms."

Trauma (accidental or iatrogenic such as a percutaneous biopsy or cholecystectomy surgery), cholelithiasis, biliary tract parasitosis, vasculitis, vascular malformations, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases and coagulopathies have been described as causes of hemorrhage within the lumen of the gallbladder. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulants may represent a risk factor. We report the case of a 76-year-old male patient. An urgent contrast computed tomography scan demonstrated relevant distension of the gallbladder filled with hyperdense non-homogeneous content. The gallbladder walls were of regular thickness. Near the anterior wall a focus of suspected active bleeding was observed. Due to the progressive decrease in hemoglobin despite three blood transfusions, this was an indication for urgent surgery. Early diagnosis of this potentially fatal pathology is essential in order to plan a strategy and eventually proceed with urgent surgical treatment."

One of the most common surgeries manifested is an appendectomy, but with recent advances, non-operative management has evolved using antibiotics. In adult patients with simple appendicitis, we identified the role of surgical and non-surgical therapy. One of the most common surgeries manifested is an appendectomy, but with recent advances, non-operative management has evolved using antibiotics. In adults suffering from mild appendicitis, we identified the role of surgical and non-surgical therapy. The analysis indicated that the Antibiotics versus Primary Appendectomy in Children (APAC) did not establish non-inferiority of antibiotics vs. appendectomy with a pre-specified small margin. In contrast to the majority of appendectomies that are carried out laparoscopically, the surgeries were almost usually open. Appendectomies, both laparoscopic and open, are not the same procedure. Antibiotic therapy is effective in about 60% of cases of simple appendicitis. A surgery-only strategy would reduce antibiotic exposure, a factor to consider in these days of antimicrobial stewardship. Therefore, studies are being conducted on whether to shift alone on antibiotics or with appendectomy to have better results with fewer complications. Future studies should focus on appendicitis features and long-term unfavorable consequences, including antibiotic resistance or Clostridium difficile colitis, most responsive to antibiotics by utilizing laparoscopic procedures as controls. Using it along with appendectomy may change the outcome showing a better prognosis."

Our study aims to leverage a nationally representative database to assess contemporary in-hospital outcomes in surgical repair of ATAAD, as well as the association of age and sex with outcomes. The National Inpatient Sample was queried to identify hospital discharge records of patients aged ≥18 years who underwent urgent surgical repair of ATAAD between 2017 and 2018. Patients with a diagnosis of thoracic aortic dissection, who underwent surgical intervention of the ascending aorta, were identified. Patient demographics were assessed, and predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified. We identified 7805 weighted cases of surgically repaired ATAAD nationally, with an overall mortality of 15.3%. Mean age was 60.0 ± 13.6 years. There was a male predominance, although female subjects made up a larger proportion of older age groups-female subjects up 18.4% of patients younger than 40 years with ATAAD but 53.6% of patients older than 80 years. In multivariable analysis controlling for sex, race, comorbidities, and malperfusion, age was a significant predictor of mortality. Patients aged 71 to 80 years had a 5.3-fold increased risk of mortality compared with patients ≤40 years old (P < .001), and patients aged >80 years had a 6.8-fold increased risk of mortality (P < .001). Sex was not significantly associated with mortality. Surgical repair of ATAAD continues to carry high risk of morbidity and mortality, with outcomes impacted significantly by patient age, regardless of patient comorbidity burden."

Training primary care physicians in Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) has become part of the processes that improve the quality of patient care and serve to guide the diagnostic impression quickly and effectively. With the purpose of highlighting the applications and challenges of POCUS use in US primary health care, we conducted a narrative review based on PubMed-indexed and Cochrane Library English text publications searched in May-July 2022 using a combination of key terms including point of care ultrasound, primary care, and US healthcare. Many studies have shown that POCUS has a positive impact on fostering medical attention and reducing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Besides assisting in procedures, POCUS has a head-to-toe application in evaluating inflammatory and infectious conditions, acute abdomen, cardiopulmonary function, musculoskeletal and vascular pathologies. However, its uniform implementation is limited across the US healthcare system due to multitudes of barriers such as lack of training, resource scarcity, and low reimbursement. Training primary care physicians in general and emergency care providers, in particular, is key to scaleup POCUS use. Large size studies are paramount to further explore the effectiveness of POCUS and identify key challenges to its implementation."

Due to the large variety of surgical bariatric techniques, emergency surgeons have to be aware of the main functional outcomes and long-term surgical complications following the most performed bariatric surgical procedures. The purpose of these evidence-based guidelines is to present a consensus position from members of the WSES in collaboration with IFSO bariatric experienced surgeons, on the management of acute abdomen after bariatric surgery focusing on long-term complications in patients who have undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. A working group of experienced general, acute care, and bariatric surgeons was created to carry out a systematic review of the literature following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and to answer the PICO questions formulated after the Operative management in bariatric acute abdomen survey. The literature search was limited to late/long-term complications following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The acute abdomen after bariatric surgery is a common cause of admission in emergency departments. Knowledge of the most common late/long-term complications (&gt; 4 weeks after surgical procedure) following sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and their anatomy leads to a focused management in the emergency setting with good outcomes and decreased morbidity and mortality rates. A close collaboration between emergency surgeons, radiologists, endoscopists, and anesthesiologists is mandatory in the management of this group of patients in the emergency setting."

It is most often found in traffic accidents and is usually associated with pelvic fractures. While an extraperitoneal bladder injury is mostly treated conservatively, an intraperitoneal one is mostly treated surgically. We present a 54-year-old obese man injured in a traffic accident, with an intraperitoneal rupture of the bladder after blunt abdominal trauma with no signs of pelvic fracture and without signs of traumatic injury to the abdominal organs. The vignette case constitutes a bladder injury that was treated surgically and sutured in two layers with absorbable thread, with the placement of a urinary catheter. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged from the ward on the seventh postoperative day. Of note, the clinical presentation of a bladder rupture can be manifested as a nonspecific lower abdominal pain or with symptoms of an acute abdomen and that is why imaging plays a major role in the diagnosis and further treatment procedures. Surgical treatment of such injuries can be performed laparoscopically or as open surgery. To this end, rapid diagnosis of bladder rupture is necessary because it can lead to complications that endanger patients if overlooked."

It is an uncommon cause of acute abdomen; it represents a real emergency condition and must be considered in any patient with atypical abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. This is a detailed case presentation and non-operative management of idiopathic spontaneous hemoperitoneum with atypical abdominal pain. This is 45-year-old male was admitted with a history of progressive abdominal pain for one year. He denied any history of recent trauma, physical assault, bleeding disorder, or drug abuse. The plain abdominal film was unremarkable, and a computed tomographic scan with intravenous contrast (CT) revealed an intra-peritoneal hemorrhage, while esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and CT angiography (CTA) revealed no abnormality. The patient was managed non-operatively with a good outcome. Six days later, the patient was discharged with further follow-up in outpatient. The follow-up computed tomographic scan with intravenous contrast revealed complete resolution of the hemoperitoneum, and the patient remained asymptomatic. Spontaneous hemoperitoneum is usually the result of an unknown cause in the non-traumatic abdomen. Also, in between 30 and 38 % of documented cases, the source of bleeding could not be determined. The pathogenesis remains unclear. The \"double-rupture\" phenomenon can explain the clinical deterioration after the initial presentation of the hemodynamically stable.

Quick diagnosis, management and intervention improves survival rate and decreases maternal and foetal morbidity. Patient, 36 years old, mother of three children delivered by cesarean section, admitted for acute abdominal pain in the context of a poorly monitored pregnancy estimated at 25 weeks of amenorrhea. Pelvic ultrasound showed a large peritoneal effusion with the presence of an evolving intrauterine pregnancy with cardiac activity present, the placenta was with anterior coverage. An emergency laparotomy revealed uterine rupture with active hemorrhage localized on the anterior uterine scar with placental protrusion was noted. A cesarean section was quickly performed to save the fetus. The placenta was left in place and a difficult hysterectomy was then undertaken. Uterine rupture in second trimester caused by placental percreta is a rare event that can be life threatening for both mother and fetus. Placenta percreta should be considered when diagnosing internal bleeding in a patient during the first trimester of pregnancy. Placenta percreta is a rare but severe obstetric complication that is potentially life threatening for both the mother and fetus.

The objective of this study is (1) to provide epidemiological information on hand injuries and their patterns and (2) to visualise the frequencies of affected areas of the hand in relation to the most common trauma mechanisms using color-coded heatmaps. This prospective single-center observational trial conducted at a surgical emergency department in Germany collected data of hand trauma patients using a standardized documentation form. Demographic data, trauma-related data, diagnostic and therapeutic measures were analyzed. Color-coded heatmaps were generated marking anatomic danger zones. 435 patients with a mean age of 39.5 were included. Most patients admitted on their own initiative (79%). Leisure and sport injuries were most frequent (75%). Digiti II-V were injured most commonly (43%), followed by metacarpals (19%) and the thumb (14%). Blunt trauma and cuts accounted for most injuries (74%). Hand-graphics depicted color-coded frequencies of the affected areas of the palmar and dorsal aspect of the hand for the most common types of injury, as well as the most frequent circumstances of accident. Elective surgery was recommended in 25% of cases, and hand surgical follow-up was proposed in over 50% of cases. The dorsal aspect of the hand including the 5th metacarpal, the radial wrist and thenar region, as well as the fingertips of Digiti II/III represent anatomic danger zones to injury of the hand. Due to the large variety of potentially injured structures, diagnosis and treatment is not trivial.

Its prevalence remains unknown, but it has been estimated to affect up to 10% of women of reproductive age. Although it is a benign oestrogen-dependent gynaecological condition, women may describe painful symptoms such as cyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea and dyschezia. Intestinal endometriosis may affect the ileum, appendix, sigmoid colon and rectum. It may present with a myriad of symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and haematochezia. Caecal endometriosis can present as an acute appendicitis, making the diagnosis challenging to establish in pregnancy. Transmural involvement and acute occlusion are very rare events. The gold standard for diagnosis remains laparoscopy with tissue sampling for histological confirmation. Although endometriosis improves during pregnancy under the effect of progesterone, the ectopic endometrium becomes decidualised with a progressive reduction in size. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her mid-30s with acute onset of right-sided abdominal pain at 35 weeks gestation. Physical examination was suggestive of an acute appendicitis and MRI showed an inflamed caecum. She became acutely unwell requiring an emergency caesarean section. A mass in the caecum was observed with impending perforation at the caecal pole. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis with decidualisation. Although endometriosis improves during pregnancy, this case shows the unexpected complications of the disease and demonstrates the importance of considering endometriosis in the differential diagnosis of an acute abdomen in women of childbearing age to prevent maternal morbidity and fetal loss."

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes symptoms that may mimic a viral pneumonia, with potential for serious sequelae, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulopathy, multiorgan dysfunction, systemic vascular abnormalities, and secondary infection. The authors describe a case of a 15-year-old boy who presented with a right subdural empyema and sinusitis while having active COVID-19 infection. The patient initially presented with left-sided weakness, frontal sinusitis, and subdural empyema. Emergent surgery was performed for evacuation of empyema and sinus debridement. Samples of purulent material within the subdural space were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The patient had a successful recovery and regained the use of his right side after combined treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a bacterial subdural empyema associated with frontal sinusitis in a coinfected patient with COVID-19 without evidence of COVID-19 intracranial infection. A subdural empyema, which is a surgical emergency, was likely a superinfection caused by COVID-19. This, along with the coagulopathy caused by the virus, introduced unique challenges to the treatment of a known pathology."

Data were collected for all scrotal explorations undertaken at our non-urological centre during this time. Sixteen scrotal explorations were performed from April to June 2019, one had testicular torsion (6.25%).

She had a medical history of coronary artery disease and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin for 3 years. Computed tomography disclosed disproportional dilatation of the segmental small bowel and near-total obstruction of the intestinal lumen at the level of the jejunum, indicating an acute abdomen. We performed laparoscopic exploration and found a segmental distal jejunum was tense, heavy, firm, and discolored with a blue hue. Histopathological examination of the resected jejunum revealed diffuse hemorrhage and necrosis at the mucosa and submucosal layers, indicating SISBH. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged in a relatively stable condition.

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most frequent surgical emergency in the paediatric population. Complicated appendicitis accounts for 30% of cases and is inextricably linked to postoperative infectious complications. A study at our institution showed that amoxicillin-clavulanate resistant Escherichia coli in complicated appendicitis was significantly linked to postoperative infectious complications. These findings led to a change in the empirical antibiotic protocol (amoxicillin-clavulanate changed to ceftriaxone + metronidazole as of 2017), intending to reduce postoperative infectious complications in complicated appendicitis in our institution. This study aimed to analyse the microbiology and resistance profiles of pathogens of complicated appendicitis at our institution since implementing the new antibiotic protocol and the postoperative infectious complications rate. We designed a retrospective comparative cohort study. During the defined study period (01 January 2017 to 31 July 2020), medical records were analysed for cases of acute appendicitis, complicated appendicitis and postoperative infectious complications, retaining only those who fulfilled inclusion criteria. Postoperative outcomes, microbiology and antibiotic resistance of peritoneal swabs were analysed. During the study period, 95 patients presented with a complicated appendicitis, and 11 (12%) developed postoperative infectious complications. The most frequent pathogens found in complicated appendicitis were E. coli (66%), Streptococcus anginosus (45%), and Bacteroides fragilis (22%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in 17% of complicated appendicitis. Pathogens involved in postoperative infectious complications mirrored the distribution found in complicated appendicitis without postoperative infectious complications. Antibiotic susceptibility analysis showed that 10 (15%) of E. coli strains were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate but sensitive to ceftriaxone + metronidazole, with only one strain responsible for causing a postoperative infectious complication. Six additional strains of E. coli (9%) were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and our empirical antibiotic regimen but were not associated with an increase in postoperative infectious complications. Compared with our previous study, there was a decrease in postoperative infectious complications from 16% to 12%. Postoperative infectious complications caused by amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant E. coli decreased from 28% to 9%. This retrospective study demonstrated a decrease in the rate of postoperative infectious complications due to amoxicillin-clavulanate-resistant E. coli in complicated appendicitis. These findings accentuate the need to implement evidence-based treatment protocols based on local microbiology profiles and resistance rates to optimise post-operative antibiotics in complicated appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the first etiology for abdominal surgical emergency. Ascariasis is the most common helminth infection in tropical countries where it is endemic. The ability of intestinal helminths to wander through the digestive system means that it can end up in the appendix lumen and lead to appendicitis by luminal obstruction. However, this presentation is still rarely described in the literature. In fact, most of the diagnoses of roundworm associated with appendicitis are made retrospectively by the discovery of its eggs on the pathological examination of an appendectomy specimen. We report the case of a 7-year-old patient living in a tropical area who consulted for acute right lower quadrant pain. The ultrasound suspected the diagnosis of appendicitis and also revealed multiple intestinal worms including one in contact with the inflamed appendix. Surgical exploration confirmed appendicitis associated with roundworm partly in the appendicular lumen through a perforation."

    "abstract": "The timing of treatment for Gartland type III supracondylar fractures has been an area of contention as it was previously thought to be a surgical emergency. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to clarify whether there is a difference in perioperative outcomes between early and delayed treatment for Gartland type III supracondylar humeral fractures in children. Literature search and study selection were performed according to the PRISMA process. The early surgery (ES) and delayed surgery (DS) groups were defined by the authors of each study included, based on the time to surgery. The primary outcome was the risk of conversion to open reduction. The secondary outcome was perioperative complication risks. A total of 14 studies met the eligibility criteria (n = 1263 patients), of which 665 (52.7%) patients had undergone early surgery, while 598 (47.3%) had delayed surgery. On meta-analysis, there was no significant difference between ES and DS for the outcome of open reduction conversion risk. There was also no significant difference for the secondary outcomes of post-operative compartment syndrome, iatrogenic nerve injury, vascular injury, and surgical site infection. Despite the limitations in the literature, evidence exists to support the notion that a delayed approach to the surgical treatment of Gartland type III supracondylar humeral fractures in children does not result in an increased risk of converting to open reduction and perioperative complications."

Retrospective observational study of patients who underwent surgery for PPU at the 1st Department of Surgery - Thoracic, Abdominal and Injury Surgery, General University Hospital in the period 2015-2020. Analysis of the microbiological analytical results of peritoneal fluid. The microbiological profile of PPU-associated peritonitis is somewhat different from microbial pathogens involved in secondary peritonitis due to bowel perforation. A high rate of negative culture findings, high incidence of Candida spp. and low incidence of anaerobic bacteria are characteristic for PPU-associated peritonitis. Negative culture from the peritoneal fluid collected during surgery was identified in 42% of the patients. A total of 66 isolates of microbial pathogens were identified, including Candida spp. (42.5%), aerobic gram-positive bacteria (30.3%), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (22.7%) and anaerobic bacteria (4.5%). Candida albicans and Candida glabrata represented the most common species. Decreased susceptibility to fluconazole and resistance to itraconazole was associated with all Candida glabrata isolates. Although PPU-associated peritonitis is mostly of community origin, we confirmed a significant incidence of Candida spp. with decreased azole susceptibility. The choice of antifungal therapy should always be based on local epidemiology."

    "abstract": "Metastatic melanoma of the small intestine is relatively common, and among affected patients, the proportion with involvement of the small intestine ranges from 35% to 70%. Small intestinal perforation as a primary manifestation of metastatic melanoma is rare. We present the exceptional case of a perforation at the jejunojejunostomy after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass caused by metastatic melanoma. A 59-year-old woman with a history of a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and toe amputation due to malignant melanoma (stadium IIIC) presented with an acute abdomen. The abdominal computed tomography scan showed a covered perforation at the jejunojejunostomy of the gastric bypass. The patient underwent an urgent surgical exploration revealing massive tumoral invasion of the anastomosis. The tumoral mass and anastomosis were resected and a new jejunojejunostomy was created. Histopathological examination identified the tumor as a malignant melanoma, so the current abdominal lesions were presumed to be metastases. The postoperative course was uneventful and adjuvant immunotherapy was started a week later. One year after surgery she was doing well with maintenance immunotherapy and there was no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease. We report the first case of a perforation at the jejunojejunostomy after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass caused by metastatic melanoma. This exceptional case illustrates that a history of malignant melanoma in case of an acute abdomen should raise suspicion of possible metastatic disease."

The aim of this study was to evaluate 10 years of experience with testicular torsion, point out our pitfalls in diagnosis and management, determine our likelihood of performing orchiectomy for potentially reversible injury. Records of patients operated for testicular torsion in the last decade were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical findings, symptoms, type of surgery, accuracy of radiological evaluation, and the outcome were analyzed. Orchiectomy specimens were reevaluated and histologically graded to determine the existence of previously undetermined low-grade injury. In total, 107 children were operated for testicular torsion. Presentation included pain 96 (89.7%), scrotal swelling 48 (44.8%). Doppler ultrasonography was performed in 96 patients with false-negative results in 26 (27%). Testicular salvage occurred in 65 (60.7%) patients of which 6 (9.2%) developed subsequent testicular atrophy. Forty-two (33.9%) patients were treated with orchiectomy and histologic reevaluation, and grading of the specimens revealed 4 (9.7%) low-grade injury which indicates a potential of reversible injury. Seventeen (13.7%) patients had normal testicular anatomy in surgery. Surgical exploration is mandated in case of clinical suspicion for testicular torsion even with a normal flow Doppler ultrasound. Macroscopic evaluation does not always correlate with microscopic findings, and a decision according to it may result in excision of potentially viable testis. Further studies are required to determine the actual risk of contralateral autoimmune damage and increase the rate testicular salvageability after testicular torsion."

    "abstract": "Perforated colonic diverticulitis with purulent or fecal contamination (PCD) is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, open surgery as a Hartmann procedure (HP) has been performed. Feasibility of the laparoscopic approach (LA) either with primary anastomosis (PA) or as an HP has been shown, but evidence and implementation into daily routine remain low. We analysed all patients with PCD and emergency surgery at our institution to compare post-operative outcomes between LA and open surgery. Our results should add more evidence about the potential benefit of LA in treating PCD. This retrospective analysis conducted at a tertiary care centre in Germany included all patients with PCD undergoing emergency surgery between June 2007 and February 2019. Mortality and postoperative morbidity according to Clavien-Dindo-Classification are the primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were stoma-free survival and length of hospital stay. Seventy-seven patients were identified (41 female/36 male; median age 67.9 years). Sixty patients underwent a LA (conversion in 9 of 60, 15%). PA has been performed in 25 of 77 patients (22 LA, 3 with open surgery). Severe complications and death (Clavien-Dindo-Classification grade IIIb-V) were lower in patients with LA (17/60, 28%) compared to open surgery (9/17, 53%; p = 0.082) as well as the length of hospital stay (LOS; LA 9 days vs. open surgery 17 days; p = 0.016). The LA is feasible in the majority of patients with PCD and may be warranted as a routine in emergency surgery. Although limited by a selection bias of this retrospective study, the LA seems to reduce morbidity and LOS."

    "abstract": "Background Primary small bowel volvulus is a common surgical emergency in some parts of the globe. Its seasonal nature has not been widely researched. The main objective of this study was to assess its underlying patterns among different gender and geographical location. Materials and methods A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2020 to February 2021 at two comprehensive specialized hospitals in North West Ethiopia. The monthly count of primary small bowel volvulus was analyzed for patterns using Minitab 18. Graphical techniques such as run sequence plots, multiple box plots, and correlogram were used. Additive decomposition was also done. The degree of seasonal variation was measured in terms of seasonal indices generated for each month. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test at p < 0.05 was applied to determine statistical significance. Results A total of 235 patients were found to have surgically confirmed diagnosis of primary small bowel volvulus over six years. Most were males (77.4%) and from rural residence (73.2%). The mean age in years was 40.5 (±16.7). Overall, 179 (76.2%) of the total cases, 148 (81.3%) of males, and 138 (80.2%) of rural cases were admitted during June through November. Conclusion Seasonal variation was found to be a feature of primary small bowel volvulus. Knowing its seasonal nature helps raise the threshold of suspicion among health care providers to pass timely clinical decisions particularly in resource-limited setups."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum is the commonest congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract in humans that is commonly encountered during surgical practice as the cause of the patient's presentation or as an incidental finding during other unrelated procedures. Most clinical symptoms are caused due to its complications. The mean age of the involved patients was 24.79 years with slight male predominance, 62.9% males compared to 37.1% females. The mean length of the diverticulum was 55.21 cm. The most common emergency presentation was right lower quadrant abdominal pain in 31% of the patients, intestinal obstruction in 28.6%, acute lower abdominal pain and guarding and acute abdomen in 18.6% and 15.7% of patients, respectively, bleeding per rectum in 2.9%, acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain in 1.4%, and obstructed paraumbilical hernia containing the diverticulum in one patient. Perforation of the Meckel's diverticulum was reported in 18.6%. Histopathological examination showed acute inflammation in the wall of the diverticulum in 37.1%, lymphoid hyperplasia in 24.3%, hemorrhagic necrosis in 22.9%, and chronic inflammation in 8.6%. Ectopic mucosa was detected in 50% of the cases, gastric mucosa was detected in 42.86%, ectopic pancreatic mucosa was detected in 5.71%, and both gastric and pancreatic types in 1.43%. Long diverticula are more liable to develop complications. At surgery, inspection and palpation of the wall of the diverticulum must be done for any evidence of inflammation, necrosis, perforation, or abnormal thickening of the walls of the diverticulum. Resection of the segment of the bowel that contains the diverticulum with primary anastomosis is preferable to other procedures due to the risk of leaving behind an abnormal heterotopic mucosa."

    "abstract": "Acute testicular torsion is a surgical emergency due to acute testicular ischemia. Manual testicular detorsion is a testis-saving, bedside therapeutic when performed correctly and in a timely fashion. This procedure is most commonly performed blindly with pain relief as the endpoint for detorsion. However, up to one-third of patients continued to show signs of residual torsion in the operating room even using pain relief as the stopping point for the procedure. We present a case demonstrating the utility of color Doppler ultrasound to confirm complete manual detorsion in a 14-year-old male with acute testicular torsion. The patient underwent 360-degree detorsion and had relief of pain; however, color Doppler demonstrated incomplete return of flow to the testis. After an additional 180-degree turn was made, color Doppler demonstrated complete return of normal vascular flow to the torsed testis. When it comes to testicular viability, timely restoration of blood flow to the testicle is of utmost importance. Manual detorsion is a non-invasive intervention that can be quickly and effectively performed at the bedside. Moreover, using color Doppler ultrasound guidance can ensure that physicians detorse in the proper direction and to completion, by providing instant visualization of restorative flow and ensuring reperfusion of the testis while awaiting definitive surgical management."

We report the first transverse colon volvulus (TCV) case in an adult with pre-diagnosed Williams Syndrome. We report a case of a 22-year-old South Asian adult who presented with complaints of generalized progressive abdominal pain, distension, bilious vomiting, and constipation. Detailed history, physical examination, and radiological investigations confirmed the diagnosis of transverse colon volvulus. A subtotal colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis was done. Patients with Williams Syndrome can develop rare gastrointestinal complications like transverse colon volvulus due to congenital/physiological predisposing factors. It is a surgical emergency and should be diagnosed and managed optimally. In addition, physicians should keep TCV in differential diagnoses while dealing with patients of Williams Syndrome presenting with acute or subacute abdominal pain."

Her medical history showed respiratory distress at birth treated as a neonatal infection. We suspected bilateral choanal atresia due to the absence of fogging on mirror test and failure to pass a 6Fr or 8Fr suction catheter through the nasal cavity into the nasopharynx. Facial CT confirmed the presence of bilateral mixed osteo-membranous choanal atresia. Transpalatal choanoplasty was successfully performed with pre and postoperative endoscopic examination.

Though rare, emergent surgical intervention is often required and management can be various based upon the site of the perforation. This literature has been written in line with the SCARE criteria (Agha et al., 2020) [1]. A 76-year-old man presented with acute abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) revealed and an emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed carefully, which revealed a 7 cm all-layer esophageal laceration in the left lower esophageal wall. In our case, a hiatal hernia was protruding into the mediastinum, and the perforation site was inside of it, but there was no invasion into the thoracic cavity, thus a transabdominal approach was performed without thoracotomy. This type of esophageal perforation within a hiatal hernia is quite rare and provides a unique clinical challenge. In addition, A review reported the average length of spontaneous esophageal perforation to be around 2 cm while our case had a perforation with a length of 7 cm. We chose the combination of the simple suture with omental buttress and wide drainage, but a complete fundoplication was impossible due to its large size of perforation. We chose the open abdominal approach because the case had high inflammation, a hiatal hernia and possibility of retro-gastric perforation. However, MIS should have been considered first if a situation or human resources allow it."

Laparoscopic surgery is considered a safe and effective method for treating incarcerated femoral hernias, which have different surgical approaches to releasing the contents of the hernia. We report the case of a 65-year-old female with a right incarcerated femoral hernia with an irreducible mass in the right femoral region for 2 days diagnosed by physical examination and abdominal ultrasonography. We used a catheter to inject normal saline into the hernia sac during surgery. Injury and rupture of the small intestine were avoided, and the polypropylene mesh was successfully repaired. Incarcerated femoral hernias is a common surgical emergency that can lead to intestinal obstruction, strangulation, or infarction. Laparoscopy is advantageous for treating incarcerated femoral hernias. In our case, spatial replacement theory was used to release the incarcerated small intestine. The principle is that changing the internal and external pressures of the hernial sac returns the hernia contents. The non-necrotic small intestine did not lead to intraperitoneal infection, and the standard transabdominal preperitoneal repair was simultaneously performed with a polypropylene mesh. Laparoscopic incarcerated femoral hernia repair is a common emergency surgery that is safe and feasible for treating incarcerated femoral hernia using the spatial replacement method, the most beneficial to patients."

As the mainstay treatment, fasciotomies involve substantial skin incisions and are thus prone to complications such as skin necrosis, wound infection, and permanent disability. Multidisciplinary care instituted at the time of fasciotomy can facilitate timely closure and minimize the complication profile. Several approaches are available to enhance outcomes of fasciotomy wounds, and a comprehensive knowledge of these options affords the treating surgeon greater flexibility and confidence in optimal management. Common techniques include early primary closure, gradual approximation, skin grafting, and negative pressure therapy. There is currently no consensus on the best method of closure. The purpose of this study was to review fasciotomy wound management from the time of initial release to final closure. Highlights include preparation for closing these wounds; the various techniques for fasciotomy closure, including adjunct options; evaluation of timing and staging; and injury-specific features, such as fracture management, limited subcutaneous tissues, and hand fasciotomies.

Therefore, this study aimed to establish a prediction model for irreversible intestinal ischemia in strangulated bowel obstruction. We included 83 patients who underwent emergency surgery for strangulated bowel obstruction between January 2014 and March 2022. The predictors of irreversible intestinal ischemia in strangulated bowel obstruction were identified using logistic regression analysis, and a prediction model for irreversible intestinal ischemia in strangulated bowel obstruction was established using the regression coefficients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and fivefold cross-validation was used to assess the model. The prediction model (range, 0-4) was established using a white blood cell count of ≥ 12,000/µL and the computed tomography value of peritoneal fluid that was ≥ 20 Hounsfield units. The areas of the receiver operating characteristic curve of the new prediction model were 0.814 and 0.807 after fivefold cross-validation. A score of ≥ 2 was strongly suggestive of irreversible intestinal ischemia in strangulated bowel obstruction and necessitated bowel resection (odds ratio = 15.938). The bowel resection rates for the prediction scores of 0, 2, and 4 were 15.2%, 66.7%, and 85.0%, respectively. Our model may help predict irreversible intestinal ischemia that necessitates bowel resection for strangulated bowel obstruction cases and thus enable surgeons to recognize the severity of the situation, prepare for deterioration of patients with progression of intestinal ischemia, and select the appropriate surgical procedure for treatment."

    "title": "Primary Epiploic Appendagitis of the Appendix Vermiformis.",
    "abstract": "Primary epiploic appendagitis, a relatively rare and self-limiting disease, often clinically mimics conditions of the acute abdomen such as acute appendicitis and acute diverticulitis. It is important to make accurate diagnoses because its treatment is conservative. Ultrasonography and computed tomographic studies enable a reliable diagnosis to prevent unnecessary invasive procedures. Herein, we report a case of primary epiploic appendagitis of the appendix vermiformis with clinical, laboratory and CT findings to improve awareness of this condition. A 29-year-old female presented with acute abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. Her medical history was not significant for surgery. She had no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or fever. On physical examination, she had right lower quadrant tenderness with mild defense and rebound upon palpation. The leukocyte count (6300 mm-3) and other laboratory parameters, including urine tests, were unremarkable. With these findings, the provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made, and a CT examination (Mx 8000 IDT 16, Philips, USA) was done upon the request of the referring physicians. The abdominal CT showed normal appendix vermiformis. However, a fat density lesion surrounding a hyperdense rim was seen adjacent to the appendix vermiformis. The diagnosis of PEA was thus established based on the characteristic radiologic findings. The patient was managed conservative treatment with pain medication as an outpatient. After a one-week follow-up, the patient was observed to be symptom-free and concluded to have recovered fully from their physician. To conclude, PEA needs to be considered by emergency clinicians and radiologists in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain. With this in mind, it becomes easier for a substantive diagnosis to be made by ultrasound alone or combined with CT to prevent unnecessary surgical interventions, antibiotherapy and hospitalization."

    "abstract": "We diagnosed various cases of rhino-orbital-cerebral- COVID-associated Mucormycosis (ROCM-CAM) during India's second wave of COVID-19. This helped formulate novel suggestions for improving laboratory output, applicable anywhere in the world. To diagnose ROCM-CAM by microbiological methods, we used direct microscopy and conventional culture on various clinical samples within the shortest turn-around time. Prospective single-center observational study. Patients with ROCM-CAM. Of 113 suspected cases of ROCM-CAM during May 2021, direct microscopy and culture could confirm the disease in 87.61% and 44.25% of patients, respectively. The highest pathogen isolation was seen from maxillary bone fragments, FESS-guided biopsy from pterygopalatine fossae, nasal turbinates and nasal mucosal biopsy. Direct microscopy could diagnose the disease in almost 40% of patients within 24 hours and 60% within two days. Conventional cultures yielded Rhizopus spp. (86%) as the commonest fungal pathogen followed by Mucor spp. (12%) within 7 days. Deep tissue biopsies are more useful for rapid diagnosis than superficial specimens. Routine fungal cultures can supplement case detection and help prognosticate survivors. The management of ROCM is a surgical emergency. The diagnosis of the condition must therefore be prompt and precise. Despite ongoing antifungal therapy, nasal mucosal tissue, FESSguided, and intra-operative tissue biopsies showed the pathogen's highest diagnostic yield. The diagnostic index improved further when multiple (4-5) high-quality specimens were collected. Nasal swabs and crusts, among the most commonly requested specimens worldwide, were found to have an overall low diagnostic potential."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is common surgical emergency that requires early diagnosis and immediate intervention within 6 h since its onset to salvage the testis. However, the decision was made only by the surgeon's experience whether it has to be resected or not. Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) has become an excellent tool to identify biliary and vascular anatomy, and assess perfusion abnormalities in tissues. In this case report, we successfully salvaged the twisted testis, since the testicular blood perfusion was confirmed by means of intraoperative ICG (IICG) fluorescence imaging. A 14-year-old healthy male patient presented due to acute left testicular pain. The patient was diagnosed with TT and had immediate surgery. Macroscopically, the testis had stagnant blood flow and appeared to be dark colored. After manual detorsion, the testis remained cyanotic and with macroscopically poor blood flow. ICG angiography was performed under near-infrared light by laparoscopic camera to assess the perfusion of the affected testicle. An excellent ICG signal appeared after 45 s in the testis, and decision was made to be preserved. Therefore, left orchidopexy was performed to complete the operation. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged the day after surgery. Six months later, the testis did not show any shrinkage, and both sides of the testis showed the same size without any consequences. The blood flow in the testis was visually confirmed during the IICG fluorescence method. ICG fluorescence imaging may become an effective alternative to evaluate whether a testis can be preserved following TT."

This study was conducted with the aim of studying the pattern and outcome of surgically managed acute abdominal cases in a private general hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of acute abdominal cases in adult patients operated at Teklehaimanot General Hospital between January 1, 2018 and August 1, 2019. A total of 267 patients' medical records were reviewed. The male to female ratio was 1.5:1 and majority of patients were between the age range of 20 to 40 years with mean age of 36±16 years. The average duration of symptoms before arrival was 71.1±84.4 hours (range 3 to 504 hours) and only 85 (31.8%) of patients reached to the Hospital within 24 hours or less of onset of symptoms. Acute appendicitis was the most common cause of acute abdomen; observed in 193 (72.3%) of the cases. Overall post-operative complication rate was 14.8% and post-operative mortality rate was 1.9%. It was found that delayed presentation (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.64-7.84), old age (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.89-3.59), and tachycardia at presentation (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.03-6.82) were major predictors of morbidity and mortality in operated patients. In this study acute appendicitis accounted for the majority of cases operated for acute abdomen. Length of post-operative hospital stay, early post-operative complication rate, and overall mortality rate were found to be significantly lower in our series than other reports."

    "abstract": "Due to the mixed population enrolled in different studies i.e., medical and surgical cases, conflicting data exists about the accuracy of quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) scores in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with suspected sepsis presenting to the surgical emergency. A prospective observational study was done in the department of surgery of a tertiary teaching hospital, India from June 2018 to July 2019. Consecutive patients who visited the surgical emergency department with suspected sepsis were included. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death. Of the 410 patients screened, 287 were included in the analysis. The median age was 52 years (interquartile range, 41 to 61years) and 208 (72.8%) were men. Around 56.8% of patients had intra-abdominal pathology, and 43.2% had skin and soft -tissue infection. Sixty-nine (24%) patients died during their hospitalization, 98 (34.1%) patients had organ dysfunction, and 168 (58.5%) patients needed admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). A higher qSOFA score (≥2) was associated with organ dysfunction, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality. The specificity, positive predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of qSOFA for organ dysfunction (85.7%, 67.8%, 76.3%), ICU admission (92.4%, 89.3%, 64.5%), and in-hospital mortality (81.6%, 52.4%, 77.4%) was higher than SIRS. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for qSOFA for these variables was also higher than for SIRS (0.826 vs. 0.524, 0.823 vs. 0.577, and 0.823 vs. 0.555, respectively). qSOFA is a better model for predicting adverse outcomes and mortality, organ dysfunction, and ICU admission in surgical patients. However, SIRS indicates intervention requirements in a surgical patient better than qSOFA."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the benefit of unenhanced CT and single energy iodine mapping (SIM) to conventional contrast-enhanced CT for bowel wall enhancement characterization in an acute abdomen setting. CT images from 45 patients with a suspected acute abdomen who underwent abdominopelvic CT from April 2018 to June 2018 were analyzed retrospectively by two independent radiologists. These patients had been referred by emergency department physicians in a context of acute abdominal pain and had a confirmed etiological diagnosis. Three image sets were evaluated separately (portal phase images alone; portal phase images and unenhanced images, portal phase images, and single energy iodine maps). Diagnostic accuracy and confidence were assessed. Quantitative analysis of bowel wall enhancement was also performed. The number of correct diagnoses increased by 8% and 12% with unenhanced images and 6% and 13% with SIM for readers 1 and 2, respectively, compared to the portal phase only. There was an improvement in the confidence of the etiological diagnosis with the number of certain diagnoses increasing from 23% to 100%, which was statistically significant for reader 2 and of borderline significance for reader 1 (P = 0.002 and 0.052, respectively) when unenhanced phase and SIM were added. The inter-rater agreement improved when unenhanced and portal phase images were associated, compared to portal phase images alone (kappa = 0.652 [ICC=0.482-0.822] and 0.42 [ICC=0.241-0.607] respectively). SIM and unenhanced images improve the reproducibility and the diagnostic confidence to diagnose ischemic and inflammatory/infectious bowel wall thickening compared to portal phase images alone. The analysis of unenhanced and SIM images in association with portal phase images improves the reproducibility and the radiologist's confidence in the etiological diagnosis of acute non-traumatic bowel wall thickening in adults."

Despite the progress (availability of serum βhCG, USG and MRI), there are diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in the management. Up to 50% of ectopic pregnancies go undetected. Furthermore, cases seen as emergency with hemodynamic instability need urgent intervention with simultaneous arrangement of transport, blood transfusion and at times multidisciplinary team involvement. This is more challenging in a setting where resources are limited. To evaluate the outcome of women presenting with uncommon ectopic pregnancies as life-threatening emergency. Challenges encountered in diagnosis, pre-operative evaluation, decision for surgery and the procedure are presented. This is a series of twelve cases of uncommon ectopic pregnancies belonging to eight different types. These were managed under the first author during the period 2001 to 2019. Subjects were analyzed retrospectively. Diagnostic dilemma was faced in majority of the cases even with the use of ultrasonography. All the conceptions were spontaneous. Emergency surgical interventions were made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Five cases presented with massive hemoperitoneum. Blood transfusion was needed in nine cases. There was no mortality. One woman (case 4), with abdominal pregnancy, went home with a live baby, after the second laparotomy. Uncommon ectopic pregnancies are life-threatening conditions. Clinical acumen and an alert mind are of superior value in diagnosis. Investigations are supportive. Early diagnosis and intervention are lifesaving."

    "abstract": "Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare systemic necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized arteries. The most common gastrointestinal manifestation of PAN is postprandial abdominal pain from mesenteric arteritis causing bowel ischemia. When transmural ischemia develops, there may be ischemic necrosis and perforation of the bowel wall, which are life-threatening. Severe, life-threatening gastrointestinal involvement is relatively rare in pediatric PAN and may require different management in adult patients. We report a pediatric PAN case in a patient who presented with acute abdominal pain and superimposed cytomegalovirus enteritis with jejunoileal perforation. The patient improved with emergency small intestinal resection followed by conventional immunosuppressive drugs of a corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide, and anti-viral drugs. Before increasing the immunosuppressive drug dosage, initial screening of infectious cytomegalovirus and comprehensive evaluation for surgical conditions are essential in pediatric PAN with severe gastrointestinal involvement. Early aggressive treatment for acute abdomen is useful in reducing morbidity and mortality in pediatric PAN."

The microbiome is increasingly thought to play a key role in inflammatory disease of the bowel and similarly, may play a role in appendicitis. This study aimed to characterise the microbiome of adult acute appendicitis in a prospective cohort. We recruited 60 adults with acute appendicitis and 20 healthy controls. Rectal swabs were taken from each patient. After DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was carried out for analysis of diversity and taxonomic abundance. Phylogenetic sequencing of the samples indicated that there is a difference between the microbial composition of those with acute appendicitis and healthy controls, with a statistically significant decrease in alpha diversity in rectal swabs of appendicitis patients compared to healthy controls. At the genus level, we saw an increased abundance of potential pathogens, for example, Parvimonas and Acinetobacter, and a decrease in commensal taxa such as Faecalibacterium, Blautia and Lachnospiraceae in appendicitis patients compared to healthy controls. There was a reduction in diversity and loss of commensals in the microbiome of those with acute appendicitis, which may play a role in the cascade leading to acute appendicitis or the result of this."

The evolution was marked by the installation of abdominal distension with vomiting and alteration of the general state, the diagnosis of an intussusception in the jejunostomy tube was made in the abdominal CT scan, which required a surgical intervention, and reduction of intussusception, with simple after effects. Acute intestinal intussusception (IIA) secondary to jejunostomy tube placement is a rare abdominal emergency. It manifests with signs of upper gastrointestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is based on abdominal imaging by ultrasound or CT scan. Treatment is most often surgical (Chavrier et al., 1992) [1]. We present a very rare example of acute intestinal intussusception in adults, complicating jejunostomy, with non-specific clinical signs, which needed an early radiological diagnosis for adequate management."

    "abstract": "Adnexal torsion remains a diagnostic challenge heavily reliant on high clinical suspicion, with patient presentation and imaging used as adjuncts to aid in its diagnosis. This review summarizes diagnostic and management techniques of adnexal torsion to assist providers when encountering this surgical emergency. Common findings of adnexal torsion include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and adnexal mass or ovarian enlargement. An elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio may be useful for diagnosis. A 'whirlpool' sign, 'follicular ring' sign, enlarged/edematous ovary, and absent Doppler flow to the ovary are highly suggestive of adnexal torsion. Intraoperative visual diagnosis of ovarian death is highly inaccurate, with only 18-20% of ovaries necrotic on pathological examination. Necrotic appearing ovaries have been shown to have follicular activity on ultrasound one year postoperatively. Pelvic ultrasound remains the first-line imaging modality. In patients of reproductive age, we recommend performing detorsion with ovarian conservation, even in cases where the tissue appears necrotic, given poor intraoperative diagnostic rates of tissue death. Retention of ovarian function is also reliant on a timely diagnosis and intervention. We emphasize that the risk of ovarian damage/loss outweigh the risk of a diagnostic laparoscopy in patients of reproductive age."

Our study aimed to examine and compare the outcomes of benign ovarian cysts treated with elective laparoscopic surgery or emergency surgery during pregnancy. From 2004 to 2017, we treated 135 pregnant patients (110 elective and 25 emergencies) with benign ovarian cysts at our tertiary perinatal center and compared their surgical and perinatal outcomes. There was no significant difference in cyst diameter (7.6 ± 2.5 vs. 6.8 ± 2.1 cm), but cysts <6 cm were significantly more common in emergency (36%) than in elective (15%) cases. Mature teratomas were significantly more common in elective cases (89% vs. 52%) but corpus luteum cysts were more common in emergency cases (0% vs. 32%). The rates of laparoscopic surgery (98.2% vs. 52.0%) and ovarian conservation (99.1% vs. 80.0%) were significantly higher, and post-surgical hospitalization (4.6 ± 1.3 vs. 9.8 ± 10.5 days) was significantly shorter in elective than in emergency cases. There was no significant difference in the gestational age for delivery (38.9 ± 1.9 vs. 38.4 ± 2.7 weeks), preterm birth rate (12% vs. 20%), or birth weight (2939 ± 469 vs. 3019 ± 510 g). We cannot state that an emergency surgery during pregnancy is rarely required for small benign ovarian cysts. However, the surgical outcomes were significantly better for elective than for emergency surgery, with no difference in perinatal outcomes. If a benign ovarian cyst is found early in pregnancy, elective laparoscopic surgery may be considered with adequate informed consent."

    "abstract": "Pyometra is a rare gynecological condition and is characterized by pus accumulation in the uterine cavity. It occurs more frequently in postmenopausal women than tubo-ovarian abscesses, which constitute a more common gynecological complication among premenopausal women. A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency department with lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever for the last three days. The laboratory results were indicative to sepsis. The clinical examination revealed sensitivity by palpation of the lower abdomen without any signs of acute abdomen. The gynecological assessment showed pus outflow through the cervix and a pus culture was done. The ultrasound examination found an enlarged uterus, full of hypoechoic fluid, unclear borders between endometrium-myometrium, a mixed echogenicity adnexal mass and no free fluid in the pouch of Douglas. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed the presence of pyometra and a tubo-ovarian abscess of the right adnexa. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy. When the patient was hemodynamically stable and afebrile, she underwent ultrasound-guided dilatation and curettage of the cervical canal and the endometrium in order to exclude an underlying malignancy, under general anesthesia. The patient responded promptly to the intravenous antibiotic therapy which was adapted to the pus culture result. The laboratory results withdrew to normal values and the patient was discharged after fifteen days of hospitalization in an afebrile and hemodynamically stable condition. Pyometra and tubo-ovarian abscess in postmenopausal women could be a lethal complication of pelvic inflammatory disease. The key in treatment is the dilatation of the cervix and drainage of the pyometra. The administration of intravenous antibiotics and drainage through the cervix could be a suitable method of treatment for pyometra in older patients or those with poor performance status if only the histological examination is negative for malignancy. Pyometra ist eine seltene gynäkologische Erkrankung und wird als eine Eitersammlung im Uterus beschrieben. Sie wird in der Regel bei postmenopausalen Frauen diagnostiziert, im Gegensatz zum Tuboovarialabszess, der eine häufige Erkrankung bei prämenopausalen Frauen darstellt. Eine 72-jährige Frau stellte sich in der Notaufnahme mit unteren abdominellen Schmerzen, Diarrhöen und Fieber seit drei Tagen vorg. Die Laborergebnisse wiesen auf eine Sepsis hin. Die klinische Untersuchung zeigte einen eitrigen vaginalen Ausfluss, und ein vaginaler Abstrich wurde entnommen. Die Ultraschalluntersuchung zeigte einen vergrößerten Uterus, der mit echoarmer Flüssigkeit gefüllt war, das unscharf begrenzte Endometrium und einen inhomogenen Ovarialtumor ohne freie Flüssigkeit im Douglas. Die Computertomographie (CT) des Abdomens zeigte eine Pyometra und einen Tuboovarialabszess des rechten Ovars. Die Patientin wurde mit einer intravenösen, antibiotischen Therapie behandelt. Nach hämodynamischer Stabilisierung erfolgte die sonographisch gesteuerte Dilatation und Abrasio der Zervix und des Endometriums in Allgemeinanästhesie, um eine Malignität auszuschließen. Die Patientin hat rasch auf die intravenöse antibiotische Therapie angesprochen, die im Verlauf antibiogrammgerecht umgesetzt wurde. Die Laborwerte haben sich normalisiert und die Patientin konnte nach einem stationären Aufenthalt von 15 Tagen kardiopulmonal stabil und afebril entlassen werden. Pyometra und Tuboovarialabszess bei postmenopausalen Frauen kann eine letale Komplikation der entzündlichen Erkrankung des Beckens (PID) sein. Der wichtigste Punkt der Therapie ist die Dilatation der Zervix und die Entlastung des Eiters. Die Verabreichung einer antibiotischen Therapie und die Drainage kann die entsprechende Therapie von Pyometra bei älteren Patientinnen oder bei jenen mit eingeschränktem Gesundheitszustand sein, wenn die Histopathologie keinen Nachweis einer Malignität ergibt."

The treatment of patients experiencing Flood Syndrome is controversial, with a multitude of different treatments being proposed. This paper presents our experience in treating Flood syndrome, and presents a standardized way of treating these patients. Six consecutive patients with Flood syndrome were treated with the same standardized management and surgical technique. All patients had Cirrhosis (Child B and C). All were treated as open emergency operations, with no recurrence or post-operative complications. Though there is a lack of level I or II evidence, the data suggests that ruptured umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients are a surgical emergency that can be optimally managed with operative management. We present a standardized technique for the repair of these hernias which is simple, reliable and appears to have reproducible results. The technique aims to provide a hermetic seal immediately peri-operatively and is supported by medical optimization of the post-operative period. Our small case series represents effective and safe management in appropriately selected patients."

Retrospective study spread over a period of 3 years (2017-2019) concerning adult patients with trauma to the male external genitalia consulting in the surgical emergency and forensic medicine departments of the Ibn Rochd University Hospital Center in Casablanca. We collected 84 cases of TMEG within the framework of evaluation of bodily injury aimed at fixing the duration of Total Temporary Incapacity (TTI) and the rate of Permanent Partial Incapacity (PPI). There was a predominance of bursa trauma (85.7%) followed by penis trauma (14.5%). The average age of the patients was 39 years (17-61 years). Road accidents are the cause of 42% of cases. Regarding bursa trauma, the clinical symptomatology was dominated by pain (100%) and increased scrotal volume (50%). Scrotal ultrasound found the main lesion to be scrotal hematomas (35.71%) followed by ruptures of the tunica albuginea (9.5%). Surgical exploration was indicated in 45.23% of cases, of which (38%) was conservative treatment.For trauma to the penis, the clinical examination revealed 1 case of fracture of the cavernous body, a hematoma of the penis in only 1 patient, a superficial wound of the penis in 1 patient and the rest of the patients (9 cases) showed no lesions. Surgical treatment was indicated in only one patient. The average duration of temporary total incapacity was 17.5 days and the average rate of partial permanent incapacity was 4%. Physicians who are experts in the evaluation of bodily injury are frequently confronted with the evaluation of the damage resulting from the TMEG. The medico-legal evaluation of these traumas remains difficult and very varied requiring a perfect knowledge of the mechanisms of these traumas, of the therapeutic and evolutionary principles helping in the judicial decision."

    "abstract": "Digestive cancers are frequent and of late diagnosis in Africa. Palliative surgery therefore plays an important role. Our objective is to describe its indications, techniques and results in primary digestive cancers. Retrospective, bicentric, descriptive study of palliative surgery for primary digestive cancer, performed in Ouagadougou over the last twelve years. The results were assessed according to the degree of improvement in the patients' quality of life. We divided the patients into four groups according to the improvement of the quality of life after the operation. The results were considered very satisfactory when the symptoms disappeared completely. They were considered satisfactory when the symptoms decreased in intensity. They were unsatisfactory when the symptoms kept the same intensity. They were considered poor when the symptoms persisted with greater intensity. Six hundred and thirty-nine palliative digestive cancer surgeries were performed. All patients had clinical symptoms deteriorating their quality of life (56.7%) or even a surgical emergency (43.3%). Biliodigestive diversion, gastroentero-anastomosis and colostomy were the palliative procedures performed respectively in 26.6%, 16.9%, and 34.1%. Complications were noted in 11.7%. These were digestive fistulas in 9 cases, retraction and stomal prolapse in 11 cases. The improvement of the quality of life was very satisfactory in 76%. Palliative surgery is widely practiced in digestive cancers. It improves the quality of life. African surgeons should be aware and well-educated to safely perform surgical palliative procedures."

    "title": "Immediate coiling of a gastroduodenal arterial bleeding in a case of haemorrhagic shock without haematemesis, a case report.",
    "abstract": "and importance: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is common in the clinic. In combination with haemorrhagic shock, morbidity is high. Rapid diagnosis and treatment can save lives. With the introduction of precision imaging several treatment options are feasible. Up-to-date diagnosis and treatment requires expertise from interventional radiology, gastroenterology and surgery to form a dedicated intervention team. This is illustrated by a typical case. We report a 78-year-old otherwise healthy male with a severe diverticulum bleeding. He was initially diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Approximately 60 minutes after CT scanning, he became haemodynamically instable. He also vomited coffee-like fluid but no clear blood or clots. A repeated CT scan showed active bleeding in the retroperitoneal space highly suspicious for a diverticular bleeding just outside the lumen of the duodenum. An acute multidisciplinary intervention team immediately decided not to perform endoscopy (according to the upper GI bleeding guidelines) but to extend the imaging procedure with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). By this time, active bleeding from a side branch of the gastroduodenal artery was noted and successfully coiled. Guidelines determine day-to-day management in clinical medicine. Still, there is an exception to every rule. The case presented here was typical of upper GI bleeding with haemodynamic instability and signs of shock, but without haematemesis. This combination indicated a bleeding from somewhere outside the lumen of the GI tract. Instead of endoscopy, the acute intervention team decided to perform CT angiography (CTa) with subsequent DSA. On imaging, the bleeding focus was immediately identified and treated by coiling. Performance of CTa immediately followed by DSA and no endoscopy was decided by an acute intervention team in a patient with upper GI bleeding and haemorrhagic shock. Swift coiling of the bleeding artery outside the GI tract lumen was successful. The team in charge relied on a hybrid multifunctional unit fully equipped to perform interventional radiologic as well as GI procedures."

    "abstract": "Although the risk of trauma in space is low, unpredictable events can occur that may require surgical treatment. Hemorrhage can be a life-threatening condition while traveling to another planet and after landing on it. These exploration missions call for a different approach than rapid return to Earth, which is the policy currently adopted on the International Space Station (ISS) in low Earth orbit (LEO). Consequences are difficult to predict, given the still scarce knowledge of human physiology in such environments. Blood loss in space can deplete the affected astronaut's physiological reserves and all stored crew supplies. In this review, we will describe different aspects of hemorrhage in space, and by comparison with terrestrial conditions, the possible solutions to be adopted, and the current state of the art."

    "title": "Testicular torsion during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of a multicenter study in northern Italy.",
    "abstract": "The literature reported an increased avoidance of the Emergency Department (ED) during COrona VIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, causing a subsequent increase of morbidity and mortality for acute conditions. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, which can lead to the loss of the affected testicle if a delayed treatment occurs. As testicular loss is time-related, outcome was hypothesized to be negatively affected by the pandemic. The aim is to investigate whether presentation, treatment and outcomes of children with testicular torsion were delayed during COVID-19. Medical records of pediatric patients operated for testicular torsion of six Paediatric Surgical Units in Northern Italy between January 2019 and December 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided as for ones treated during (dC) or before the pandemic (pC). To reflect possible seasonality, related to lockdown restrictions, winter and summer calendar blocks were also analysed. For all cohorts, demographic data, pre-operative evaluation, operative notes and post-operative outcomes were reviewed. Primary outcomes were referral time, time from diagnosis to surgery and ischemic time, while secondary outcomes were orchiectomy and atrophy rates. Statistic was conducted as appropriate. A total of 188 patients with acute testicular torsion were included in the study period, 89 in the pre-COVID-19 (pC) period and 99 during COVID-19 (dC). Time from symptom onset to the access to the Emergency Department (T1) was not different among the two populations (pC: 5,5 h, dC: 6 h, p 0.374), and similarly time from diagnosis to surgery (pC: 2,5 h, dC: 2,5 h, p 0.970) and ischemic time (pC: 8,2 h, dC: 10 h, p 0.655). T1 was <6 h in 46/99 patients (46%) pC and 45/89 patients (51%) dC (p = 0.88, Fisher's exact test). Subgroup analysis accounting for different lockdown measures, confirm the absence of any difference. Orchiectomies rate was 23% (23/99) dC and 21% (19/89) pC (p = 0.861, Fisher's exact test) and rate of post-operative atrophy was 9% dC (7/76) and 14% pC (10/70), p = 0,44, Fisher's exact test. Despite worldwide pediatric ED accesses reduction, we reported that neither ischemic time nor the long-term outcomes in children with testicular torsion increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the available literature, few studies investigated the topic and are controversial on the results. Similarly to our findings, some studies found that timing and orchiectomy rates were not significantly different during the pandemic, while others reported a correlation to pandemic seasonality. Furthermore, in the recent pediatric literature it has been reported a delayed testicular torsion diagnosis due to shame in informing parents. Strengths of this study are the large numerosity, its multicentric design and a long study period. Its main limitation is being retrospective. We reported our large cohort from one of the most heavily COVID-19-affected regions, finding that referral, intra-hospital protocols and ischemic time in testicular torsion were not increased during to the pandemic, as well as orchiectomy rate and atrophy."

    "abstract": "Water-borne infections like typhoid fever are common in the developing world. The emergence of extensively drug-resistant Salmonella typhi (XDR S. typhi) is of great concern for both local and global public health. Fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are the commonest manifestations of typhoid fever. Abdominal pain may be due to ileal and colonic inflammation/ulceration and mesenteric lymphadenitis. Sometimes, abdominal pain in typhoid is due to ileal perforation leading to peritonitis, and acute appendicitis which needs urgent surgical intervention. Delayed surgical intervention can result in morbidity and sometimes even death. We report a case of XDR S. typhi infection in a 17-year-old female who presented with fever and abdominal pain. During the course of the hospital stay, while she was on appropriate antibiotics, her abdominal pain worsened due to acute appendicitis. She underwent an appendectomy and had an uneventful recovery. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of acute appendicitis caused by XDR S. typhi. Although appropriate antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for typhoid fever, physicians should be mindful that surgical consultation may be necessary in certain cases."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common etiologies of an acute abdomen in the emergency department and first-line standard surgical care for the condition has recently been reconsidered. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes of surgical intervention versus non-operative antibiotic therapy in the treatment of acute appendicitis in adult and pediatric patients. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE. The search included all studies until January 15th, 2022. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity. Data were independently extracted by the authors of the study. Meta-analysis was performed and Cohen's Q test for heterogeneous effects was performed to determine if fixed or random-effects models were appropriate for use. Twelve randomized controlled trials investigating a total of 3703 acute appendicitis patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. In the systematic review, eleven RCTs demonstrated that appendectomy had improved effectiveness compared to non-operative antibiotic management. The meta-analysis demonstrated that patients undergoing appendectomy had significantly higher treatment effectiveness compared with antibiotics-only treatment (98.4% vs. 73.3%, P < .0001). The meta-analysis did demonstrate a significant .54-day reduction in hospital length of stay for the appendectomy group compared to the non-operative antibiotic therapy group. Surgical intervention is associated with increased effectiveness of treatment and reduced in-hospital length of stay among patients with acute appendicitis. Guidelines established by institutions and surgical organizations should indicate appendectomy as the standard and superior treatment option for patients presenting with acute appendicitis."

    "title": "Acute Abdomen from Spontaneous Splenic Artery Rupture with Coincidental Metastatic Disease: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Splenic artery rupture is a rare surgical occurrence, often with fatal results. The reported prevalence is 0.1-0.2%. Splenic artery rupture can be from atraumatic or traumatic causes. Clinical presentation can vary from being asymptomatic to having an acute abdomen presentation if the splenic artery ruptures. Various imaging studies such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and Doppler ultrasound can be used to determine the morphology and location of the aneurysm. Surgical treatment options are aneurysm resection or simple ligation and splenectomy. CASE REPORT We present the case of an 84-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department after having an episode of syncope. Upon admission, the patient had an acute rupture of the splenic artery aneurysm with large-volume hemoperitoneum, with extensive hepatic and periportal nodal metastases. Interventional radiology was immediately consulted for an emergent splenic artery embolization. He then underwent a liver biopsy, showing poorly differentiated carcinoma, with elevated AFP, CA 19-9, and CEA. The patient was discharged, and was scheduled to follow up with gastroenterology for an outpatient colonoscopy and with oncology for further staging and treatment. CONCLUSIONS This is a rare case where a patient had an acute splenic artery rupture with underlying hepatic and periportal metastasis, with a primary within the gastroenterology tract, specifically the colon. It is imperative to consider splenic artery aneurysm as a differential diagnosis in patients who present with acute abdomen. This case will bring to light a traumatic cause leading to a delayed diagnosis of metastatic malignancy, with the colon as the primary location."

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen is a rare condition and defined as the spleen that is not in its normal anatomical position due to lack or laxity of suspensory ligaments. Etiological factors are congenital and acquired. Splenic torsion, infraction, and rupture are life-threatening complications of wandering spleen. A 14-year-old girl patient presented to the emergency department with severe pain abdomen for 2 days. On physical examination, a large palpable mass in the mid of the abdomen was found, and CECT confirmed it as torsion of wandering spleen. Emergency exploration is done and splenectomy was done due to non-viability of the spleen. The Post-op period was uneventful. Acute torsion of wandering spleen is an extremely rare clinical entity and patient present in an emergency with clinical features of acute abdomen. They may also present with chronic pain abdomen and abdominal mass. Early diagnosis is vital for the preservation of the spleen. Radiological studies have an important role in an accurate diagnosis. Surgery is the gold standard treatment of wandering spleen. Surgery for splenopexy or splenectomy depends on the condition of the spleen during surgery. Timely diagnosis and interventions are crucial to prevent life-threatening complications of wandering spleen."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen secondary to pyometrocolpos as a result of microperforate hymen in an 18-month-old child is extremely rare to witness. Such a child was admitted with a history of poor appetite, lethargy, high-grade febrile episodes, frequent urination, and multiple episodes of vomiting in seven days. There was no relief of symptoms on oral antibiotics. On careful examination, the abdomen was distended. A suprapubic bulge with mild tenderness was palpable. Genital examination revealed the absence of vaginal introitus with a bulging membrane. Ultrasound showed the presence of echogenic contents within the dilated uterine and vaginal cavities. An emergency hymenotomy drained 150 cc of malodorous purulent material. Symptoms were relieved post-surgery. This, to our knowledge, being the youngest case of microperforate hymen presenting with acute abdomen makes it worth reporting."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation is a surgical emergency that is associated with a high mortality rate and requires special care. During the pandemic, there has been competition with COVID-19 patients for health resources, especially ICU bed availability. The primary aim of our study was to compare the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases registered before the pandemic. A retrospective, observational, single center, cohort study was conducted that included patients that underwent emergency surgery for gastrointestinal perforation in the periods during the pandemic (6 months) and before the pandemic (12 months). Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, duration of hospital and ICU stay, status at discharge, and perforation site were compared. The study included 67 subjects (33 in the pre-pandemic period and 34 in the pandemic period). There were no significant differences regarding sex, age, or comorbidity. The perforation rate per emergency intervention was 4-times higher during the pandemic. There was an increase in the number of patients that were foreigners (4 [11%]) and nonresidents (6 [17%]). ICU admissions decreased (6 [19%]) but ICU stay increased to 137 h. Hospital stay increased by 5 days and delay in care increased 4.5 h. The number of deaths was higher (from 5 [15.2%] to 10 [29.4%]). Four patients with perforations were positive for COVID-19, were admitted to the ICU, and died. During the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal perforations at our healthcare system area; symptoms were more advanced, and mortality was higher. La perforación gastrointestinal es una emergencia quirúrgica asociada a una alta mortalidad que precisa cuidados avanzados. Durante la pandemia ha competido con los pacientes de COVID-19 por los recursos sanitarios, especialmente por la disponibilidad de camas en UCI. El objetivo principal del estudio fue comparar la incidencia de perforación gastrointestinal durante la pandemia por COVID-19 con los casos registrados en prepandemia. Estudio retrospectivo observacional de cohortes unicéntrico, que incluyó a los pacientes intervenidos de urgencia por perforación gastrointestinal en periodos de pandemia (seis meses) y prepandemia (12 meses). Se compararon características sociodemográficas, comorbilidad, tiempos de ingreso hospitalario y en UCI, situación al alta y localización de la perforación. Se incluyeron a 67 sujetos (33 en prepandemia y 34 en pandemia). No hubo diferencias significativas con respecto al sexo, edad o comorbilidad. La razón de tasas de perforación por intervenciones urgentes fue cuatro veces mayor durante la pandemia. Aumentaron el número de extranjeros; 4 (11%) y no residentes; 6 (17%). Los ingresos en UCI disminuyeron (6 [19%]), aunque su estancia se prolongó 137 horas. La estancia hospitalaria aumentó 5 días y la demora en la atención 4.5 horas. Aumentaron las perforaciones de intestino grueso (3 [8%]). La mortalidad fue mayor; 10 (29.4%) frente a 5 (15.2%). Hubo cuatro pacientes perforados COVID-19 positivos, todos ellos fueron a UCI y fallecieron. Durante la pandemia por COVID-19 hubo un aumento de la incidencia de perforaciones gastrointestinales en nuestra área de atención, con cuadros más evolucionados y mayor mortalidad."

    "abstract": "Marginal ulcers are a recognized complication of gastric bypass procedures for obesity. Perforated marginal ulcer (PMU) is a life-threatening complication of marginal ulcers. We performed a systematic review to understand the presentation, management, and outcomes of PMUs. PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase databases were searched to identify all studies on PMUs after gastric bypass procedures. A total of 610 patients were identified from 26 articles. The mean age was 39.8±2.59 years, and females represented most of the cohort (67%). The mean body mass index was 43.2±5.67 kg/m2. Most of the patients had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (98%). The time gap between the primary bariatric surgery and the diagnosis of PMU was 27.5±8.56 months. The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (99.5%) and a computed tomography scan was the diagnostic modality used in 72% of the patients. Only 15% of patients were on prophylactic proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers at the time of perforation, and 41% of patients were smoking at the time. Twenty-three percent of patients were on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Laparoscopic omental patch repair of the perforation (59%) was the most used technique; 18% of patients underwent open surgery, and 20% were managed non-surgically. Thirty-day mortality was 0.97%; it was 1.21% (n=5) and 0% (n=0) in those who were managed surgically and nonsurgically, respectively. Ulcers recurred in 5% of patients. In conclusion, PMU is a surgical emergency after gastric bypass that can result in significant morbidity and even mortality. This is the first systematic review in scientific literature characterizing this condition."

    "abstract": "Pediatric septic arthritis is a surgical emergency and timely diagnosis prevents serious complications. To differentiate between septic hip and transient synovitis, the predictive value of four original Kocher criteria (fever, inability to bear weight, elevated serum white blood cell count, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate) plus Caird's addition of elevated C-reactive protein have been studied, termed the modified Kocher criteria. These criteria have not been tested extensively on septic knee. This study tested the utility of the modified Kocher criteria in predicting septic knee while validating it for septic hip. A retrospective chart review was conducted of pediatric patients evaluated at a single institution for irritable hip or knee between 2009 and 2018. Patients who underwent arthrocentesis were included and the modified Kocher criteria were applied to all. One hundred fifty-five patients (96 hips and 59 knees) were identified. One hundred four (67.1%) patients had septic arthritis with 44/59 (74.6%) of knees and 60/96 (62.5%) of hips. The strongest predictors for septic hip and knee were elevated C-reactive protein (odds ratio = 26.9, p < 0.0001) and refusal to bear weight (odds ratio = 14.5, p < 0.0001), respectively. For hips, 5/5 criteria produced a 100% positive predictive value for septic arthritis. For knees, the combination of inability to bear weight and elevated C-reactive protein had a positive predictive value of 89.7%. While all five of the modified Kocher criteria are not predictive of pediatric septic knee, the combination of two specific factors (inability to bear weight and elevated C-reactive protein) is strongly predictive. This study validates previous work that the modified Kocher criteria are predictive of septic hip. level III."

    "abstract": "Ovarian small cell carcinomas are a rare type of ovarian cancer that is highly aggressive and consists of two distinct types the hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and pulmonary type (SCCOPT). A 23 years old girl was admitted to the emergency room with the presentation of acute abdomen. The ultrasound and Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right adnexal huge mass with adnexal torsion. In laparotomy, she underwent unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy due to ovarian torsion and possible malignancy. The histopathological evaluation was challenging and was finalized by a team of pathologists as hypercalcemic small cell carcinoma. She refused reoperation and unfortunately relapsed during chemotherapy and died 6 months after the initial diagnosis. Conclusion: We do not yet have comprehensive information on small cell ovarian cancer. Cytopathology diagnosis is still challenging and the treatments are not usually effective. Further clinical trials and studies are recommended to find appropriate treatments for these patients."

    "abstract": "Mature cystic teratoma is the most common type of ovarian tumor in children. Adnexal torsion is the main complication of mature ovarian teratoma. The synchronous bilateral incidence of mature cystic teratoma in premenarchal girls is known to be rare. However, the incidence of adnexal torsion is higher in young girls. A 10-year-old girl presenting with acute abdomen was managed by emergency laparotomy. Bilateral mature ovarian teratoma with adnexal torsion of the right ovary was found. The right ovarian tissue was not viable due to torsion and an oophorectomy was necessary. Cystectomy with preservation of the ovarian tissue of the left ovary was performed. Histopathological diagnosis was bilateral synchronous mature teratoma with necrosis of the right adnexa. Although the risk of malignancy of torsed ovaries and mature teratomas in premenarchal girls is low, their removal is recommended to prevent adnexal torsion. Decision between ovarian tissue sparing surgery or oophorectomy depends on the risk of malignancy, fertility preservation and the avoidance of early menopause."

    "abstract": "Hospital-day-care surgery is currently a priority for the healthcare system and is booming due to its' favorable financial impact. In gynecology, the management of surgical interventions for patients who've come to the Hospital Emergency Department, could in a number of cases, be delayed for a few h or several days. It would be it possible to organize a specific hospital day-care management program for the delayed surgeries. The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of hospital day-care management of delayed gynecological emergencies. This is a prospective, observational, unicentric study performed in the gynecological department of a teaching hospital from January 2016 through March 2017. Women having gynecological emergencies requiring surgical management were included in this study. The leading causes for surgical management and thus for inclusion in this study were nonviable pregnancies or retained products of conception, vulvar or breast abscesses, ectopic pregnancies and complications of ovarian cysts. For women with emergencies that could be delayed, surgery was scheduled between 12 h and 12 days after a woman's initial emergency examination at the hospital. Postoperative consultation was at the emergency department or completed by the referring physician. Re-hospitalization and re-intervention rates were collected 6 to 8 weeks after the initial emergency management. Three hundred and forty-eight women requiring surgical management consulted for gynecological emergencies over the period of the study. One hundred and eighty-one (52%) were managed in delayed day-care. The rate of surgical emergency management between the initial emergency consultation and the delayed day-care surgery was 1.8%. The consultation rate of a return to the emergency department prior to the planned delayed day-care was 12.2% (21/171). The rate of unplanned re-admissions in the month following surgery was 1.8% (3/171). The overall Satisfaction rate was high (170/171 99.4%). The delayed surgical management of gynecological emergencies thus seems feasible and beneficial for both women and the healthcare system. An economic evaluation could be performed to evaluate the lower costs/savings for delayed day-care management of gynecological emergencies."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute appendicitis is by far the most common surgical emergency encountered in the United States and with this in mind, unusual presentations are also frequent, thus improper diagnosis, which roughly occurs in 20-40% of cases, can lead to a delayed treatment and bad outcomes. We present this unusual case of abdominal pain secondary to extraperitoneal compartmentalized abscess following perforated appendicitis, diagnosed and managed as ascites secondary to alcoholic liver cirrhosis with subsequent delay in the treatment of the underlying cause, which was appendicitis. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with pain and distention for 1 week duration, who was treated with frequent paracentesis, with worsening pain following the latest drainage, raising suspicion of perforated viscus. Initial abdominal X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed free air and large tubular fluid sac collection along the right, left, and lower abdominal wall. Surgical drainage of the abscess was performed. A subsequent follow-up CT with oral contrast of the abdomen revealed perforated right lower abdominal viscus, possible perforated appendicitis with pre-peritoneal and retroperitoneal space occupying the abscess cavity compartmentalized along the right, left, and lower abdominal wall and creating a separate space where the inflammatory purulent material was collected. This was followed by a second procedure for ileocecectomy and ileostomy with excision of the extra-preperitoneal compartment space. CONCLUSIONS Abdominal pain secondary to acute appendicitis is by far the commonest surgical condition; therefore, it should be considered high in the differential diagnosis of any patients presenting with unusual abdominal complaints."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health-care system unpredictably. Restrictions and precautions have had a significant impact on the volume and nature of admissions in emergency services. In this study, we hypothesized that the pandemic would result in a change in the number of emergencies admitted to the general surgery inpatient service and a worse patient outcome compared to the previous year. A retrospective analysis of emergency general surgical admissions during the first 6 months of the pandemic and the same period in 2019 was conducted. Demographics, laboratory assessments, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and postoperative out-comes were analyzed. 761 patients were admitted to the general surgery service during two 6-month periods (392 vs. 369, respectively). This represented a 5.9% reduction in admissions. However, in the first 2 months of the pandemic, the number of emergency general surgical admissions decreased by 37.1% and 43.7%, respectively. Comparison of periods demonstrated no significant differences in demograph-ics, laboratory values, incidence of emergencies, treatment strategies, and hospital stay. Acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, and bowel obstruction were the three most common surgical emergencies in the pandemic. However, there was no significant difference in outcomes between the periods when each surgical emergency was evaluated separately. Pandemic appears to affect general surgical admissions with a fluctuating pattern, an increasing trend following a sig-nificant 2-month decrease. These findings suggest that patients presented with a delayed presentation; however, contrary to concerns, there was no difference in patient outcomes between the two periods. This study provides a perspective in management strategies for surgical emergencies in such unusual conditions."

Abdominal imaging was inconclusive, exploratory laparoscopy showed four-quadrant peritonitis. No provoking factor could be withheld. Due to clinical deterioration the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Blood cultures showed the presence of group A streptococcus, and clindamycin was associated. She recovered, and could be discharged after several days. Peritonitis caused by group A Streptococcus pyogenes is rare in healthy individuals, and occurs mostly in middle-aged women. There is no consensus regarding surgical treatment but surgical exploration is often necessary to exclude secondary peritonitis. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive measurements remain the cornerstone in patient management. Association of clindamycin has been shown to reduce mortality.

Less than half of participants 46.7% received training on breaking bad news, and only 13.3% received training on non-physical breaking bad news. More than half of participants mentioned that showing empathy is the area that needs improvement the most. High proportion of physicians lacks the necessary skills to break bad news, especially using non-physical ways during the pandemic. Well-structured programs are needed for the training of healthcare providers on breaking bad news, with certain adaptations for traditional protocols to be appropriate for telephone or video conferencing."

    "abstract": "We hereby describe a case of an acutely ill 41-year-old male without any medical history who presented with an acute abdomen in the emergency department. An abdominal CT showed a dissection of the coeliac trunk and infarction of the spleen. Because of a presumed diagnosis of vasculitis he was started on high dose IV steroids. However, after additional testing the diagnosis of segmental arteriolar Mediolysis (SAM) was made. In this case report we describe the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of this patient and provide the readers with background about common differential diagnosis and criteria for diagnosing SAM."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is defined as twisting of the ovary around an axis consisting of its vascular pedicle, the infundibulopelvic ligament and the tubo-ovarian ligament, and can occur in females of any age. Torsion can be a result of ovarian mass causing asymmetry and subsequent torsion, or can be spontaneous. While ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, early diagnosis and treatment can preserve ovarian viability even if necrosis is seen operatively. Presentation classically involves sudden onset severe abdominal pain and vomiting but diagnostic delay can follow subtler presentations. Diagnosis is most commonly based on sonographic findings, but advanced imaging such as CT or MRI may be required if sonography is not diagnostic. Treatment is surgical, with ovarian preservation preferred in almost all cases. In this review, I present the most recent evidence on epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of pediatric ovarian torsion, with a focus on point-of-care ultrasound for the emergency care provider."

Although ITB is generally a chronic-wasting condition, it can also occur as acute abdomen representing an absolute surgical emergency. Although caseation and necrosis in granulomas can be used for diagnosis of ITB, preoperative diagnosis is still challenging. Endoscopic biopsies targeted to ulcerous lesions could be an essential diagnostic tool, contrary to those targeted to the ulcers' edges as performed in CD."

This is a case report of a delayed presentation of an ileal perforation and concurrent faecal peritonitis presented as an acute abdomen, resultant from an ingested fishbone, which led to fatality despite urgent laparotomy. Perforations following ingested foreign bodies are frequently unanticipated clinically, and diagnosed during advanced imaging studies or surgical interventions. Endoscopy, laparoscopy, and laparotomy have been used during surgical management in reported cases; however, prior early identification is pivotal for good outcomes as delayed presentations and delayed diagnosis carry a poorer prognosis. Despite fish bones being frequent foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract and the majority causing no life-threatening adverse effects, they are the leading foreign bodies instigating gastrointestinal perforations. A high degree of suspicion is required when attending to patients with suspected gastrointestinal perforations and absent typical findings in routine imaging, where fish bones could be the aetiology."

During the pandemic of COVID-19, besides respiratory complications, the virus was causing venous and arterial thromboembolism that can lead to acute mesenteric ischaemia in otherwise healthy individuals. Early diagnosis and suitable surgical procedures are the key to the better outcome of this disease. Surgical resection of gangrenous gut, leaving healthy gut is an important step of this operation. Leaving less than 200 cm of small intestine leads to short bowel syndrome which has got its own complication. This case report is on a healthy COVID-19 positive patient who presented with acute mesenteric ischaemia. After surgical resection only 1.5 feet small bowel (60 cm) was left behind and anastomosis was done with healthy transverse colon.

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Malignant neoplasms are common causes of acute pleuropericardial effusion. Pleuropericarditis denotes poor patient prognosis, is associated with shortened average survival time, and represents a surgical emergency. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the impact of two minimally invasive surgical approaches, the type of cancer, and other clinical variables on the mortality of 338 patients with pleuropericarditis admitted to an emergency hospital in Romania between 2009 and 2020. All patients underwent minimally invasive surgeries to prevent the recurrence of the disease and to increase their life expectancy. Log-rank tests were used to check for survival probability differences by surgical approach. We also applied univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to assess the effect of each covariate. Results: No significant differences were found in the 2-year overall survival rate between patients who underwent the two types of surgery. The multivariate Cox proportional regression model adjusted for relevant covariates showed that age, having lung cancer, and a diagnosis of pericarditis and right pleural effusion increased the mortality risk. The surgical approach was not associated with mortality in these patients. Conclusion: These findings open up avenues for future research to advance the understanding of survival among patients with pleuropericarditis."

MH is caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, as is rhabdomyolysis triggered by exertion and/or pyrexia. The discrepancy between the prevalence of risk genotypes and actual MH incidence remains unexplained. We investigated the role of pre-operative exercise and pyrexia as potential MH modifying factors. We included cases from 5 MH referral centers with 1) clinical features suggestive of MH, 2) confirmation of MH susceptibility on Contracture Testing (IVCT or CHCT) and/or RYR1 genetic testing, and a history of 3) strenuous exercise within 72 h and/or pyrexia >37.5 °C prior to the triggering anesthetic. Characteristics of MH-triggering agents, surgery and succinylcholine use were collected. We identified 41 cases with general anesthesias resulting in an MH event (GA+MH, n = 41) within 72 h of strenuous exercise and/or pyrexia. We also identified previous general anesthesias without MH events (GA-MH, n = 51) in the index cases and their MH susceptible relatives. Apart from pre-operative exercise and/or pyrexia, trauma and acute abdomen as surgery indications, emergency surgery and succinylcholine use were also more common with GA+MH events. These observations suggest a link between pre-operative exercise, pyrexia and MH."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children. Diagnosis and management are often straightforward. However, familial Mediterranean fever is an important condition to consider in the assessment of children with acute abdominal pain, particularly in children with an origin in eastern Mediterranean basin where the disease is common. The key feature of familial Mediterranean fever is relapsing episodes of fever and serositis including peritonitis, pleurisy, or arthritis. The disease is treated with colchicine that prevents acute attacks, control subclinical inflammation between the attacks and the long-term complication of amyloidosis. The acute attacks may be a challenge to identify and distinguish from other causes of acute abdomen, including acute appendicitis, but also small bowel obstruction. Ultrasound and CT scan findings are nonspecific during acute attacks of familial Mediterranean fever, but imaging is useful to identify acute appendicitis and small bowel obstruction. The purpose of this article was to increase the awareness and knowledge of familial Mediterranean fever and provide support for the paediatric surgeon in the clinical care of these children in parts of the world where familial Mediterranean fever is rare."

    "abstract": "Coronary reperfusion therapies have led to a reduction in the incidence of mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but the associated mortality of these complications has remained high. Ventricular septal rupture is the most common mechanical complication after myocardial infarction and occurs in approximately 0.21% with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and in 0.04% with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Surgery is the only definitive treatment but it is associated with high operative mortality and morbidity and, in some centers, alternative treatment with mechanical support of circulation and trans-catheter closure of the defect is being used. We continue to believe that immediate surgery offers the best opportunity for long-term survival. Patients should be taken directly to the operating room or via the heart catheterization laboratory if the coronary artery anatomy is unknown. This should be done as soon as the diagnosis is made, as acute rupture of the interventricular septum is a surgical emergency. The operative technique of infarct exclusion has been our preferred method and when performed in hemodynamically stable patients, the operative mortality is around 10%, although much higher in patients in cardiogenic shock. Patch dehiscence and persistent shunts are uncommon after closure of the defect using this technique. Delaying operative intervention in hemodynamically stable patients frequently leads to cardiogenic shock and multi-organ failure. Transcatheter closure of these acute septal lesions is complex, not necessarily feasible in all patients, and there is no evidence that the results are superior to surgery."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency admissions. Even though initial differentials are wide, a physician is able to narrow them down with detailed history, careful physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests along with imaging studies. Unfortunately, some of the cases do not have an established diagnosis despite multiple blood work and imaging studies in the emergency department. In such conditions, physicians' recognition of rare diseases generally avoids extra costs for additional investigations, unnecessary consultations, and most importantly wasting valuable time in life-threatening conditions in emergency settings. Here, we report a 30-year-old woman with acute severe abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability who was found to have ascites that was actually hemoperitoneum secondary to spontaneous primary non-parasitic splenic cyst rupture. The primary splenic cyst is an extremely rare entity and is often found on imaging incidentally. A few case reports regarding primary splenic cyst and its complications were published in the literature. Since it is an exceptionally uncommon condition, there is no consensus on treatment. We aimed to increase the understanding of spontaneous primary splenic cyst rupture and its management among healthcare providers with this case report."

The main pathological feature is the presence of air-filled cysts in the intestinal submucosa, intermuscular wall, and subserous membrane. Conservative treatment is the first choice when no serious complications are present, whereas timely surgical treatment is needed for serious and life-threatening complications. This report presents the clinical and pathological analysis of PCI in a man in his early 90s. The patient was hospitalized because of acute abdomen and diagnosed with perforation of the sigmoid colon due to PCI with schistosomiasis after emergency surgery. Emergency partial sigmoid colon resection and permanent colostomy were performed under general anesthesia. Preoperative diagnosis of PCI is difficult because of the nonspecific clinical manifestations and endoscopic findings, and missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis easily occur. Pure PCI has no specific symptoms and does not require special treatment, and there is a lack of special treatment methods in clinical practice. However, when PCI is combined with other intestinal diseases such as schistosomiasis enteropathy, intestinal perforation is likely to occur, leading to severe acute abdomen with the need for prompt surgical treatment."

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still ongoing and a major challenge for health care services worldwide. In the first WSES COVID-19 emergency surgery survey, a strong negative impact on emergency surgery (ES) had been described already early in the pandemic situation. However, the knowledge is limited about current effects of the pandemic on patient flow through emergency rooms, daily routine and decision making in ES as well as their changes over time during the last two pandemic years. This second WSES COVID-19 emergency surgery survey investigates the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on ES during the course of the pandemic. A web survey had been distributed to medical specialists in ES during a four-week period from January 2022, investigating the impact of the pandemic on patients and septic diseases both requiring ES, structural problems due to the pandemic and time-to-intervention in ES routine. 367 collaborators from 59 countries responded to the survey. The majority indicated that the pandemic still significantly impacts on treatment and outcome of surgical emergency patients (83.1% and 78.5%, respectively). As reasons, the collaborators reported decreased case load in ES (44.7%), but patients presenting with more prolonged and severe diseases, especially concerning perforated appendicitis (62.1%) and diverticulitis (57.5%). Otherwise, approximately 50% of the participants still observe a delay in time-to-intervention in ES compared with the situation before the pandemic. Relevant causes leading to enlarged time-to-intervention in ES during the pandemic are persistent problems with in-hospital logistics, lacks in medical staff as well as operating room and intensive care capacities during the pandemic. This leads not only to the need for triage or transferring of ES patients to other hospitals, reported by 64.0% and 48.8% of the collaborators, respectively, but also to paradigm shifts in treatment modalities to non-operative approaches reported by 67.3% of the participants, especially in uncomplicated appendicitis, cholecystitis and multiple-recurrent diverticulitis. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic still significantly impacts on care and outcome of patients in ES. Well-known problems with in-hospital logistics are not sufficiently resolved by now; however, medical staff shortages and reduced capacities have been dramatically aggravated over last two pandemic years."

    "abstract": "Surgically curable illnesses in the pediatric population are a major public health issue with a high prevalence of 10%-33% of all pediatric admissions, and emergency situations account for 50%-78% of surgical cases. Emergency abdominal surgery in children necessitates proper and prompt surgical and perioperative supportive care. When compared to elective operations, emergency surgery has a greater rate of morbidity and fatality. Staffing concerns, access to operating theaters, and access to diagnostic investigations are all possible causes of this high fatality rate, in addition to patient-related factors. Literature from high-income countries (HICs) discusses the problem, and recommendations are available for high-quality setups with good infrastructure. However, surgical care facilities from resource-poor countries have altogether different challenges and bottlenecks when dealing with children requiring emergency surgical operative procedures to save lives. This review aims to discuss factors affecting the survival of children being operated on for abdominal emergencies in resource-poor setups and suggest recommendations."

    "abstract": "Background Albumin is a negative acute-phase protein as its levels fall after injury, sepsis, and surgical stress. A review of the literature suggests that serum albumin level drops rapidly after surgery in adults and correlates well with the outcomes. However, there is limited data on the use of peri-operative fall in serum albumin levels as an outcome predictor in children undergoing emergency abdominal surgeries. We aim to investigate the correlation between the degree of peri-operative fall in serum albumin levels and the outcomes in children undergoing emergent abdominal surgeries. Materials and methods This prospective study included all children aged 2-15 years undergoing emergent abdominal surgeries between January 2019 to June 2020 at our center. Preoperative serum albumin level (A1) was recorded for all children. Postoperative day 0 serum albumin level (A2) was sent 4-6 hours following the surgery. The degree of peri-operative fall in serum albumin level (∆A) was calculated by subtracting A2 from A1. Patients were then grouped on the basis of ∆ A, i.e. groups 1 and 2 with ∆ A < 0.5 and ≥ 0.5 gm/dl respectively. Additional data like diagnosis, surgical procedure, duration of surgery, complications, and length of hospital stay were also recorded. Recorded parameters in group 1 were then compared to group 2 statistically. Results Fifty-six children (male to female ratio {M:F} = 1.5:1), who met the inclusion criteria during the study period, were included in the study. Groups 1 and 2 comprised 38 and 18 children respectively. The postoperative serum albumin levels were significantly lower in group 2 (p = 0.0005). Duration of surgery was significantly higher in group 2 (p = 0.0474). Complications and length of hospital stay were significantly higher in group 2 (p = 0.0107 and p = 0.0375 respectively). Conclusion The present study evaluated the fall in peri-operative serum albumin level (∆A) in children undergoing emergent abdominal surgery as a marker of stress. Higher values of ∆A (≥ 0.5 gm/dl) depicted a significant correlation with complications requiring re-laparotomy and a longer length of hospital stay."

    "abstract": "Acute non-traumatic digestive surgical emergencies are a frequent cause of emergency in Africa. We undertook this study to investigate the morbidity and mortality of these patients in Cameroon, a developing country in Central Africa. This was an analytical cross-sectional study with prospective data collection, over a period of eight months (November 2019 to July 2020), at the Yaoundé central hospital (Cameroon). The latter is a second category (intermediate) public health facility in the Cameroon health pyramid, mainly welcoming patients without health insurance. All patients operated on for an acute non-traumatic digestive abdomen were included. The patients were followed up until the 12th postoperative week. We used Cox univariate regression to determine factors associated with the occurrence of postoperative complications. The significance threshold retained was 0.05. We collected 120 patients, representing 14.6% of all surgical emergencies. The mean age of the patients was 37.6 ± 13.5 years. Eighty (66.7%) were male with a sex ratio of 2. The two main preoperative diagnoses were acute generalized peritonitis (n = 58 or 48.3%) and intestinal obstruction (n = 38 or 31.7%). The two main etiologies were peptic ulcer perforation (n = 35) and acute appendicitis (n = 24). The delay between the onset of symptoms and consultation was 1.9 day and an average of 36.8 hours elapsed between diagnosis and surgery. During postoperative time the morbidity and mortality rates were 33.3 and 10%, respectively. Postoperative complications were mostly minor according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, with 21 cases of grade I (33.8%) and 12 cases of grade II (19.3%). The main cause of death was sepsis (8 out of 12 cases). We identified seven factors significantly associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications among whom three were modifiable: The consultation delay greater than 72h (p = 0.02), the time between diagnosis and the surgical intervention greater than 48h (p = 0.01) and the operating time greater than 2h (p = 0.05). In our context, the results of the surgical management of acute non-traumatic abdomens of digestive origin are marked by high morbidity and mortality. The possible solutions are: the organization of public awareness campaigns to prompt rapid consultation in the event of acute abdominal pain, the establishment of universal health coverage as well as the improvement of technical platforms. Les abdomens aigus chirurgicaux non traumatiques d'origine digestive demeurent un motif fréquent d'admission aux urgences en Afrique. Nous avons entrepris ce travail dans le but d’étudier la morbi-mortalité postopératoire de ces patients au Cameroun, un pays d'Afrique centrale en voie de développement. Il s'agissait d'une étude transversale analytique avec recueil prospectif de données, sur une période de huit mois (novembre 2019 à juillet 2020), à l'hôpital central de Yaoundé (Cameroun). Il s'agit d'une structure sanitaire publique de deuxième catégorie (intermédiaire) dans la pyramide sanitaire du Cameroun, accueillant majoritairement des patients sans assurance maladie. Ont été inclus, tous les patients opérés pour un abdomen aigu chirurgical digestif non traumatique. Le suivi des patients se faisait jusqu’à la 12e semaine postopératoire. La régression univariée de Cox a été utilisée pour déterminer les facteurs associés à la survenue de complications postopératoires. Le seuil de significativité retenu était 0,05. Nous avons colligé 120 patients, représentant 14,6 % de toutes les urgences chirurgicales. L’âge moyen des patients était de 37,6 ± 13,5 ans. Quatre-vingts (66,7 %) étaient de sexe masculin, soit un sex-ratio de 2. Les deux principaux diagnostics préopératoires étaient la péritonite aiguë généralisée (n = 58 soit 48,3 %) et l'occlusion intestinale (n = 38 soit 31,7 %). Les deux principales étiologies des abdomens aigus étaient la perforation d'ulcère gastroduodénal (n = 35) et l'appendicite aiguë (n = 24). Le délai moyen de consultation était de 1,9 jours et en moyenne 36,8 heures s’écoulaient entre le diagnostic et l'intervention chirurgicale. En postopératoire les taux de morbidité et de mortalité étaient respectivement de 33,3 et 10 %. Les complications postopératoires étaient majoritairement mineures selon la classification de Clavien-Dindo soit 21 (33,8 %) de grade I et 12 (19,3 %) de grade II. La principale cause de mortalité était la septicémie (8 cas sur 12). Nous avons identifié sept facteurs statistiquement associés à un risque accru de survenue de complications en postopératoire dont trois modifiables: un délai de consultation supérieur à 72 heures (p = 0,02), un délai entre le diagnostic et l'intervention chirurgicale supérieur à 48 heures (p = 0,01) et une durée d'intervention supérieure à deux heures (p = 0,05). Dans notre contexte, les résultats de la prise en charge chirurgicale des abdomens aigus non traumatiques d'origine digestive sont marqués par une morbi-mortalité élevée. Les pistes de solution sont: l'organisation de campagnes de sensibilisation des populations à une consultation rapide en cas de douleurs abdominales aiguës, la mise sur pied d'une couverture sanitaire universelle ainsi que l'amélioration du plateau technique."

    "title": "[Management of testicular torsion by a general surgeon isolated in Africa].",
    "abstract": "The onset of sudden and intense scrotal pain exposes to several problems when it occurs in a young man in Africa. Among the possible etiologies, testicular torsion is the surgical emergency to rule out, because beyond 6 hours of evolution the functional prognosis of the testicle is concerned. The septic evolution towards a purulent melting, in case of exceeded torsion, is also possible. Of slightly lower incidence than in Western countries, lack of awareness of this pathology by local health actors, the precariousness or health isolation of certain populations in certain under-medicalized regions, contribute to diagnostic and therapeutic delays. This often leads to a pejorative development, loss of the testicle being directly correlated with the delay in treatment. Testicular torsion has thus been identified as one of the main causes of male infertility in Africa. However, clinical diagnosis and surgical treatment require few resources and remain accessible in an environment with low resources or in precarious conditions. Indeed, despite the contribution of ultrasound in certain situations, the clinical picture is at the center of the diagnosis and therapeutic decision making. At the slightest doubt, surgical exploration is necessary. The multi-tunic anatomy of the testicle facilitates its surgical fixation in the event of conservation, ideally by triangulation of single-strand non-absorbable thread. Simultaneous fixation of the contralateral testicle is currently the subject of debate in the literature. In Africa, the benefit/risk balance, taking into account in particular the difficulty of subsequent access to care, justifies, from our point of view, performing contralateral orchidopexy at the same time. Depending on the appearance of the testicle and, to a lesser extent, the duration of the evolution of the symptoms, orchidectomy may be necessary. This article describes the clinical picture of spermatic cord torsion and the orchidopexy technique. L’apparition d’une douleur scrotale brutale et intense pose plusieurs problèmes quand elle survient chez un homme jeune en Afrique. Parmi les étiologies possibles, la torsion testiculaire est l’urgence chirurgicale à écarter, car au-delà de 6 heures d’évolution le pronostic fonctionnel du testicule est engagé. L’évolution septique vers une fonte purulente, en cas de torsion dépassée, est aussi possible. D’incidence légèrement inférieure à celle des pays occidentaux, la méconnaissance de cette pathologie par les acteurs de santé de proximité, la précarité ou l’isolement sanitaire de certaines populations dans certaines régions sous-médicalisées, contribuent aux retards diagnostique et thérapeutique. Cela conduit souvent à une évolution péjorative, la perte du testicule étant directement corrélée au délai de prise en charge. La torsion testiculaire a ainsi été identifiée comme l’une des principales causes d’infertilité masculine en Afrique. Pourtant, le diagnostic clinique et le traitement chirurgical nécessitent peu de moyens et restent accessibles dans un milieu à faibles ressources ou en conditions précaires. Cet article reprend le tableau clinique de torsion du cordon spermatique et la technique d’orchidopexie."

She underwent a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis which revealed intussusception in the left hemiabdomen with no definite lead point measuring 5.6 cm in the craniocaudal dimension with pneumatosis and no evidence of bowel obstruction. There were no other significant laboratory abnormalities. Acute care surgery was consulted and suggested obtaining a CT enterography for further evaluation which showed spontaneous resolution of intussusception with no evidence of pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or intraperitoneal free air. She reports that following oral contrast intake, she \"felt movement and relaxation\" in her abdomen with substantial pain relief. Infectious workup was negative, and therapy was initiated with intravenous steroids. In conclusion, intussusception has been very rarely reported in patients with UC with the most common treatment being surgical resection. However, conservative management in the absence of bowel obstruction can be attempted."

    "title": "An indirect effect of COVID-19 pandemic: Increased pediatric perforated appendicitis rate due to delayed admission.",
    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common surgical emergency among children. The coronavirus pandemic affected the system of hospitals more than any other field, and great amount of people were concerned about visiting the hospitals for any reason. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the profile of appendicitis by emphasizing perforated and acute appendicitis in the pandemic period and to compare the rates with previous three years. Charts of the children who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy due to appendicitis between March 11-September 30 between 2017-2020 were retrospectively analyzed in terms of demographic data, duration of symptoms, duration between hospital admission and surgery, radiologic imaging and perioperative outcomes. This study includes 467 children who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy. There were 97 procedures in 2020, 111 in 2019, 146 in 2018 and 113 in 2017. Multiple comparison tests revealed that age did not show difference; but onset of symptoms in admission (p= 0.004), hospitalization time before surgery (p <0.001), total hospitalization time (p <0.001) showed statistically significant difference between years. Pairwise comparisons showed that these parameters were increased in 2020 compared to other years. Perforated appendicitis rate was significantly increased in 2020 when compared to previous years. Although there is no direct relation between appendicitis and COVID-19 infection in the current knowledge, perforated appendicitis was found to be increased in children during the COVID pandemic. Reason of the higher rate of perforated appendicitis may be multifactorial; however, the pandemic appears to have a role in increased morbidity in children with appendicitis indirectly due to delay of hospital admissions."

TDT can easily be overlooked during concomitant trauma due to other injuries, The damage to the testis appears to be not severe in dislocation and may be corrected by repositioning even if it is delayed. However, delayed intervention might be associated with pain and discomfort and may lead to abnormal sperm parameters and possible infertility. The urgency of surgical intervention increases whenever there is associated testicular torsion, rupture, or bilateral testicular TDT. We report two cases of unilateral traumatic testicular dislocation following motorcycle crashes with different presentations and approaches to treatment.

Preoperative diagnosis of SHAA is a challenge because of its rarity and atypical presentation. Imaging may be helpful for determining the correct diagnosis. Surgery represents the standard treatment of SHAA. A 25-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department with a one-day history of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed RLQ abdominal rebound tenderness with guarding. Laboratory tests reported high levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a SHAA with intraluminal appendicolith, fat infiltration and pelvic fluid collection in a patient with MM. The patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy: a retrocaecal subhepatic phlegmonous and perforated appendicitis was sectioned and removed with drainage of pelvic abscess. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. SHAA is characterized by anatomical variation of appendix and atypical presentation. Preoperative clinical diagnosis of SHAA is very difficult and imaging may be helpful for determining the correct diagnosis, as well as confirming MM or maldescent of the caecum. Laparoscopic appendectomy represents the correct treatment of SHAA. SHAA is a rare surgical emergency that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with RLQ abdominal pain. Preoperative diagnosis needs a high index of suspicion and is facilitated by imaging. Surgery represents the appropriate treatment of SHAA."

    "abstract": "Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State (HHS) is a known life-threatening complication of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). As the incidence of T2DM continues to grow, it is important to remember some of its lesser-known complications. HHS has been described in the literature to result in small vessel thrombosis, leading to coronary or cerebral arterial thrombosis, resulting in acute myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accidents. The underlying pathology of this relates to the prothrombotic and hyperviscous state caused by HHS. On our review of the literature, however, we are unable to find a consistent description or HHS complicated by large vessel thrombotic occlusion. The authors of this paper present a mini case series describing two cases of HHS which were complicated by life or limb-threatening large vessel occlusive arterial thrombosis. This is particularly unique as we have otherwise only been able to identify single case reports in the existing literature from other authors. The purpose of this case discussion is to highlight this rare complication of HHS and to encourage clinicians to remember that HHS is not just a physiological or biochemical derangement, can also lead to true surgical emergencies requiring immediate treatment."

Therefore it should be considered in every case of acute abdomen. A 60-year-old female presented with a generalized abdominal pain associated with vomiting evolving for 24 h. Physical examination found an irreducible and tender hernia in the umbilical region with abdominal guarding. Laboratory test results showed a biological inflammatory syndrome. The primary diagnosis of strangulated umbilical hernia was suspected and the patient underwent an emergency laparotomy. Intra-operative examination revealed mutiple jejunal diverticula, with a perforation in one diverticulum leading to generalized peritonitis. A bowel resection and peritoneal lavage were performed with good outcome. Jejunal diverticula is a challenging condition with various non-specific clinical presentations. Jejunal perforation is its most feared complication. Deceitful abdominal examination among elderly patients and lack of specific signs may lead to diagnostic delay responsible for high mortality rate and poor prognosis. Adjunctive imaging modalities may be needed to help establish a prompt diagnosis and dictate management strategy. Treatment of perforated jejunal diverticulum is based on limited bowel resection associated to primary anastomosis. Jejunal diverticulitis should be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis in every case of acute abdomen. High index of clinical suspicion and eventual further radiological examinations are required to avoid misdaignosis and save patients' lives."

This is typically precipitated by radiotherapy, direct tumour invasion, or a combination of these factors. We describe a rare case of three consecutive carotid artery blowouts in a head and neck cancer patient. A 58-year-old man with a history of T3NO hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with chemotherapy and radiation presented with a four-month history of progressive dysphagia and right sided neck pain. Flexible nasendoscopy revealed laryngeal oedema and slough. A panendoscopy and biopsy showed no evidence of tumour recurrence. The patient was discharged and represented with worsening dyspnoea. He subsequently experienced a large volume hemorrhage necessitating ligation of his right external carotid artery. He underwent pharyngolaryngectomy indicated due to the extent of laryngeal radiation necrosis. Thereafter he suffered two additional acute carotid bleeds from his right common carotid necessitating ligation in theatre. This case report illustrates the key issues to be considered in patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and subsequent management of acute carotid blowout syndrome, which without prompt management, can be fatal."

It was predicted that patients who require urgent surgical procedures may not be able to access appropriate treatment during this period and may suffer from this process. In this process, we planned to report the effects of the pandemic process to this patient group by evaluating patients with acute appendicitis, which is the most common cause of acute abdomen among general surgery emergencies. In our study, we compared the patients who applied to the Training and Research Hospital we collaborated, whose clinics were compatible with acute appendicitis, between March 11, 2020, and May 21, 2020, with those applied within the same time period with the year before. We evaluated clinical and pathological findings of the patients and the treatment applied. In this study, there were 103 patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis before pandemic and 61 in pandemic period. We found that during the pandemic period, patients with acute appendicitis were admitted to the hospital less often, and in a later period, and more complicated clinical pictures were determined. Complicated appendicitis patients were higher in pandemic period compared with previous year (33.96% vs. 8.00% of patients, respectively; p<0.05). We emphasized that diseases that need to be treated urgently should not be left behind during the pandemic. Furthermore, we shared our clinical practice to ensure early discharge of patients with acute appendicitis during the pandemic process."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the leading causes of acute abdominal pain and surgical emergency. Stump appendicitis is a known complication of appendectomy whereby a retained appendiceal tip serves as a nidus for recurrent bouts of inflammation. Nevertheless, full-blown appendicitis of the vermiform appendix after a prior appendectomy remains a diagnostic conundrum. A 45-year-old woman presented with a six-month history of right iliac fossa pain. Pertinently, she had undergone a prior open appendectomy twelve years ago. Further investigative workup revealed full-blown appendicitis, which was not attributable to a retained appendiceal stump. A subsequent laparoscopic appendectomy was performed, and the resultant specimen was sent for further evaluation, confirming the diagnosis of recurrent appendicitis. Acute appendicitis is one of the most common life-threatening abdominal surgical emergencies worldwide, with 300000 appendectomies performed annually in the United States alone. Stump and chronic appendicitis are two separate and exceedingly rare clinical entities that may present simultaneously and develop serious complications unless promptly recognized and appropriately managed. The present paper prompts the clinicians to distinguish amongst the two at the initial surgery in order to thwart further exacerbations. While stump appendicitis is a rare but well-characterized complication of a prior appendectomy, full-blown appendicitis of vermiform appendix remains elusive. It is therefore imperative to distinguish between a duplicated and a recurrent appendix at the initial operative procedure to facilitate optimal patient management."

Less frequently, hernias through the broad ligament of the uterus can occur and account for only 4-7% of total internal hernia cases. We report a case of a small bowel hernia through broad ligament of the uterus in a young female. Multiple diagnostic modalities suggested a ruptured ovarian cyst as the most probable cause for her abdominal pain. However, her symptoms were much more severe than an ovarian cyst would normally produce. Therefore, a diagnostic laparotomy was performed, which found a small intestine hernia through the left broad ligament of the uterus. The diagnosis of intestinal hernias, specifically through the broad ligament, is often delayed due to the infrequent occurrence, varied presentation, and difficulty of confirmation on computed tomography (CT) scan. Surgery is the gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of internal hernias. This article draws attention toward a rare and potentially life-threatening cause of abdominal pain."

Many endoscopic methods have been used to treat acute perforated peptic ulcer such as over the scope clips, standard endoscopic clips, endoscopic sewing and metallic stents. The main idea in endoscopic management of acute perforated peptic ulcer is early decontamination and decrease sepsis by interventional radiologic drainage. This is a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. This study included patients who were developed acute perforated peptic ulcer manifestations and were admitted to our hospital between December 2019 and August 2021. Sample size was 100 patients divided into 2 equal groups. Endoscopic group (EG): included 50 patients who were subjected to endoscopic management. Surgical group (SG): included 50 patients who were subjected to surgical management. One hundred patients were randomized into 2 groups: SG (50) and EG (50). Median age of patients was 36 (range 27:54) and 47 (range 41:50) years-old in SG and EG, respectively. Males constituted 72% and 66% in SG and EG, respectively. Median length of postoperative hospital stay was 1 (range: 1-2) days in EG, while in SG was 7 (range 6-8) days. Postoperative complications in SG patients were 58% in form of fever, pneumonia, leak, abdominal abscess, renal failure and incisional hernia (11%, 5%, 5%, 3%, 2% and 3%, respectively). Postoperative complications in EG patients were 24% in form of fever, pneumonia, leak, abdominal abscess, renal failure and incisional hernia (10%, 0%, 2%, 0%, 0% and 0%, respectively). Combined endoscopic and interventional radiological drainage can effectively manage acute perforated peptic ulcer without the need for general anesthesia, with short operative time, in high risk surgical patients with low incidence of morbidity & mortality."

Toll-like receptors and their common adapter myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) can activate immune responses by recognizing a foreign microbe's product. This study aimed to identify the different time expression of TLR four signaling pathway in an experimental rodent model of polymicrobial sepsis. A randomized animal study was investigated in rats with septic peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The expressions of MyD88-dependent pathway biomarkers, including MyD88, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were analyzed and compared to the sham controls at the different time points after CLP surgery. CLP-induced sepsis increased liver MyD88 mRNA expression and protein expression compared to the control groups at 2 h after surgery. The MyD88 mRNA and protein expressions in rats with CLP-induced sepsis marked increased at 4 and 6 h, and their NF-κB activities and serum TNF-α levels also increased at 4 h after CLP surgery (both p < .05). The different serial expression of MyD88-ependent pathway during sepsis may be used as biomarkers during sepsis. These results may provide further helpful information for using pro-inflammatory biomarkers of innate immunity such as MyD88 and TNF-α in clinical sepsis or related abdominal surgical emergency in the future."

The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of the pandemic on the incidence, presentation, and management of AA. A retrospective analysis of patients with AA who presented to two academic medical centers during the NYC COVID peak (March 22nd-May 31st, 2020) was performed. This group was compared to a control cohort presenting during the same period in 2019. Primary outcomes included the incidence of AA, complicated disease, and management. Secondary outcomes included duration of symptoms, hospital length of stay, and complication rates. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. A 49.1% reduction in the incidence of AA was seen between 2019 (n = 114) and 2020 (n = 58). Median duration of symptoms doubled from 1 day in 2019 to 2 days in 2020 (P < .02). Proportionally, the incidence of complicated appendicitis rose from 19.3% to 41.4% (P < .005). 32.4% of patients with uncomplicated AA underwent non-operative management in 2020, compared to 12% in 2019 (P < .02). Hospital length of stay and complication rates were similar between years. Significantly fewer AA patients presented during the initial phase of the pandemic. Patients presented later, which may have contributed to a higher proportion of complicated disease. Surgeons were also more likely to treat uncomplicated AA nonoperatively than they were prior. Further research is needed to understand the long-term consequences of these changes."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 8.6% for males and 6.7% for females. Despite the frequency of presentation, considerable variation in clinical practice exists. Our study aimed to explore temporal trends in the investigation, treatment and outcomes for patients with appendicitis between 2002 and 2016. Data collected included all patients aged ≥16 years across the NHS trusts in Northern England between 01/01/2002 and 31/12/2016 diagnosed with appendicitis. Patient demographics, co-morbidity and management strategies were included. Outcomes of interest were length of stay and inpatient mortality. Over a 15 years period, 22,137 patients were admitted with acute appendicitis. A consistent male preponderance (n = 11,952, 54%) was observed, and median age increased over time (2002-2006: 36.4 vs. 2012-2016: 39.5, p < 0.001). Comorbidity of patients also increased (p < 0.001) in recent years. Computed tomography (CT) use increased from 0.8 to 21.9% (p < 0.001) over the study period. Following CT scanning, there was a longer time to theatre (1.22 vs. 0.70 days, p < 0.001), and patients were more frequently managed non-operatively (23.8% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.001). The utilisation of laparoscopic approaches significantly increased from 4.1 to 70.4% (p < 0.001). Laparoscopic patients had a shorter median length of stay (2.97 days) when compared with open surgery (4.44 days) or non-operative (6.19 days) patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 0.33% overall and decreased with time (p = 0.004). CT and laparoscopic surgery are increasingly utilised in the management of appendicitis.

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcer is a common surgical emergency condition worldwide, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if early diagnosis and immediate surgical management were not carried out. Perforation occurs in roughly 5% of PUD patients during their lifetime; this study aimed to explore the wide range of clinical presentations, associated risk factors, complications, and surgical management of perforated peptic ulcer patients. A 5-year retrospective observational study on the clinical presentation and surgical management of perforated peptic ulcer is carried out in a tertiary hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, Department of General Surgery, from January 2017 to December 2021. We included all patients undergoing operations with an intraoperative confirmed diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer at the general surgery department. For operated patients, follow-up evaluation was performed in the outpatient department. Fifty-one patients underwent an emergency operation for perforated peptic ulcer during the study period. The sociodemographic distribution of patients was 45 (88.2%) males and 6 (11.8%) females, giving a male-to-female ratio of 7.5:1. The mean age of patients was 35.5 ± 16.8 years, and the peak frequency was in the third decade. The commonest presenting symptoms were sudden onset of severe epigastric pain in 42 (82.4%) patients. Patients who presented perforated peptic ulcer within 24 h of initiation of symptoms were free from complications. Age-group and delayed presentation > 48 h after onset of symptoms were linked to postoperative complications and were statistically significant (P 0.032 and P 0.005), respectively. Four patients died (mortality rate of 7.8%). Two patients were reoperated because of the failed primary repair, and 4 patients had > 5 cm intra-abdominal abscess image-guided percutaneous drainage, and the rest were given antibiotic therapy according to peritoneal fluid culture and sensitivity results. The most common microorganism isolated was E. coli 22% and Klebsiella 11%. Other rare microorganisms (pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp.) were identified. In half (51%) of the patients with peritoneal fluid culture, no microorganism growth was seen. The distribution of perforated peptic ulcer is common in the young age-group in the third decades of life. Delayed presentation of the disease is linked because most patients arrived from remote areas where proper facilities of health care and health education are not available and the patient might come to the hospital in an advanced stage of the disease. We suggest conducting further researches, health awareness related to complications over-the-counter drugs self-medication, and bad habit including smoking, and to improve health-seeking behaviors of society."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency and if complicated, manifesting as abscess, perforation, suppurative or gangrenous appendicitis, carries significant morbidity and mortality. Its early preoperative diagnosis can improve outcome in patients and reduce incidence of negative appendectomies. It, however, mandates identification of new diagnostic parameters for it. This retrospective study evaluates diagnostic accuracy of serum urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium for complicated appendicitis. Sixty patients with suspected appendicitis were grouped into complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis based on histological reports. Preoperative laboratory results for serum urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium levels were obtained from hospital records. Diagnostic strength of these markers was calculated as specificity, sensitivity and area under curve. ROC curve analysis was used for their diagnostic accuracy. The levels of serum urea, creatinine and K were not significantly different in uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. However, sodium was significantly higher in complicated appendicitis. ROC curve analysis showed AUC values for all the studied variables to be greater than 0.5. However, none of the markers had good capability to differentiate complicated appendicitis from uncomplicated appendicitis. Serum urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium levels have shown a tendency to be predictive of complicated appendicitis but a strong association could not have been established. Hence, further investigation is warranted."

The guidelines elaborate on the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of immunocompromised patients. In addition, based on evidence-based medicine, it provides guidance and suggestion on the management of specific acute abdominal infections in immunocompromised patients, common acute abdominal infections in transplanted patients, patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), as well as perioperative steroid management. An interpretation of the guideline was performed to accomplish a better understanding the current status and recommendations for the management of acute abdominal conditions in immunocompromised patients, and to make forward suggestions on its limitations."

    "abstract": "Compartment syndrome usually occurs after trauma, fracture, or compression injuries. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first reported case in the medical literature of a combined gluteal and posterior thigh compartment syndrome after an accidental fall without an associated fracture. A 65-year-old man attended the emergency department of the general hospital in a remote island complaining of a swollen painful thigh. He reported that 24 h previously he had an accidental slip and fall on his overstretching right leg. Physical examination revealed right posterior thigh edema, tenderness, paraesthesia, and firmness to palpation. Any attempt to flex the knee provoked pain of intensity 10/10. In addition, there was blue discoloration over the lower half of the gluteal region, non-compressible tense swelling, and pain of intensity 10/10 elicited with passive range of motion of the hip. Compartment syndrome was considered and consequently, fasciotomy of the gluteal and posterior thigh compartments was performed under spinal anesthesia. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency. In a remote island, it must be considered and treated early because any delayed diagnosis may lead to loss of an extremity, kidney failure, sepsis and even death."

    "abstract": "Vaginal evisceration is an extremely rare surgical emergency that can be described as the extrusion of abdominal viscera through a defect or a rupture of the vaginal wall. We reported the case of an acute abdomen due to small bowel evisceration secondary to vaginal vault dehiscence that required combined vaginal-abdominal approach. We discuss the case of a 72-year-old female who presented to the emergency department for a large prolapse with visible extrusion of the small bowel per vagina. The eviscerated bowel was resected by external vaginal approach due to excessive swelling of the loops which made it impossible to reduce them through the vagina defect. A midline laparotomy was undertaken for further assessment, and the vault defect was closed by transabdominal repair. From its first description in 1864, just a few cases of vaginal evisceration had been described in the medical literature; the most common organ to eviscerate is the distal ileum, although cases of omentum, colon, fallopian tube, and appendix evisceration have also been reported. We described a rare case of transvaginal evisceration of the small bowel in our emergency department; it is a rare surgical emergency that must be managed to prevent serious consequences, such as bowel ischemia and necrosis, sepsis, and death. We suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to prompt examination and management by gynecologists and general surgeons is recommended to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. With this paper the authors would like to share the surgical manage of this rare emergency with other surgeons all around the world."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency abdominal condition in clinical practice. Fecalith is one of the rare causative factors, especially phytobezoars. We report the case of a 66-year-old man admitted with \"abdominal pain with vomiting for 1 day.\" Enhanced CT of the abdomen suggested incomplete small bowel obstruction. The symptomatic treatment with fasting, fluid replacement, gastrointestinal decompression, and antibiotics was conducted after the patient was admitted to the hospital. After 2 days of treatment, the patient's abdominal pain was not significantly relieved, so a decision was made to perform laparoscopic examination surgery. During surgery, a columnar foreign body was found embedded in the lumen of the small intestine about 10 cm away from the ileocecal region. Combined with the patient's preoperative history of consuming a large number of persimmons, the primary diagnosis of small intestinal fecalith obstruction was considered. We performed an enterotomy to remove the foreign body, and the procedure was uneventful. On postoperative day 7, the patient was successfully discharged. When we encounter a patient with intestinal obstruction without a history of surgery in our clinical work, we should take a careful history, especially about the consumption of foods that can cause phytoliths. When a patient has consumed a large amount of food that can cause phytobezoars before the abdominal pain, we should diagnostically consider it as phytobezoars intestinal obstruction, which helps to reduce the incidence of misdiagnosis and allows the patient to receive treatment timely and effectively."

    "title": "An Update on Acute Mesenteric Ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is an uncommon yet highly lethal cause of acute abdomen in the emergency setting. Computed tomography (CT) imaging, in particular a biphasic protocol consisting of angiographic and venous phase scans, is widely used to corroborate non-specific clinical findings when suspicions of AMI are high. Techniques such as low kilovoltage peak scanning, dual energy acquisition, or a combined arterial/enteric phase can improve iodine conspicuity and evaluation of bowel enhancement. Biphasic CT with CT angiography is mandatory to directly assess for the 3 primary etiologies of AMI-arterial, venous, and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), and the CT angiographic findings may be the first visible in the disease. In addition, numerous non-vascular CT findings have also been reported. Bowel wall thickening, mesenteric stranding, and ascites are common but non-specific findings that correlate poorly with disease severity. Pneumatosis intestinalis and portomesenteric venous gas, while not pathognomonic for ischemia, are highly specific in cases of high clinical suspicion. Bowel wall hypoenhancement is an early and specific sign but requires a protocol optimizing iodine conspicuity to confidently identify. Finally, intraperitoneal free air and solid organ infarcts are also highly specific ancillary findings in AMI. AMI occurs as a complication in 10% of small bowel obstruction (SBO) patients, and understanding imaging findings of ischemia in the context of SBO is necessary to aid in treatment planning and reduce over- and under-diagnosis of strangulation. Familiarity with the imaging features of ischemia by radiologists is vital to establish an early diagnosis before irreversible necrosis occurs."

    "abstract": "The clinical presentation of congenital abnormalities in adult life is a rare condition since they usually make their appearance in early childhood. A combination of two different congenital deformities is even more infrequent, a fact that might complicate the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. This is a case report of an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum in a 16-year-old male with intestinal malrotation presented in an acute setting, and a review of the literature. The patient presented at the emergency department with an atypical abdominal pain located in the right abdomen and quite elevated inflammatory markers. Computed tomography revealed Meckel's diverticulitis in combination with intestinal malrotation, findings that were confirmed intraoperatively. A partial enterectomy with a side-to-side anastomosis was performed, and the patient was discharged uneventfully. Only a few cases of this combination have been reported in the literature till nowadays. This article indicates the importance of the computed tomography scan in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain since it might reveal rare clinical entities and determine the further therapeutic plan. Furthermore, it is a reminder that congenital abnormalities might make their clinical appearance not only in early childhood but also in adult life, pointing out the ability of the general surgeon to deal with such cases."

    "abstract": "Various manifestations of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported since the pandemic began. Some articles have reported acute pancreatitis in adult patients due to COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge this is the first report of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis in children associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 7-year-old girl with congenital immunodeficiency was referred to the intensive care (ICU) unit with acute respiratory distress syndrome. She required mechanical ventilation (MV) due to pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 (chest CT with lower lung ground-glass opacities). SARS-CoV-2 infection was laboratory confirmed. Following a 49-day stay in the ICU, due to the clinical and radiological signs of acute abdomen and to the rapid deterioration in the clinical status, an indication to proceed an urgent surgerical intervention was made. Intra-operatively an adhesiolysis with blunt dissection of the of gastrocolic ligament was performed, then followed by debridement of the necrotic pancreas (more than 1⁄2 of the pancreas was damaged). Continuous lavage and drainage were placed. During the post-operative period, patient required aggressive MV and insulin therapy for persistent hyperglycemia. The CT scans reported a necrosis of the pancreas and we observed amylase and lipase elevation in the peritoneal lavage sample. Despite active intensive therapy, the patient's condition did not improve and she died 38 days after laparotomy as a result of multi-organ failure. The mechanism for the development of acute haemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis in the COVID-19 positive patients is unclear; perhaps it is due to a direct cytopathic effect from the COVID-19 virus, or due to the ACE2 expression in pancreas."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation is a surgical emergency that is associated with a high mortality rate and requires special care. During the pandemic, there has been competition with COVID-19 patients for health resources, especially ICU bed availability. The primary aim of our study was to compare the incidence of gastrointestinal perforation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases registered before the pandemic. A retrospective, observational, single center, cohort study was conducted that included patients that underwent emergency surgery for gastrointestinal perforation in the periods during the pandemic (6 months) and before the pandemic (12 months). Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, duration of hospital and ICU stay, status at discharge, and perforation site were compared. The study included 67 subjects (33 in the pre-pandemic period and 34 in the pandemic period). There were no significant differences regarding sex, age, or comorbidity. The perforation rate per emergency intervention was 4-times higher during the pandemic. There was an increase in the number of patients that were foreigners (4 [11%]) and nonresidents (6, [17%]). ICU admissions decreased (6 [19%]) but ICU stay increased to 137 h. Hospital stay increased by 5 days and delay in care increased 4.5 h. The number of deaths was higher (from 5 [15.2%] to 10 [29.4%]). Four patients with perforations were positive for COVID-19, were admitted to the ICU, and died. During the COVID-19 pandemic there was an increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal perforations at our healthcare system area; symptoms were more advanced, and mortality was higher. La perforación gastrointestinal es una emergencia quirúrgica asociada a una alta mortalidad que precisa cuidados avanzados. Durante la pandemia ha competido con los pacientes de COVID-19 por los recursos sanitarios, especialmente por la disponibilidad de camas en UCI. El objetivo principal del estudio fue comparar la incidencia de perforación gastrointestinal durante la pandemia por COVID-19 con los casos registrados en prepandemia. Estudio retrospectivo observacional de cohortes unicéntrico, que incluyó a los pacientes intervenidos de urgencia por perforación gastrointestinal en periodos de pandemia (seis meses) y prepandemia (12 meses). Se compararon características sociodemográficas, comorbilidad, tiempos de ingreso hospitalario y en UCI, situación al alta y localización de la perforación. Se incluyeron a 67 sujetos (33 en prepandemia y 34 en pandemia). No hubo diferencias significativas con respecto al sexo, edad o comorbilidad. La razón de tasas de perforación por intervenciones urgentes fue cuatro veces mayor durante la pandemia. Aumentaron el número de extranjeros; 4 (11%) y no residentes; 6 (17%). Los ingresos en UCI disminuyeron (6 [19%]), aunque su estancia se prolongó 137 horas. La estancia hospitalaria aumentó 5 días y la demora en la atención 4.5 horas. Aumentaron las perforaciones de intestino grueso (3 [8%]). La mortalidad fue mayor; 10 (29.4%) frente a 5 (15.2%). Hubo cuatro pacientes perforados COVID-19 positivos, todos ellos fueron a UCI y fallecieron. Durante la pandemia por COVID-19 hubo un aumento de la incidencia de perforaciones gastrointestinales en nuestra área de atención, con cuadros más evolucionados y mayor mortalidad."

    "abstract": "Transvaginal evisceration of the small bowel is an extremely rare condition after hysterectomy, which requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent serious bowel morbidity and mortality. A 65-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain and a mass protruding through the vagina. The past surgical history was significant, with an abdominal hysterectomy for cervical cancer performed 11 weeks prior to presentation. Pelvic examination revealed prolapsed small-bowel loops (18-20 cm in length). Pelvic computed tomography scan confirmed the presence of transvaginal evisceration of the small bowel. Bowel reduction and urgent laparotomy were the selected treatment approaches for a detailed inspection and thorough washing of the intrα-abdominal cavity. A Foley catheter was inserted in the emergency room, with the subject in the lithotomy position. The prolapsed bowel loops spontaneously reduced without manual reduction, and the vault defect was repaired transvaginally. The patient experienced no postoperative complications and remained disease-free for 9months postoperatively. Transvaginal evisceration of the small bowel should be considered a surgical emergency. A multidisciplinary approach to prompt case management involving clinicians in gynecology, general surgery, and emergency medicine is vital for preventing serious consequences. Hysterectomy is the most frequently performed gynecological surgical procedure, and evisceration occurs most often after hysterectomy. Therefore, patients should be informed about this rare but possible hysterectomy complication."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has severely ravaged the world since the end of 2019. Although most cases range from mild to severe with primarily respiratory symptoms, there have been some unusual clinical presentations, one of which is described in this case report. A 30 year-old woman with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) in October 2020 with sudden onset of severe left upper and lower abdominal pain. Her initial triaged blood pressure was 70 mmHg systolic, associated with mild tachycardia. Her beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) was negative, and her initial hemoglobin was 9.3 g/dL. A bedside ultrasound (US) was immediately performed, which showed moderate free fluid in the pelvis as well as in the right and left upper quadrants of the abdomen. She was stabilized with a fluid bolus and later underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed an apparent grade III splenic laceration without active extravasation. The patient underwent a successful embolization procedure by interventional radiology (IR) and was discharged from the hospital 2 days later. The initial medical workup included a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test but included no other findings that could serve as a cause for her spleen to spontaneously rupture. The purpose of this case report is to illustrate and make other clinicians aware of unusual potential complications and clinical presentations of COVID-19. The condition of spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR) is an uncommon but an emergent differential diagnosis in an otherwise healthy person with potential drastic outcomes. A careful approach in the management and care of these patients is warranted. This is one of a handful of case reports on SSR secondary to COVID-19 to the best of our knowledge."

    "abstract": "Transvaginal intestinal evisceration is an extremely rare surgical emergency with potentially fatal consequences. Only a few more than 100 cases with this pathology have been described in the literature. Aetiology is also unclear and multifactoral. We report the case of an 80-year-old female who presented with sudden severe abdominal pain and spontaneous small bowel evisceration through the vagina along with associated high-grade uterine prolapse. The loops and their mesentery appeared edematous, thickened and dusky, but without apparent necrosis. An urgent laparotomy was performed with subsequent reduction of the prolapsed small bowel into the abdomen, hysterectomy, partial resection of the vagina and vaginal closure. Additional cholecystectomy was necessary because of the visible pathologic changes of the gallbladder. The postoperative period was uneventful. The unique feature of our case is that there was no trigger factor (trauma, constipation or a coughing episode that would increase the intra-abdominal pressure), provoking the vaginal rupture and intestinal evisceration through it in the context of pelvic floor weakness. Early detection and surgical management are crucial for preventing bowel ischemia and abdominal sepsis. If the eviscerated intestine is ischaemic and non-viable, this requires resection and anastomosis. The approach should be individualized and performed by a multidisciplinary team."

We report a case of Rapunzel's syndrome associated with trichotillomania in a 16-year-old girl who presented to our Haematology unit with complaints of fatigue, abdominal distention, and early satiety. Initial evaluation demonstrated anaemia, thrombocytosis, and a left hypochondrial mass suggestive of splenomegaly. However, ultrasound of the abdomen showed no hepatosplenomegaly and blood investigations were not suggestive of haematological malignancy. Not long after, the patient presented to the emergency department with suspected acute abdomen. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed intraluminal gastric and jejunal masses causing small bowel obstruction. Emergency laparotomy confirmed gastric and jejunal trichobezoars, and subsequent psychiatric evaluation confirmed trichotillomania. Clinicians should consider trichobezoar in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and a non-tender 'spleen-like' abdominal mass."

Acute appendicitis is the most common nonobstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy, with an incidence of 1 per 500-2000 pregnancies. Delayed diagnosis and reluctance to operate on a pregnant woman predispose to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The elective termination of pregnancy or interventions to prolong it in the presence of appendicitis is controversial. We present a case of a 38-year-old Caucasian woman, G2P0, admitted to the Obstetric Emergency Department at 13 4/7 weeks of gestation with a primary complaint of severe nausea and vomiting associated with progressive diffuse abdominal pain which had started 7 days before. After the difficulty of inherent differential diagnosis, she was diagnosed with generalized peritonitis due to acute perforated appendicitis. Prompt exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy and drainage of multiple abscesses were performed. Conservative obstetrical management was assumed, with subsequent periodic monitoring of the fetal focus. Due to abdominal compartment syndrome, the abdomen was left open for 4 days. After 7 days in the intensive care unit, recovery was favorable, pregnancy remained uneventful, and a healthy full-term baby was born 27 weeks later. This case represents a successful example of how the cooperation of the obstetrics and general surgery teams and the decision of conservative obstetrical management in the surgical environment contributed to optimizing maternal health, achieving the best obstetrical outcome."

Higher mortality has been reported with admissions over the weekend. The aim of this study is to compare the delays and outcomes of emergency laparotomies performed on weekdays (WD) and weekends (WE) at a high-volume, large district general hospital. Methods A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was performed for all patients who underwent general surgical emergency laparotomy between June and October 2021. Patient outcomes were compared between delayed and non-delayed surgeries as per the NCEPOD (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcomes and Death) classification. The primary outcome compared was the 30-day post-operative mortality and morbidity determined by the Clavein-Dindo class ≥2. Secondary outcomes included the time from booking to anaesthesia start time, i.e., time to theatre (TTT), delay in surgery, out-of-hours (OOH) surgery, and unplanned return to theatres. Results Of the 103 laparotomies included, 33% were performed over the weekend. The most common indication for emergency laparotomy was bowel obstruction (53.4 %), followed by perforation (28.2%). There was no significant difference in mortality, the TTT (p = 0.218), delay in surgery with respect to the NCEPOD category of intervention (p = 0.401), postoperative length of stay (p = 0.555), number of cases operated OOH as well as unplanned return to theatres. There was a significant difference in the morbidity of patients between the two groups (Clavein-Dindo class ≥2, p = 0.021). Conclusion With consistent consultant involvement, an equivalent standard of weekend emergency surgical service can be delivered."

Objectives for the study were to evaluate learners' confidence to 1) prioritize the care of a pregnant patient with hemoperitoneum and hemorrhagic shock, 2) demonstrate interdisciplinary collaboration with other specialties, 3) apply massive transfusion protocol (MTP) in the appropriate clinical setting, and 4) analyze critical decisions for evaluating pregnant females with severe abdominal pain. Obstetric, general surgery, and anesthesia residents, along with labor and delivery nurses participated in a simulated clinical scenario that focused on the management of a pregnant patient in hemorrhagic shock. The learners evaluated the educational session using a standard Return on Investment in Learning survey immediately following the session. A total of 23 residents and medical students gave feedback on the experience. The main learning objectives were met with increased confidence in the four learning objectives by 77.3-95.4% of responders. Overall, greater than 90% of participants felt the simulation was relevant to their training and realistic, with 100% responding that the course provided new, or clarified existing information for them.

In severe acute pancreatitis, mortality is up to 10%-30%. Pancreatic abscess increases the mortality to 40%, and infected pancreatitis carries 100% mortality without surgical drainage. Anti-coagulant, anti-inflammatory and anti-protease activities of low-molecular-weight heparin are involved in preventing pancreatic necrosis and curbing the adverse outcomes of acute pancreatitis. To determine the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on the outcome of moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis. Hospital based, single centre, randomized, single blind, phase 3 control trial. First 140 patients with moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis admitted in hospital in the given period who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were taken. 70 patients were placed in the control and the trial group each by simple randomization (closed envelope method). The control group received conventional treatment for pancreatitis & the trial group received 1mg/kg body weight Enoxaperin, subcutaneously, 12 hourly for seven days along with the conventional treatment. Progression of disease in Computed Tomography Severity Index and incidence of pancreatic necrosis were the main outcomes studied at the end of 7 days of treatment. 1386 acute abdomen cases were screened, of which 269 were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. 147 patients with acute pancreatitis met the selection criteria and 7 were dropouts. Recruitment started on April 9, 2021 and closed on December 5, 2021. Computed Tomography Severity Index progressed in 22(31.40%) patients in control group and 6(8.6%) patients in the trial group and 18(25.71%) in the control group and 4(5.71%) in the trial group showed the presence of necrosis. The differences are significant (P value is 0.001 in each). No adverse events were seen.

A retrospective study of the appendectomies conducted in three third-level institutions from 2015 to 2019 was carried out. Complications, causes, and number of re-interventions, time from one surgery to another, surgical technique used, operative findings at baseline appendectomy according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) classification, and hospital stay were collected. 3,698 appendicitis cases underwent surgery, 76.7% of which laparoscopically, with 37.2% being advanced (grades II-V of the AAST classification). Mean operating time was 50.4 minutes (49.8 ± 20.1 for laparoscopy vs. 49.9 ± 20.1 for open surgery, p > 0.05), and longer in patients requiring re-intervention (68.6 ± 27.2 vs. 49.1 ± 19.3, p < 0.001). 76 re-interventions (2.05%) were carried out. The causes included postoperative infection (n = 46), intestinal obstruction (n = 20), dehiscence (n = 4), and others (n = 6). Re-intervention risk was not impacted by the baseline approach used (open surgery or laparoscopy, OR: 1.044, 95% CI: 0.57-1.9), but it was by appendicitis progression (7.8% advanced vs. 0.7% incipient, OR: 12.52, 95% CI: 6.18-25.3). There was a tendency to use the same approach both at baseline appendectomy and re-intervention. This occurred in 72.2% of laparoscopic appendectomies, and in 67.7% of open appendectomies. The minimally invasive approach (50/76) was more frequent than the open one (27 laparoscopies and 23 ultrasound-guided drainages vs. 26 open surgeries) (p < 0.05). 55% of obstruction patients underwent re-intervention through open surgery (p > 0.05). Re-intervention rate was higher in advanced appendicitis cases. In this series, the minimally invasive approach (laparoscopic or ultrasound-guided drainage) was the technique of choice for re-interventions. La apendicitis aguda es la causa más frecuente de abdomen agudo en niños. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar las causas, abordaje y resultados de las complicaciones que requieren intervención quirúrgica después de la apendicectomía. Estudio retrospectivo de las apendicectomías realizadas en 3 centros de tercer nivel entre 2015-2019. Se recogieron las complicaciones, causas y número de reintervenciones, intervalo entre ambas cirugías, técnica empleada, hallazgos operatorios según la Clasificación de la American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) en la apendicectomía inicial y tiempo de ingreso. Se intervinieron 3.698 apendicitis, un 76,7% por vía laparoscópica, encontrando un 37,2% evolucionadas (grado II-V de la clasificación AAST). El tiempo medio quirúrgico fue de 50,4 minutos (laparoscopia 49,8 ± 20,1 vs. laparotomía 49,9 ± 20,1, p > 0,05), superior en aquellos pacientes que requirieron reintervención (68,6 ± 27,2 vs. 49,1 ± 19,3, p < 0,001). Se realizaron 76 reintervenciones (2,05%). Las causas fueron: infección postoperatoria (n = 46), obstrucción intestinal (n = 20), dehiscencia (n = 4) y otras (n = 6). El abordaje inicial no influyó en el riesgo de reintervención (laparotomía o laparoscopia, OR 1,044, IC 95% 0,57-1,9), pero sí el grado de evolución de la apendicitis (7,8% evolucionadas vs. 0,7% incipientes, OR 12,52, IC 95% 6,18-25,3). Hubo una tendencia a reintervenir por el mismo abordaje que la apendicectomía, esto ocurrió en un 72,2% de las apendicectomías laparoscópicas y en un 67,7% de las apendicectomías abiertas. El abordaje mínimamente invasivo (50/76) fue más frecuente que la laparotomía (27 laparoscopias y 23 drenajes ecoguiados frente a 26 laparotomías) (p < 0,05). El 55% de los pacientes obstruidos se reintervinieron por vía abierta (p > 0,05). El índice de reintervención fue superior en las apendicitis evolucionadas. En esta serie, el abordaje mínimamente invasivo (laparoscópico o drenaje ecoguiado) fue la técnica de elección en las reintervenciones."

It is important to distinguish between complicated and non-complicated appendicitis before surgery. This study aims to determine laboratory parameters that can be used to determine whether the disease is complicated or non-complicated in patients admitted to the emergency department with AA. Female and male patients admitted to the Emergency General Surgery Department between May 2019 and November 2020 and diagnosed with appendicitis were included in the study. Demographic data (age, gender, and protocol numbers), complete blood counts (Delta neutrophil index [DNI], hemoglobin, monocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, platelet, platelet distribution width, mean platelet volume, reticulocyte distribution width), biochemical parameters (amylase, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, albumin, calcium, and lactate dehydrogenase), and examination information were obtained from the hospital automation system and recorded via SPSS software. Parameters of patients were divided into two groups as complicated and non-complicated appendicitis groups were compared. White blood cell (WBC), monocyte, neutrophil, DNI, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin values were found to be statisti-cally significantly higher in the complicated appendicitis group compared to the non-complicated appendicitis group (p-values; <0.001, 0.003, <0.001, <0.001 and 0.008, respectively).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current trend in perianal abscesses management at our institution, and identify factors that predict subsequent fistula formation or abscess recurrence. All acute patients admitted to a major teaching hospital who required surgical drainage of a perianal abscess were analysed over a two-year period from January 2019 to December 2020. Patient demographics, clinical and laboratory findings were retrospectively reviewed. Proceduralist experience, operative management strategy and recurrence rates (fistula or abscess) were analysed. The mean age of patients was 43 years old, and 73% were male. Trainees performed 96% of the procedures. Re-presentation with a fistula or abscess recurrence requiring further surgery was 31%. Comorbidities of IBD, diabetes, or malignancy were present in one-third of patients and significantly increased the risk of recurrence (P = 0.01). Searching for a fistula tract was performed in 41% of cases but did not reduce recurrence (P = 0.9). Seton insertion occurred in 10%, and fistulotomy in 2%. Perianal abscess drainage at our institution is almost exclusively performed by trainees, the majority of which occurs after-hours. Patients who present with a fever, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus or malignancy are at an increased risk of recurrent abscess or a subsequent fistula after drainage, and input from an experienced surgeon may be of value when considering seton insertion or fistulotomy."

Although this occurrence is exceptionally rare, rapid diagnosis based on recognition of gastrointestinal manifestations, clinical examination, and ultrasound confirmation can expedite appropriate care and prevent delayed complications. Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction and acute abdomen in pediatric patients. Without prompt identification, the disease process can lead to necrosis, bowel perforation, shock, and, subsequently, multiorgan failure. Intussusception has previously been associated with viral upper respiratory infections, which can cause mesenteric lymphadenopathy as a lead point to allow the bowel to telescope upon itself. The mechanism of how COVID-19 can contribute to intussusception without respiratory symptoms remains unknown. Here, we present a case of pediatric intussusception associated with COVID-19."

Adult colocolic intussusception secondary to a tumoral process is a rare but serious clinical condition requiring immediate surgical intervention. We report a case of a 65-year-old male patient presenting with abdominal pain and distention, subsequently diagnosed with colocolic intussusception in the descending colon with closed-loop bowel obstruction with impending caecal perforation. An exophytic mass on the descending colon was discovered intra-operatively, prompting a subtotal colectomy with ileosigmoidal anastomosis and loop ileostomy with the suspicion of malignancy. The histopathological examination of the surgical specimen concluded a moderately-differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma with 40% mucinous component. Adult intestinal intussusception is a rare but serious condition differing greatly in etiology from its pediatric counterpart. Its preoperative diagnosis is challenging in adults, which appears to be due to its imprecise presenting signs and symptoms; thus, the condition can be mistaken for other causes of intestinal obstruction. Adenocarcinomas remain the most common cause of malignant tumors in the colon, which also makes them one of the causes for colocolic intussusception. Intussusception can appear as a surgical emergency even in the elderly, necessitating prompt surgical intervention to avoid intestinal ischemia and gangrene. Its diagnosis can be aided to a great degree by CT imaging."

Treatment is initiated; however, the recurrence of abdominal pain is observed. Physical examination of the child at the emergency department reveals abdominal guarding and visible, palpable, painful intestinal loops in the left iliac and hypogastric regions-this is referred to as an 'acute abdomen'. An X-ray shows single levels of air and fluid indicative of bowel obstruction. Ultrasound reveals distended, fluid-filled intestinal loops with diminished motility. The intestinal wall is swollen. Laboratory tests indicate increased inflammatory indices. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination of the abdominal cavity and lesser pelvis shows intestinal dilation. The loops were filled with liquid content and numerous collections of gas. The patient is qualified for a laparotomy. An intraoperative diagnosis of perforated gangrenous appendicitis with autoamputation was made. In addition, numerous interloop and pelvic abscesses, excessive adhesions, signs of small intestine micro-perforation, and diffuse peritonitis are found. The patient's condition and laboratory parameters significantly improve during the following days of hospitalization. Despite the implementation of multidirectional, specialized diagnostics in the case of acute abdomen, in everyday practice we still encounter situations where the final diagnosis is made intraoperatively only."

A 54-year-old male patient arrives at the surgical emergency department, with a report of an accident with the insertion of an object via the rectum, a gym dumbbell. Initially opted for transrectal object removal, but with difficulties due to its position. Retained rectal objects are a rare complaint in the emergency department, but with an increasingly important occurrence in recent years. Physical examination should include an assessment of the abdomen and digital rectal examination. Imaging tests are mandatory for diagnosis, with abdominal and pelvis radiography being the most requested. Although there is no consensus on the most appropriate removal technique, less invasive initial approaches are recommended, with transanal removal with a 60-75% success rate under local anesthesia. The follow-up after the procedure depends on several factors, and in general, the patient should be kept under observation and attention should be paid to significant changes in the evolution and alterations in the imaging tests. The clinical history in these cases can be confusing, due to the patient's fear of reporting the complaints. Radiography is the best initial test, and CT is reserved for cases of suspected complications. Whenever possible, perform the extraction rectally."

A modified Delphi consensus exercise of three rounds was undertaken with stakeholder groups (patients and clinicians). Items were rated on a 9-point Likert scale. Items exceeding 70% rating at 7-9 were passed to the consensus meeting. New item proposals were invited in round 1. Individualised feedback on prior voting compared to other participants was provided. An international consensus meeting was convened to ratify the final COS. In round 1, 56 items were rated by 118 respondents. A total of 18 items reached consensus, and respondents proposed an additional 10 items. Round 2 was completed by 90 respondents, and nine items achieved consensus. In round 3, 80 surveys were completed; one item achieved consensus, and five borderline items were identified. The final COS included 26 outcomes, mapped to the following domains: Interventions, need for stoma, septic complications, return of gut function, patient reported outcomes, and recurrence of obstruction, as well as mortality, failure to rescue, and time to resolution. This COS should be used in future studies in the treatment of adhesive SBO. Further studies to define a core measurement set are needed to identify the optimum tools to measure each outcome."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis continues to be a common surgical emergency in children, but its diagnosis remains challenging. Use of diagnostic imaging to confirm appendicitis has gained popularity in some countries because it is associated with lower negative appendicectomy rates. This study reports our centre's experience of adopting routine ultrasound for the investigation of suspected appendicitis in children. A single-centre retrospective cohort study was performed investigating all children aged 5-16 years admitted under surgeons with suspected appendicitis, in January-December 2019. Primary outcomes were the rate of ultrasound use, its accuracy in diagnosing/excluding appendicitis and negative appendicectomy rate. Other outcomes were treatment received, length of stay and complications. The majority of the 193 children with suspected appendicitis underwent a diagnostic ultrasound (87.5%). Ultrasound was highly sensitive (0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96) and specific (1.0, 95% CI 0.96-1.0) for appendicitis in this study. Negative appendicectomy rate was extremely low (1.4%). Laparoscopic appendicectomy was the preferred management (75/86), with one case started open and no conversions to open. A minority of cases of simple appendicitis (10/86) were treated primarily with antibiotics. Rates of complex appendicitis and postoperative complications were similar to other studies. Ultrasound can be highly sensitive and specific for appendicitis. Its routine use to confirm appendicitis prior to surgery is associated with a low negative appendicectomy rate. This is a major change in practice for a general surgical unit in the United Kingdom."

A floating elbow is very uncommon with an incidence of 3 to 13% of all supracondylar fractures. A concomitant supracondylar and Monteggia fracture is extremely rare with only six cases reported in the literature. We present the unusual case of an eight-year-old girl with a concomitant ipsilateral supracondylar humerus fracture and open Monteggia fracture. Physical examination showed a neurovascularly intact limb. Surgical management was carried out in the form of closed and open reduction, percutaneous pinning using Kirschner (K) wires and Titanium Elastic Nails (TENs), and wound washout and debridement of the open lesion. The patient developed pin site infection six weeks post operation and subsequently underwent surgery for removal of pins. She was later followed up with normal radiographic and physical examination findings. The complexity of these fractures can lead to debilitating complications if proper management is not initiated. It is imperative that neurovascular and motor function be assessed in great detail and early surgical fixation be carried out in order to prevent these complications. A paediatric floating elbow is a rare surgical emergency. Although no guidelines for the management of these fractures exist, we recommend surgical management in a step-by-step approach be used over conservative management. We also stress the importance of regular follow up to address any post operative complications that may arise such as the one in our case."

Patients were classified into complicated appendicitis and noncomplicated appendicitis according to operative findings and/or histopathology reports. A total of 129 patients were identified and included in this study. Complicated appendicitis was found more frequently in female patients and older patients. Hyponatremia was found significantly more frequently in patients with complicated appendicitis (p < 0.001) and also in patients with perforation than without perforation (p=0.047).

In a minority of cases, BL can present with CNS involvement, usually as a secondary site. Rarely, BL can arise primarily in the epidural space and present with back pain, or less commonly, acute myelopathy. This presentation is a surgical emergency and requires vigilant management. We describe a case of pediatric BL arising primarily within the epidural space and presenting with progressive difficulty walking in a 3-year-old boy. Progression to complete inability to walk, absent lower extremity deep tendon reflexes, and new urinary incontinence prompted MRI of the spine, which showed a lesion extending from T5 to T10 and wrapping around the anterior and posterior portions of the spine with evidence of spinal cord compression. The patient underwent decompressive laminectomies from T5 to T10 and partial debulking of the posterior portions of the tumor. Microscopic examination showed a prominent \"starry sky\" pattern with abundant mitotic figures. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of BL. The patient is 10 months post-op and continues to undergo chemotherapy with partial neurologic improvement. He was free of recurrence 10 months post-operative. This appears to be the youngest described patient presenting with acute myelopathy in primary paraspinal BL. Management should include surgical decompression of the spinal cord followed by one of the various described chemotherapeutic regimens.

It is most unusual for an uncomplicated inflamed sigmoid colon diverticulum to be found in the hernia sac when performing acute repair of an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Resection of the diverticulum and subsequent repair of the hernia with synthetic mesh is an attractive alternative. Acute diverticulitis should always be considered in patients with an acute abdomen, this includes those with a painful hernia. Emergency surgery should not be delayed, and local resection of the inflamed diverticulum may be an option if no perforation is apparent, and the surrounding colon is unaffected."

The aims of this study were to examine Australian mortality audit data on acute surgical patients who were transferred after presenting with a surgical emergency, and to identify modifiable predictors of transfer delay. Surgical admissions between 1 January 2001 and 18 August 2020 were retrospectively extracted from the Australian and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality database. Relevant factors and themes of interest were collated. Results were presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with statistical significance defined as P <0.05. After exclusion, a final 8270 cases were analysed. Non-modifiable predictors identified were female gender (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.05-1.70, P = 0.0184), comorbidities (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.40-161, P <0.0001) and major non-trauma non-vascular specialty (OR 1.54 to 7.77, depending on specialty, P < 0.05). Modifiable predictors were inadequate clinical assessment (OR 49.48, 95% CI 32.91-74.38, P <0.0001), poor communication (OR 6.62, 95% CI 3.70-11.85, P <0.0001) and multiple transfers (OR 6.30, OR 95% 4.31-9.21, P <0.0001).

In the view of the receiving surgeon or assessor, all transfer delays potentially contributed to patient deaths, and may have been preventable. Strategies directed at modifiable factors could minimize delays. Increased surgical services in non-metropolitan regions could reduce need for transfer.

This article mainly explores the role of CT imaging diagnosis in common acute abdominal diseases in general surgery. In this paper, the use of computer-aided CT scan imaging technology in pulmonary nodules was firstly investigated, and the image segmentation algorithms based on CT images were given, including the spatial domain fuzzy C-mean clustering separation algorithm and the spatial domain fuzzy clustering level set semiautomatic separation algorithm, then the treatment of acute abdomen under the concept of ERAS was explored, and the treatment of ERAS under CT images of the acute abdomen was analyzed and studied. The empirical research results show that the ERAS's concept is guided by the undergoing national nutritional support with the traditional perioperative management. Compared to 12.9% of complications in traditional CPM groups, the recall rate of complications after ERAS group was only 6.01%, the improvement was obvious and the results were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Postoperative hospitalization time was also 4.62 days from 7.93 days, thus controlling the clinical risks of perioperative periods, providing a benefit to patient life."

    "title": "Appendiceal knotting causing small bowel obstruction: A rare case report.",
    "abstract": "Appendicitis causing intestinal obstruction by forming a knot around a small bowel is uncommon. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging as the typical presentations of appendicitis are not usually seen. The diagnosis of appendicular knotting is usually an intraoperative surprise. A 34-year-old male patient (BMI-20.86 kg/m2) presented to the surgical emergency unit with colicky central abdominal pain of 2-days duration, which later involved the whole abdomen. In association with this, he had a history of frequent vomiting of ingested matter which later became bilious. The abdominal examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding and rigidity. On midline exploratory laparotomy, the inflamed appendix which was adherent to the distal part of the ileum was observed. The appendix and the encircled segment of the distal ileum were both gangrenous, and the patient underwent resection of the bowel segment in addition to appendectomy. Whenever an appendix wraps around an intestine or its tip adheres with small bowel, cecum, or posterior peritoneum forming a ring-like structure, and a segment of a bowel herniates through an opening can cause a closed-loop obstruction with or without strangulation. The management for ileo-appendicular knotting associated with gangrenous bowel could be appendectomy and resection of the bowel segment. Postoperatively, the patient had developed diarrhea caused by ileocecal resection, which later subsided by medication. Ileo-appendicular knotting is a rare cause of small intestinal obstruction, and it's challenging to diagnose during the preoperative period. As surgeons dealing with acute abdomen in routine clinical practice, knowledge of this unusual case is helpful for clinical suspicion and evidence-based management."

    "title": "Effect of Cerium Oxide on Kidney and Lung Tissue in Rats with Testicular Torsion/Detorsion.",
    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that results in testicular ischemia as a result of rotation of the spermatic cord around itself. Oxidative damage occurs in the testis and distant organs with the overproduction of free radicals and overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines by reperfusion after surgery. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of cerium oxide (CeO2), an antioxidant nanoparticle, on lung and kidney tissues in testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) in rats. After ethics committee approval, 24 rats were equally (randomly) divided into 4 groups. Left inguinoscrotal incision was performed in the control (C) group. In group CeO2, 0.5 mg/kg CeO2 was given intraperitoneally 30 minutes before inguinoscrotal incision. In group T/D, unilateral testicular T/D was achieved by performing an inguinoscrotal incision and rotating the left testis 720° clockwise, remaining ischemic for 120 minutes, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. In group CeO2-T/D, 0.5 mg/kg CeO2 was given intraperitoneally 30 minutes before testicular T/D. At the end of the experiment, lung and kidney tissues were removed for histopathological and biochemical examinations. Glomerular vacuolization (GV), tubular dilatation (TD), tubular cell degeneration and necrosis (TCDN), leukocyte infiltration (LI), and tubular cell spillage (TCS) in renal tissue were significantly different between groups (p = 0.012, p = 0.049, p < 0.003, p = 0.046, and p = 0.049, respectively). GV and TCDN were significantly decreased in group CeO2-T/D compared to group T/D (p = 0.042 and p = 0.029, respectively). Lung tissue neutrophil infiltration, alveolar thickening, and total lung injury score (TLIS) were significantly different between groups (p = 0.006, p = 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively). Neutrophil infiltration and TLIS were significantly decreased in group CeO2-T/D compared to group T/D (p = 0.013 and p = 0.033, respectively). Lung and kidney tissue oxidative stress parameters were significantly different between groups (p < 0.05). Renal tissue glutathione-s-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and paraoxonase (PON) activities were significantly higher, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly lower in group CeO2-T/D than in group T/D (p = 0.049, p = 0.012, p < 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). GST and PON activities were higher, and MDA levels were lower in group CeO2-T/D than in group T/D in the lung tissue (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p = 0.008, respectively). Discussion. In our study, cerium oxide was shown to reduce histopathological and oxidative damage in the lung and kidney tissue in a rat testis torsion/detorsion model."

    "abstract": "In this paper, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for the initial diagnosis and the management of acute abdomen is discussed. POCUS is supposed to be executed mainly by doctors other than ultrasound specialists anytime and anywhere such as in the emergency room or the intensive care unit. Although it seems rather difficult to cover the wide spectrum of organs as well as diseases causing acute abdominal pain, the author advocates a \"six approach\" for the diagnosis and triage of acute abdomen, which consists of scanning at eight points in less than 5 min. With this method, the attending doctor can diagnose most of the diseases frequently encountered in patients with acute abdomen, which can help patients avoid unnecessary examinations or admissions. However, users of POCUS should be aware of its limitations, especially when they are using pocket-sized ultrasound equipment. Therefore, users should be careful when ruling out a disease even when they cannot find any pathological findings, and consider the need for further examinations such as US done by specialists with high-end equipment or CT. Since there has been no standard curriculum in Japan for POCUS training that should deal with basic physics and techniques for US, normal abdominal anatomy, typical pathological US findings, and interventional US, the establishment of a learning program for doctors and training of experts as instructors of POCUS are needed."

    "title": "[Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities].",
    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities is a surgical emergency and a rapid diagnosis and immediate surgical treatment are essential for the outcome. The cause is an increase in the tissue pressure inside a muscle compartment enclosed by fasciae and the resulting disruption of microperfusion. This can have potentially disastrous consequences, such as loss of the extremity due to extensive tissue necrosis or a threat to life due to infectious complications. Although mostly triggered by trauma, a multitude of other causes can lead to the formation of a compartment syndrome, so that a basic knowledge of this condition is of great importance not only for trauma surgeons. This is particularly true because a timely treatment necessitates rapid diagnosis and evaluation of the indications. This article provides an overview of the underlying pathophysiology, the causes, the symptoms and the treatment of acute compartment syndrome. Das akute Kompartmentsyndrom der Extremitäten ist ein chirurgischer Notfall, dessen schnelle Diagnose und sofortige operative Therapie essenziell für das Outcome sind. Ursächlich ist ein Anstieg des Gewebedruckes innerhalb einer durch Faszien eingeschlossenen Muskelloge und eine daraus resultierende Mikroperfusionsstörung. Diese kann potenziell desaströse Folgen, wie den Verlust der Extremität durch großflächige Nekrosen oder eine vitale Bedrohung durch infektiöse Komplikationen, haben. Obwohl meist traumatisch bedingt, kann auch eine Vielzahl anderer Ursachen zur Entstehung eines Kompartmentsyndroms führen, sodass eine Grundkenntnis dieses Zustandsbildes nicht nur für Unfallchirurgen von großer Wichtigkeit ist. Dies gilt vor allem, weil eine zeitige Therapie eine schnelle Diagnose- und Indikationsstellung erfordert. Im folgenden Artikel wird ein Überblick über die zugrunde liegende Pathophysiologie, die Ursachen, die Symptome sowie die Therapie des akuten Kompartmentsyndroms dargestellt."

    "title": "Bowel Obstruction Caused by Broad Ligament Hernia Successfully Repaired by Laparoscopy in an Elderly Patient: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "The most common causes of small bowel obstruction (SBO) are adhesions, Crohn's disease, neoplasms, and hernias. Internal hernias are rare, and they occur when the small bowel herniates through a defect in the abdominal cavity. The occurrence of internal hernias due to a broad ligament defect is very rare and accounts for 4%-7% of cases of internal hernia. We present a case of a 71-year-old female who was previously healthy with no significant past medical or surgical history and who presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction. Imaging with X-ray and computed tomography (CT) confirmed the diagnosis, but not the etiology. A decision was made to perform a laparoscopy to manage the obstruction, which revealed a healthy small bowel loop that herniated through a defect in the right broad ligament. Acute abdominal pain due to intestinal obstruction is a relatively common surgical emergency. Internal hernias are the consequence of the herniation of a bowel loop, most commonly the small bowel, through a peritoneal or mesenteric defect into a compartment in the abdominal and pelvic cavity, and they have a high mortality rate than can be higher than 50%. CT imaging is very useful in the diagnosis of internal hernias, although it may not always reveal the etiology. To facilitate wider recognition, broad ligament hernia should be in the differential diagnosis of internal hernias evident in the pelvis on CT imaging. Early recognition of small bowel obstruction caused by broad ligament internal hernia allows for prompt surgical management and vastly facilitates postoperative recovery. Although most surgeons opt for a laparotomy approach to manage such cases, a laparoscopic approach is feasible."

Several mechanisms have been proposed by which blunt abdominal trauma results in acute appendicitis. In this review, we describe a young, otherwise healthy male, who developed epigastric abdominal pain after being struck in the abdomen while wrestling with his cousin of similar age.

    "abstract": "Enteric duplication is a congenital disease that occurs throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract. Although it may sometimes cause intestinal volvulus, a few reports have described cases of enteric duplication twisted on itself. We experienced a rare pediatric case of long-segment tubular ileal duplication showing torsion. Torsion of enteric duplication is extremely rare. We herein report a pediatric case showing unusual torsion of ileal duplication requiring emergency surgery. A 3-year-old boy presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic luminal structure with a blind end and fluid collection in the pelvic cavity. CT also showed no findings of ileus or intestinal dilatation except for a cystic luminal structure. The preoperative diagnosis was torsion of Meckel's diverticulum. The patient underwent emergent explorative diagnostic laparoscopy. As a result, a necrotic luminal structure and bloody ascites were recognized, and small-scale laparotomy was performed. Long-segment ileal duplication was recognized. The long-segment tubular ileal duplication shared the anti-mesenteric side of the intestinal wall along one-third of its length. The residual two-thirds of its length was free from the ileum and its blind end was twisted in a manner that looked similar to Meckel's diverticulum. Normal ileum and the duplication, including the twisted necrotic portion, were resected, and ileal anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. A pathological examination confirmed the definitive diagnosis of enteric duplication. We reported the unusual presentation of intestinal duplication mimicking torsion of Meckel's diverticulum. Enteric duplication shows various clinical symptoms and presentations. We must understand that the classification of digestive enteric duplication is diverse with a variety of associated clinical symptoms."

    "abstract": "Thorough physical examination is a must for proper diagnosis of medical diseases and to elucidate all physical findings. Abdominal pain is a very common presentation to Emergency Department, compromising 5%-10% of all visits, and around a quarter are discharged with no particular diagnosis. Pyocolpos is one of those presentations that requires a thorough physical examination, including that of the external genitalia. A 3-year-old girl presented with recurrent history of abdominal pain and a recent history of fever with acute abdomen picture-like presentation, with difficulty voiding over the past few days. She was previously assessed for recurrent abdominal pain, without any identifiable etiology. Upon inspection for indwelling catheter insertion, absence of the vaginal introitus was noted with a bulging mass and an imperforate hymen. Pyocolpos was diagnosed and drained following hymenotomy. Pyocolpos is a rare complication of hydrocolpos. Enlarged vagina causes extrinsic compression to nearby structures, such as the bladder trigone and ureters, causing hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and other sequel including acute kidney injury and urosepsis. An imperforate hymen must be considered in the differential for chronic and recurrent abdominal pain, and can be easily identified by a thorough physical examination, including that of the external genitalia, which is a must in today's every medical practice."

    "abstract": "Early management is crucial for acute intestinal blood flow disorders; however, no published study has identified criteria for the time limit for blood flow resumption. This study specifically examines the time factors for avoiding intestinal resection. The subjects of this retrospective cohort study were 125 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for a confirmed diagnosis of intestinal strangulation (n = 86), incarceration (n = 27), or volvulus (n = 12), between January 2015 and March 2021. Intestinal resection was performed when intestinal irreversible changes had occurred even after ischemia was relieved surgically. We analyzed the relationship between the time from computed tomography (CT) imaging to the start of surgery (C-S time) and intestinal resection using the Kaplan-Meier method and calculated the estimated intestinal rescue rate. Patient background factors affecting intestinal resection were also examined. The time limit for achieving 80% intestinal rescue rate was 200 min in C-S time, and when this exceeded 300 min, the intestinal rescue rate dropped to less than 50%. Multivariate analysis identified the APACHE II score as a significant influencing factor. A rapid transition from early diagnosis to early surgery is critical for patients with acute abdomen originating from intestinal blood flow disorders. The times from presentation at the hospital to surgery should be reduced further, especially for severe cases."

    "abstract": "Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a common, potentially blinding ocular pathology that is considered a surgical emergency. Macular involvement has been identified as a major negative prognostic indicator for visual recovery after RRD correction. It is not currently clear whether early intervention improves visual outcomes, and in practice, there are potential disadvantages to performing early surgery for fovea-involving RRD. Such disadvantages include inadequate assessment of coexisting comorbidities, increased rate of complications related to poorly trained staff or tired surgeons, and anesthetic risk. A single-center, retrospective, cohort study of patients who underwent repair of macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment at the University of Virginia was performed. Variables collected included patient demographics, ocular history, clinical characteristics, and post-operative complications. Patients were excluded if they had a history of congenital or acquired pathology with an effect on visual function, bilateral or repeat rhegmatogenous detachment, age less than 18 years, follow up duration less than 6 months, or if they were repaired using scleral buckle, pneumatic retinopexy, 25- or 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, or any combination of these techniques. A multivariate regression model was used to compare overall outcomes such as post-operative visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure, retina attachment status, and complications among patients of differing timing of surgical repair. These analyses were adjusted for clinical factors known or considered to be associated with worse prognosis in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. A total of 104 patients undergoing 23-gauge vitrectomy for repair of macula involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments were included in this study with mean follow up period 17.9 ± 14.1 months. Early surgical repair (< 48 h) was pursued in 26 patients, moderately delayed surgical repair (3-7 days), was performed in 29 patients and late surgical repair (> 7 days) in 49 patients. Our analysis showed no difference in post-operative visual acuity between patients with detachments undergoing early versus moderately delayed repair of RRD. However, mean visual acuity differed between patients undergoing early versus late repair at 3, 6, and 12 months. No significant difference was observed in post-operative complications between the three surgical timepoints including cataract formation, development of glaucoma and re-detachment rate. Use of 360 laser was found to be protective against re-detachment overall (OR 6.70 95% CI 1.93-23.2). These findings indicate that a moderate delay of 3-7 days from symptom onset for repair of macula-involving retinal detachment may be a safe approach as there are no differences in terms of visual acuity or post-operative complications compared to early repair within 48 h. Delaying surgery for > 7 days however is not recommended due to the loss of recovery of visual acuity observed in this study. Use of 360 laser may prevent risk of re-detachment after primary repair."

    "abstract": "Duodenal injuries are rare due to their preserved retroperitoneal location. They are mostly observed after deep penetration or high-impact blunt trauma. They are difficult to diagnose and treat. Our purpose was to report a case of duodenal injury after blunt trauma with the review of the literature. A 20-year male patient was brought to Emergency Department with abdominal pain after an accident, in which he was stuck between a reversing truck and a pole. Rigidity in all abdominal quadrants was detected. Free pelvic fluid was observed in computed tomography (CT). There was a grade II laceration at the fourth part of the duodenum. The laceration was primarily sutured, and a naso-jejunal tube was placed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day-8 with uneventful recovery. In suspicion of duodenal trauma, a meticulous anamnesis, careful physical examination, proper imaging technique at appropriate timing, and surgical exploration are important to reduce morbidity and mortality. Imaging findings of retroperitoneal organ injuries can be non-specific. We suggest that surgical exploration should be the first choice of treatment in cases with acute abdomen findings.

We retrospectively analyzed the imaging findings of plain abdominal radiography of patients with acute abdomen who received abdominal computed tomography (CT) within 24 hours at the emergency department of a medical center in northern Taiwan between October 2019 and February 2020. Final diagnosis was made by CT reports and clinical data. The relevance between the imaging findings and clinical diagnosis in the groups of SAR and EAR were compared. A total of 1009 cases with acute abdomen were included, of which 341 (33.8%) underwent EAR and 668 (66.2%) underwent SAR. Among them, 820 cases had final diagnosis confirmed by CT and clinical data. In comparison of the diagnostic relevance of SAR and EAR, there were no significant difference in the overall acute abdomen, but EAR showed a better diagnostic relevance in cases with bowel obstruction than SAR did (100% vs 87.2%, p < 0.05). No statistical difference in other abdominal diseases. There is no significant difference between SAR and EAR in evaluation of overall acute abdomen.

The aim of this study was to investigate the findings of multidetector-row computed tomography of gastrointestinal perforations and analyze the impact of any imaging signs on the presurgical identification of the perforation site. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed emergency MDCT findings of 93 patients submitted to surgery for gastrointestinal perforation at two different institutions. Two radiologists separately reviewed the emergency MDCT examinations performed on each patient, before and after knowing the surgical diagnosis of the perforation site. A list of findings was considered. Positive predictive values were estimated for each finding with respect to each perforation site, and correspondence analysis (CA) was used to investigate the relationship between the findings and each of the perforation types. Results: We did not find inframesocolic free air in sigmoid colorectal perforations, and in rare cases, only supramesocolic free fluid in gastroduodenal perforations was found. A high PPV of perivisceral fat stranding due to colonic perforation and general distension of upstream loops and collapse of downstream loops were evident in most patients. Conclusions: Our data could offer additional information on the perforation site in the case of doubtful findings to support surgeons, especially in planning a laparoscopic approach."

    "abstract": "Paediatric orbital fractures are rare. Existing literature demonstrates wide variation in estimates of incidence, aetiology, management protocols and outcomes. Despite this, it is generally acknowledged that orbital fractures with entrapment of the extraocular muscles constitute a surgical emergency due to the potential for persistent diplopia secondary to muscle ischaemia and necrosis. This retrospective study was conducted to determine the characteristics and outcomes of management of orbital fractures amongst the paediatric population. It involved patients presenting to a major trauma unit in London between 2010 and 2020. Thirteen patients with isolated orbital fractures presented to our unit in this period. The average age was 13 years. Surprisingly the predominant aetiology was interpersonal violence. The most common fracture pattern involved the orbital floor and medial wall. One medial wall fracture case was missed in the emergency department. Eight patients required surgical intervention due to diplopia caused by muscular entrapment of extraocular muscles; the final patient had a large defect resulting in enophthalmos requiring a large titanium plate. A transconjuctival approach was preferred for surgical access and resorbable sheet was used in the remaining cases. Five patients had nausea, vomiting or bradycardia associated with the oculocardiac reflex. Surgical intervention occurred within 24-48 h of injury in 6 cases. Resolution of diplopia occurred in 7 patients within 6 months. Paediatric patients with orbital fractures should be assessed on the day of injury by a maxillofacial surgeon. Due to the risk of persistent diplopia, urgent surgical intervention in patients with entrapment of extraocular muscles should occur as soon as possible."

In this study, we aimed to find important indicators for risk assessment and predicting MDRB infections in the hospital. Using real-world data and machine learning models, we conducted a retrospective study from 2010 to 2020 in a teaching hospital to analyse the trends and characteristics of MDRB infections. Combining 39 hospital indicators, we used a random forest model and cross-correlation analysis to explore the important factors affecting MDRB and their predictive power. We built a decision tree model to predict the number of hospitalised patients with MDRB infection. The number of hospitalised rescues and rate of rational perioperative antibacterial drug use in type I and II incision operations were correlated with the number of patients with MDRB infection after 1-2 months. The number of hospitalised operations and rate of antibiotics use in emergency patients had an effect on current MDRB-susceptible patients. The indicators, including hospital operation volume and antibacterial drug use, had a positive or negative quantitative relationship with the number of patients with MDRB infection, and their thresholds could be fit to the MDRB prediction model. Surgical, emergency, and hospitalised rescue patients showed the highest risk of MDRB infection. Standardised indicators such as clinical pathway rate and rational antibiotic use rate could be used to control the development and spread of MDRB infections in the hospital."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis, a common abdominal surgical emergency, can mostly be diagnosed clinically by assessing the symptoms and physical findings but confirmation of the diagnosis solely depends upon the histopathological study of the resected appendix specimen, being supplemented by a few laboratory tests and ultrasonography (USG). In spite of all these available investigations, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, because of its nebulous presentation and the variability of signs, remains a Herculean task for the surgeon. This is a prospective study conducted on 125 patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis and posted for appendicectomy. Total serum bilirubin (TSB), and total leucocyte count (TLC) were done in all cases. USG of the abdomen was done in all the cases to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other causes of acute abdomen. TLC more than 11 x 103 cells/µL and TSB more than 1.1 mg/dL were considered positive. They were operated on and their diagnoses were confirmed post-operatively by histopathological examination. Patients were subdivided according to histopathological findings into: normal appendix (n = 11), uncomplicated acute appendicitis (n = 86), gangrenous appendicitis (n = 10) and perforated appendix (n = 18). Laboratory results, operative findings, and histopathological findings were compiled, analyzed, and compared with reference values. Out of 125 patients, 114 (91.2%) were histologically positive for acute appendicitis, while 11 (8.8%) had normal histology. TLC was elevated in 95 (76 %) patients and it was normal in 30 (24%) cases. Among the patients with leucocytosis, only 90 (94.74%) had positive histology for acute appendicitis, while the remaining five (5.26%) had normal histology. Among the 30 patients who had normal TLC, 24 had positive histology for acute appendicitis, while the remaining six had normal histology. The specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were 78.95%, 54.55%, 94.74%, and 20%respectively. Similarly, 67 patients (53.6%) had elevated TSB, while it was within normal limits in 58 (46.4%) patients. From the patients with hyperbilirubinemia, 65 (97.01%) had positive histology for acute appendicitis, while the remaining two (2.99%) had normal histology. Among 58 patients who had normal TSB, 49 had positive histology for acute appendicitis, while the rest nine had normal histology. The specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV are 57.02%, 81.82%, 97.01%, and 15.52% respectively. However, when both TLC and TSB were compared as markers of appendicular perforation, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of total serum bilirubin were found to be 89.29% against 21.43%; 53.49% vs. 2.33%; 38.46% vs. 6.67% and 93.88% vs. 8.33% of total leukocyte counts respectively. Elevated total serum bilirubin could be used as a better predictor of appendiceal perforation in acute appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Gall stone ileus is one of the rare complications of patients with cholelithiasis and usually affects elderly females. The usual sites for the stone to get impacted are the distal ileum and ileocaecal valve. Computed tomography (CT) remains diagnostic and surgery is the treatment of choice. A 60-year-old diabetic female, who was diagnosed with gall stone-induced pancreatitis one month ago, presented to the surgical emergency department with complaints of right upper abdominal pain with recurrent vomiting and constipation of five days duration. The patient was managed conservatively. A provisional diagnosis of subacute intestinal obstruction was kept and a barium meal follow-through (BMFT) was requested. However, BMFT was inconclusive. After two weeks, she presented again to the emergency department with clinical features of subacute intestinal obstruction. The patient was planned for exploratory laparotomy in view of recurrent episodes of obstruction and the presence of peritonism. Intraoperatively, we encountered a cholecystogastric fistula with a gall stone of size approximately 6.5x4 cm impacted at approximately 60 cm from the ileocaecal junction and dilated proximal small bowel loops. The surgical procedure comprised enterolithotomy and cholecystectomy along with repair of cholecystogastric fistula done. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Gall stone ileus is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction. Gall stone ileus presenting with a recent history of pancreatitis further makes the suspicion very unlikely."

    "abstract": "Peritonitis is one of the most important sources of abdominal sepsis. Since intra-abdominal infection leads to the activation of the inflammatory response, this suggested that some of these mediators could be used as markers of the severity of newly formed sepsis, but primarily to identify or rule out new-onset sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of serum markers of inflammation: C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and serum amyloid A in the serum of patients with diffuse secondary peritonitis. Methods: The prospective cohort study was conducted at the Clinic for Emergency Surgery of the Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade. The study group consisted of 100 patients aged 18 to 70 years, with signs of acute abdomen due to diffuse secondary peritonitis. Results: CRP and PCT are so far among the most valuable preoperative markers for distinguishing sepsis from SIRS. On the first postoperative day the analysis of the relationship between sensitivity and specificity at the different breakpoints used indicates a greater diagnostic accuracy and greater sensitivity of SAA compared to CRP and PCT. In the remaining postoperative period in our study, the ROC curve mostly coincided with the diagonal line, so CRP, PCT, and SAA had little diagnostic accuracy. The results of our study suggest that finding a specific marker for the diagnosis of abdominal sepsis, a marker that would differentiate between SIRS and sepsis, pre- and postoperatively, would be very useful."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is rare and characterized by rapid onset and spread of inflammation and necrosis. The infection starts within the fascia but can rapidly progress to include musculature, subcutaneous fat, and overlying skin. Its presentation is considered a surgical emergency. Persons who use intravenous or subcutaneous opioids are at higher risk of NSTIs. The purpose of this case report is to describe the positive clinical outcome after consulting with wound specialists and using a dressing regimen to expedite more rapid wound healing, shortened time to skin graft, and improved pain tolerance in a patient with a history of intravenous and subcutaneous heroin use. The patient presented with an NSTI that required extensive debridement of the bilateral upper extremities. The acute surgical wound service was consulted. A dressing regimen consisting of hypochlorous acid-preserved wound cleansing, followed by carboxymethylcellulose fiber with 1.2% ionic silver covered by hydrocellular foam to promote a moist healing environment, was used to facilitate granulation. Healthy granulation tissue was noted 6 days after debridement. The improved rate of granulation and the patient's tolerance to dressing changes secondary to decreased pain from these dressings significantly expedited the time to graft and wound healing. The patient underwent split-thickness skin grafting 10 days after debridement. There was 100% uptake of the grafts on postgraft day 8. The favorable clinical outcome suggests that early consultation with wound specialists and implementation of the dressing regimen were effective in this patient regarding improved pain control and healing. However, because the patient left against medical advice on hospital day 20, the clinical course could not be followed beyond the first few postoperative weeks."

    "abstract": "Campylobacter spp. are a frequent cause of gastroenteritis, presenting in some patients as an acute abdominal emergency. Here we describe the distinctive clinical characteristics of these patients. We designed a retrospective, single-centre, observational study. Children and adolescents under 18 years of age who had positive stool cultures for Campylobacter spp. during the period between June 1, 2008 and May 31, 2016 were identified from our database. Hospitalised patients with Campylobacter spp. were then matched for age and gender with patients hospitalised for gastroenteritis of other or unknown aetiology. Patients who had undergone abdominal radiographic investigation or had received a surgery consultation were included as \"acute abdomen\" (AA) cases. Demographics, clinical characteristics and management were compared between AA and non-AA cases. One hundred and forty-one patients with cultures positive for Campylobacter spp. were included in the analysis. Nineteen patients were identified as AA cases. Fewer of these had diarrhoea (14/19, 74% vs 117/121, 97%; p = 0.02) and more reported a lower sense of general wellbeing (8/18, 44% vs 8/108, 7%; p <0.001). Localised pain (9/18, 50% vs 20/115, 17%; p = 0.002) and abdominal tenderness (2/18, 11% vs 0/111; p = 0.02) were also more common among AA cases. Forty-four patients with Campylobacter spp. infections were hospitalised and matched with 44 patients with gastroenteritis of other or unknown aetiology. Campylobacter spp. infection (risk ratio 3.6, 95% CI 1.3-9.7; p = 0.01) was positively correlated with being seen by a surgeon and/or a prescription for radiological examination. We identified a subset of patients with Campylobacter spp. gastroenteritis who present as an acute abdominal emergency. The presentation of these patients was characterised mainly by the nature of the associated abdominal pain."

Acute indications for emergent pituitary surgery include pituitary apoplexy, vision loss, and severe Cushing presentation. Emergencies may also occur intraoperatively, secondary to bleeding. Postoperative emergencies include epistaxis, pneumocephalus, and intracranial bleeding. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurs in about 37.4% of transsphenoidal sellar surgery, yet postoperative CSF leaks are less frequent at approximately 2.6%. As they occur often during pituitary surgery, CSF leaks alone are generally not considered a true surgical emergency unless associated with symptomatic tension pneumocephalus."

There are some patients will not pass their stones and will ultimately require surgical intervention. Through retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 212 pregnant women with renal colic, the predictive factors of pregnant women with renal colic in need of surgical intervention were determined. We conducted a retrospective review of 212 pregnant women presenting with renal colic between 1st January 2009 and 31st December 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified a range of predictive variables for surgical intervention. In addition, we used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to evaluate the predictive power of our model and created a nomogram for clinical application. Of the 212 patients presenting with acute renal colic in pregnancy, 100 patients (47.2%) underwent surgical intervention and 112 patients (52.8%) were treated conservatively. Univariate analysis identified significant differences between the two groups with regards to fever, the duration of pain, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, ureteral stone size, hydronephrosis, and stone location. Multivariate analysis further identified a number of independent predictors for surgical intervention, including fever, a duration of pain ≥ 4 days, a ureteral stone size ≥ 8 mm, and moderate or severe hydronephrosis. We identified several independent predictors for surgical intervention for renal colic in pregnancy. Fever, a duration of pain ≥ 4 days, a ureteral stone size ≥ 8 mm, and moderate/severe hydronephrosis, play significant roles in predicting surgical intervention. Our nomogram can help to calculate the probability of surgical intervention in a simple and efficient manner. Prospective studies are now required to validate our model."

Our study determined that certain Doppler scrotal US findings, specifically, testicular and epididymal heterogeneity as well as a thickened scrotal wall, are associated with testicular demise in patients with testicular torsion. As testicular heterogeneity and scrotal wall thickening are more likely to arise with a longer symptom duration, an urgent diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are imperative to avert testicular loss."

    "title": "A Retrospective Analysis of Conservative Management Versus Early Surgical Intervention in Appendicular Lump.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Acute appendicitis happens to be increasingly common in school-going children and early part of adult life, peak incidence reaching in the teens and early twenties. Luminal obstruction of the vermiform appendix is thought to be essential for the development of appendicular ischemia, gangrene, and perforation. The treatment of choice in acute appendicitis is emergency appendectomy. Appendicitis particularly puts the surgeon in a dilemma whenever the patient presents late by around four to seven days. In case of delay in presentation, complications like appendicular lump formation occur. The factors that make the clinical presentation inconsistent which in turn makes the diagnosis challenging in the case of acute appendicitis are the variable position of the appendix, the degree/grade of inflammation, and the age of the patient. At present, the standard treatment is the Ochsner-Sherren regimen universalized by Oschner and has been mostly practised over many decades as the standard care for the appendicular lump. Conservative regimen does not work in a few cases where urgent surgical exploration is necessary. This study was conducted to compare early appendectomy versus conservative management followed by interval appendectomy in case of appendicular mass and to make a better strategy for effective management of patients with complicated appendicitis. Methods A total of 112 patients were diagnosed as having an appendicular lump as per the available records between June 2018 and June 2021. The total study population was divided into two comparative groups depending upon the treatment they received. The patients in group-1 received medical treatment and those in group-2 had undergone surgical management. The patients in group-1 were treated according to the Ochsner-Sherren regimen. The patients in group-2 were the patients in whom emergency appendectomy was done. If the general condition of the patient did not improve, pain and tenderness didn't subside, the size of phlegmon or abscess was increasing and other features of the acute abdomen were persistent, then it was regarded as a failure of medical treatment and the patient was prepared for surgery on an emergency basis. Results Out of 1192 cases of acute appendicitis admitted between June 2018 and June 2021, a total of 112 patients were diagnosed with an appendicular lump. As per the record, 64 patients were managed conventionally as per the Ochsner-Sherren regimen followed by elective interval appendectomy (group-1) and 48 cases were managed with an emergency surgical procedure (group-2). In group-1, out of 64 patients, non-operative treatment was successful in 58 patients (90.62%). Among the remaining patients, there was a failure of non-operative treatment in six patients and they were subjected to emergency surgical exploration (9.37%). So a total of 58 patients underwent interval appendectomy after six weeks. Out of 54 patients who had undergone emergency appendectomy in both groups, the per-operative finding was an appendicular lump in 55.5% of patients while a total of 44 patients in group-2, were discharged from the hospital within six days (91.66%). But in group-1, only 16 patients were discharged from the hospital within six days (25%), rest were discharged from the hospital after more than seven days of stay. Conclusion Early appendectomy in appendicular mass is safe due to the improvements in surgical techniques and better postoperative care."

In patients with peritonitis, the risk of incisional hernia (IH) is extremely elevated. The evaluation of quality of life of patients with incisional hernia showed lower mean scores on physical components of health-related quality of life and body image. Furthermore, the arise of a post-operative abdominal wall complication (i.e., wound dehiscence, evisceration and IH) greatly increases morbidity and mortality rates and prolongs the hospitalization. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the use of a swine dermal collagen prosthesis implanted preperitoneally as a prophylactic procedure in urgency/emergency setting against abdominal wall complications in patients operated with contaminated/infected field in peritonitis. The sample size was defined in 90 patients divided in two arms (prosthesis positioning versus normal wall abdominal closure). The follow-up will be performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The percentage of incisional hernias, wound infections, and adverse events will be investigated by physical examination and ultrasound.

    "abstract": "The treatment of acute cholecystitis is based on the German S3 guidelines on \"Prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of gallstones\", which was updated in 2018. If the patient has no contraindications for surgery, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice. Current meta-analyses and studies confirm that for most patients the optimal period of time for surgical treatment is the first 24 h after hospitalization; however, there is an ongoing controversial discussion on how strictly the 24 h rule should be adhered to and under which circumstances it may be valid to deviate from it. A systematic analysis of the current literature and a clinical evaluation were carried out. For the diagnosis of an acute cholecystitis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be carried out within the first 24 h after hospitalization regardless of the age and comorbidities of the patient as well as the severity of inflammation. If there is no special emergency situation, under certain circumstances surgery can be performed in the next day's program. This recommendation for early surgery for high-risk patients has so far been controversially discussed; however, current studies confirm that the advantages of early surgery outweigh the disadvantages also for this group of patients. The surgical risk should be individually assessed and be included in the treatment decision. HINTERGRUND: Die Behandlung der „akuten Cholezystitis“ basiert auf der 2018 aktualisierten S3-Leitlinie für „Prophylaxe, Diagnostik und Therapie des Gallensteinleidens“. Wenn eine Operationsfähigkeit des Patienten vorliegt, dann ist die frühzeitige laparoskopische Cholezystektomie die Therapie der Wahl. Aktuelle Metaanalysen und Studien belegen, dass die ersten 24 h nach stationärer Aufnahme für die meisten Patienten der optimale Behandlungszeitraum für eine Operation darstellt. Allerdings besteht eine kontroverse Diskussion darüber, wie strikt diese Regel einzuhalten ist und unter welchen Umständen es sinnvoll sein kann, davon abzuweichen. Es erfolgte eine systematische Analyse der aktuellen Literatur und eine klinische Bewertung. Bei der Diagnose einer „akuten Cholezystitis“ ist unabhängig von Alter und Vorerkrankungen der Patienten sowie unabhängig vom Schweregrad der Entzündung die laparoskopische Cholezystektomie innerhalb von 24 h nach Krankenhausaufnahme anzustreben. Besteht keine besondere Notfallsituation, kann der Eingriff unter Umständen auch im nächsten Tagesprogramm erfolgen. Die Empfehlung zur frühen Operation wurde bislang für Risikopatienten kontrovers diskutiert. Aktuelle Studien belegen jedoch, dass auch für dieses Patientengut die Vorteile einer frühzeitigen, operativen Therapie überwiegen. Das Operationsrisiko sollte dabei individuell bewertet werden und in die Therapieentscheidung mit einfließen."

We report a case of visceral disseminated VZV infection in a patient with well-controlled diabetes mellitus with fat stranding around the celiac and superior mesenteric artery on CT. A 61-year-old Japanese woman with well-controlled diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain that gradually worsened. She had stable vital signs and skin rashes, suggestive of varicella. Abdominal CT showed fat stranding around the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. The patient tested positive for the VZV antigen and was diagnosed with a visceral disseminated VZV infection. Acyclovir was administered, and the patient was discharged on the 14th day.

Complications encountered after composite graft replacement include distortion of the proximal part of the coronary artery, bleeding from the conduit implant site, and reattached coronary artery origins caused in general by a consumption coagulopathy. In cases for which aortic valve preservation is not applicable and the root is not dissected or dilated, surgeons often opt for less complicated techniques like aortic valve and supracoronary ascending aortic replacement. Nevertheless, these patients carry a high risk of late aortic root dilatation and subsequent reoperation. The goal of aortic root reinforcement by the Florida sleeve technique is to encase the aortic root to prevent any further dilatation and perioperative bleeding."

The US was performed first and divided into two steps, using B-mode US and both B-mode and contrast-specific software US, with no contrast media administration. All the patients underwent CT examination. In 32 out of 157 patients, the surgery confirmed GI perforation. CT correctly detected 31 out of 32 patients; the contrast-specific software US identified 30 perforated patients.

Due to its different manifestations and time course, adult colonic intussusception often poses a diagnostic challenge for emergency doctors. The treatment of colonic intussusception in adults typically involves surgery, often with bowel resection and anastomosis followed by a defunctioning loop ileostomy. We report a case of left-sided colocolic intussusception secondary to a tubular adenoma as the lead point, which was successfully treated by resection and primary anastomosis. The pathological diagnosis of the lesion was reported as adenocarcinoma and resected bowel margins were found free of the tumor."

Twenty percent of patients with acute abdominal pain will be diagnosed with bowel obstruction; eighty percent of them are of small origin. It is classified based on etiology to either mechanical or functional. Mechanical obstruction is a physical barrier that obstructs the passage of bowel content; it could be caused by adhesion, tumors, volvulus, hernias, strictures, and gallstone ileus. Functional obstruction is usually due to impaired peristalsis or metabolic disorders. In this article, we report a case of an 80-year-old gentleman with no previous surgical history who was found to have a bowel obstruction. Diagnostic imaging and colonoscopy showed that his clinical presentation was due to gallstone ileus with cholecysto-enteric fistula and sigmoid mass. He underwent exploratory laparotomy with small bowel resection and sigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis and diverting ileostomy.

The main circumstances of discovery were anuria (67%), oligoanuria (21.5%), low back pain (17%) and hematuria (9%). Clinical examination found an altered general condition (Performans Status> 2) in 37.5% of the patients and an advanced local state in 96% of the patients. The means of serum creatinine and blood urea were 122 mg/l and 2.4 g/l respectively. The hemodialysis (HD) was indicated in 29.5% of patients with life-threatening hyperkalemia (Kalemia> 6.4meq/l) with cardiac distress (20.5%), hydro-sodium overload (6%) and metabolic acidosis (3%). The ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrostomy was the main method of diversion (92%) followed by the placement of the double J stent (8%). The outcome was favorable in the majority of patients with normalization of the kidney function (88%) while 7% of cases kept chronic kidney disease. The main complication was an obstruction syndrome (41%), followed by infections of the percutaneous nephrostomy tubes (13%) and venous thrombosis of the lower limbs (3%). In addition, the mortality was estimated at 5%. The obstructive anuria constitutes a medico-surgical emergency involving the patient's vital prognosis. Our study notes the frequent association between the pelvic gynecological tumors and the obstructive anuria, which can be explained by the advanced stage of these tumors. This work underlines the fundamental interest of early diagnosis of these tumors to enable the prevention of the OA."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen during pregnancy is a major challenge for physicians, due to the altered anatomical conditions and the limited use of medical imaging. We present a pregnant woman with a rare form of abdominal bleeding. This case study is based on the patient's medical documentations and interviews with her physicians. A woman in the 33rd week of her pregnancy was admitted to our department with acute abdomen, trauma was ruled out. Due to the deteriorating cardiorespiratory status we performed an emergency caesarean section delivering a living premature newborn. A general surgeon was present, and 1500 ml of blood was evacuated from the abdomen. Active venous type bleeding was present from the splenic vessels, therefore we performed a splenectomy. The histopathological analysis of the whole organ complex showed that the media layer segmentally and progressively disappeared in the splenic hilar veins, giving rise to the high probability that the bleeding was caused by a diathesis-type leakage through the endothelium and to the weakened media layer in the absence of a luminal-type vessel rupture. Hemoperitoneum during pregnancy is an exceptionally rare condition, however its mortality rate is high both for the mother and the fetus. The bleeding usually originates from the pelvis. On rare occasions the bleeding occurs from the splenic vessels although most of them are arterial bleedings from an aneurysm.In our case the emergency laparotomy was essential for the correct diagnosis and the treatment, which resulted in saving and recovering both the mother and the fetus. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(8): 328-332. Az \"akut has\", mint kórkép, a várandósság során mind diagnosztikailag, mind terápiásan nagy kihívást jelent a szülész számára a megváltozott anatómiai viszonyok és a képalkotó eljárások korlátozott használhatósága miatt. Közleményünkben bemutatjuk egy harmadik trimeszterbeli gravida hasi vérömlenyének az esetét, melynek vérzésforrása irodalmi ritkaság, a vérzés típusát a felkereshető irodalomban még nem írták le terheseknél. Az esettanulmány megírása a páciens orvosi dokumentációi és az ellátásában résztvevő klinikusok, patológusok leletei és beszámolói alapján történt. A várandósságának 33. hetében járó gravida akut hasi tünetegyüttessel jelentkezett klinikánkon, anamnéziséből trauma kizárható volt. Az anya romló kardiorespiratorikus állapota miatt sürgősségi császármetszéssel élő, koraszülött magzatot segítettünk világra. A műtét során kb. 1500 ml vért találtunk a hasüregben, melynek okát általános sebész bevonásával kerestük. Aktív vérzésforrásként a lép ereinek területéről vénás jellegű szivárgó vérzést találtunk, ezért splenectomia mellett döntöttünk. Az eltávolított szervkomplexum teljes szövettani feldolgozása helyenként a kisebb léphilusi vénaágak izomfalának felrostozódását és fokozatos eltűnését igazolta, a patológus a vérzés okát a meggyengült érfal endothelen keresztüli vérszivárgásának véleményezte, definitív érfalszakadásra utaló elváltozás nem volt azonosítható. A haemoperitoneum várandósság alatt kifejezetten ritka kórkép, azonban mortalitása mind az anyára, mind a magzatra nézve rendkívül magas. Irodalmi adatok alapján a vérzésforrás leggyakrabban a kismedencei szervek területén jelentkezik. Ritkán a lépartéria aneurysmájának rupturája is előfordul terhességben, a lépvénás eredetű vérzés viszont irodalmi ritkaságnak számít, és az összes feldolgozott és közölt esetben az ér szakadásos sérülése volt a fő ok, az esetünkben leírt, ismeretlen etiológiájú, érfalvesztéses hemorrhágiát sehol nem említik. A várandósunk ellátásánál ellátásánál kulcsfontosságú volt a gyorsan elvégzett exploratív laparotomia, mely a kórkép okát felderítette és megszüntette, lehetővé téve az anya és gyermeke túlélését és felépülését. Esetünk rámutat arra, hogy a várandóssági hasűri vérömlenyek kóroktana akár irodalmi ritkaságokat is rejthet, azaz a pontos ok kiderítésével, lumenes vérzésforrás keresésével nem szabad szükségtelen időt veszteni az édesanya és gyermeke életmentő ellátásának rovására.

    "abstract": "Abdominal acute pain is a manifestation of heterogeneous medical conditions, with difficult clinical-laboratory assessment. Multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the gold standard imaging technique for evaluating adult patients with acute abdominal pain. Due to its fast execution and the high spatial resolution, CT is fundamental in the diagnostic and therapeutic work-up of patients with time-dependent pathology that could require surgical treatment, reducing mortality and morbidity. However, the radiological risk connected to the ionizing radiation use should not be underestimated, especially in young patients. The aim of this study is to identify optimized CT protocols to apply in the management of non-traumatic acute abdomen. In particular, this review is focused on the main emergency settings: acute pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction, acute appendicitis and acute diverticulitis. This survey would not be complete without mentioning Dual-Energy CT (DECT) technique, one of the last frontiers in CT, achieving encouraging results also in acute abdominal conditions."

EA within the sigmoid colon in a right-sided inguinal hernia is a rare entity with only a few cases reported. In this article, we present a case of an 80-year-old male with a palpable mass within an incarcerated right inguinal hernia. The patient underwent urgent surgical intervention due to incarceration and the operative findings were of a large indirect inguinoscrotal hernia containing sigmoid colon, with an inflamed epiploic appendage. The colon was reduced into the abdominal cavity and standard tension-free Lichtenstein repair was performed. EA should be a consideration in patients with an acute abdomen as well as those with a painful groin lump. CT is diagnostic; however, emergency surgery should not be delayed for a scan if the hernia is irreducible and tender."

The new organizational model significantly reduced the numbers of patients who left the ED without being seen from 12.9% to 5.9%. This new organizational model in the pediatric emergency department could be successfully used to reduce overcrowding, waiting time, and the numbers of patients leaving without being seen. However, more needs to be done by the pediatric services in the community to reduce nonurgent accesses to the emergency department."

It was first reported in 1864 by Hyernaux with less than 100 cases reported since the original publication. The overall mortality rate is reported as 5.6 percent. We present the case of a 49-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of moderate abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding for 1 hour. The patient reported that she underwent a robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy 11 weeks prior for uterine fibroids. Visual examination revealed a loop of the small bowel coming from the superior aspect of her vagina. Literature reviews have noted a higher incidence of dehiscence following robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy. It is important for the emergency physician to make the diagnosis, initiate prompt consultation with departments of obstetrics and gynecology and general surgery, and treat for potential infection."

    "abstract": "Chilaiditi's Sign (CS) is a radiological finding on an abdominal radiograph due to colonic interposition between the liver and the diaphragm giving a false impression of free intra peritoneal air. When accompanied by abdominal symptoms, a syndrome with the same name is diagnosed. As elusive a finding, it can be a source of diagnostic misinterpretation causing an alarming illusion of a deceptive emergency. We report a four-year-old girl presenting with an acute abdomen in a background of long-standing constipation and an illusory radiograph suggesting left-sided, free sub diaphragmatic air. Further imaging with a CECT confirmed mesenteric lymphadenitis without free peritoneal air and chronic constipation as a cause of symptoms. Expectant management resulted in gradual clinical improvement. Chilaiditi's syndrome or CS is more often described in adults and more frequently over the right side, nevertheless, can occur in children too. Knowledge of its occurrence can avoid unnecessary surgical intervention. While evaluating a child with acute abdomen, if the finding of a radiographic free sub diaphragmatic air is discordant with clinical signs, further imaging to rule out CS is important to avoid unnecessary exploration."

    "abstract": "Omental cysts are the rarest forms of intra-abdominal cystic lesions. They are usually asymptomatic but can also present as acute abdomen. The presentation is confusing in some cases, which may result in mismanagement, added costs, and trouble for the patient. A pre-operative diagnosis is challenging, especially in resource-limited settings, and requires a high level of suspicion and a cautious approach during emergency exploratory laparotomy to avoid complications. This is a 4 year old male child who presented with high grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain of 2 days duration. He was tachypneic, tachycardic, and had diffuse abdominal tenderness. Emergency laparotomy revealed a large cyst with hemorrhagic content. Complete removal of the cyst was done, and the patient was discharged after improvement on the third post-operative day. Omental cysts are rare in children and have varieties of presentations. Even though preoperative diagnosis is challenging, esspecially in resource-limited settings, clinicians should consider omental cysts in a child presenting with an acute abdomen. It is important for surgeons to consider omental cysts when carrying out emergency laparotomy for an unidentified abdominal condition."

Many causes of bowel obstruction arise from congenital anomalies and recognition of the underlying cause of obstruction can be challenging in these settings. These cases can be further complicated if two or more congenital anomalies are present. Malrotation of the gut is defined as a congenital developmental anomaly of the rotation of the intestine and encompasses a spectrum of abnormalities. Meckel's diverticulum is another congenital anomaly which occurs secondary to the failure of the vitellointestinal duct to close and can present in 2% of the population. We describe an interesting case of a 19-month-old-boy who presented acutely with symptoms of bowel obstruction and was found to have both intestinal malrotation and Meckel's diverticulum."

There was a 5-month history of increasing breast volume with new onset skin breakdown and discharge. Imaging revealed an extensive heterogeneous mass requiring drainage. No diagnosis was received from multiple biopsies and immediate surgical resection of the breast and axillary sampling was prioritised given the deteriorating patient condition. Postoperative histology identified a biphasic Adenomyoepithelioma of low malignant potential, a rare presentation compounding the complexity of management. The diagnostic uncertainty of this case highlighted the importance of MDT collaboration and the flexibility of current management pathways when dealing with cases requiring urgent surgical intervention. Axillary sampling in the context of unsuccessful preoperative biopsy represented a comprehensive means for assessing the need for further surgical or systemic management in the context of unconfirmed malignancy in a deteriorating patient."

    "abstract": "Background  Incarcerated hernia is a common surgical emergency with considerable morbidity or even mortality. Manual reduction (taxis) and elective surgery could be an alternative management approach. This study examines the role of taxis with the adjuvant use of the visual analogue scale (VAS) score in treating incarcerated hernias and thereby decreasing the emergency surgery rate, especially during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods  All adult patients admitted to the emergency department of our hospital with incarcerated hernias of anterior abdominal wall were prospectively submitted to hernia manual reduction. The VAS score was used as an adjuvant tool for monitoring the success of this maneuver. Patients with successful taxis and low VAS score were hospitalized for a 24-hour period of observation. On their discharge, they were scheduled for an elective hernia repair. Patients with unsuccessful taxis or with less than a 50% reduction in VAS score after successful taxis were submitted to emergency surgical repair. Age, sex, type of hernias, time until taxis, VAS scores before and after taxis, length of hospital stay, and adverse events for both groups were recorded. Results  Between September 2018 and September 2020, 86 patients with incarcerated hernias were included. The types of hernias were incisional in 8 patients, umbilical in 15 patients, inguinal in 56 patients, and femoral in 7 patients. Taxis was successful in 66% of patients with a mean reduction in VAS score from 83 to 17 mm. Following successful taxis, patients were hospitalized for a 24-hour period of observation. No taxis-related complications were observed. Fifty-two patients were safely discharged from hospital and scheduled for an elective repair during the first month. Thirty-four patients were operated emergently. Five patients had successful taxis but with a reduction of posttaxis VAS score less than 50% (a mean reduction from 86 to 62 mm), while taxis failed in twenty-nine patients. Patients with emergency surgery had longer time until reduction and longer stay of hospitalization. In this group, two patients required admission to the intensive care unit while one patient died. Conclusion  In this protocolized approach, taxis is a safe and feasible option for most patients with incarcerated hernias. It should be kept in our armament, especially in times when emergency surgery capabilities are under strain like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."

    "abstract": "Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, outcomes and management of many diseases have been affected. Acute appendicitis is a common acute abdomen. The incidence rate is 0.05%-0.5%. Studies reported that the number of patients with appendicitis admitted to emergency department significantly decreased since the pandemic. People avoided going to the hospital for fear of being infected. Different countries have different epidemic prevention measures that result in different treatment outcomes. The Chinese government also published some temporary measures in order to prevent the outbreak. To explore the changes in management and outcomes of acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic in the North of Beijing. Patients with acute appendicitis admitted to Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital between February and June 2019 and February and June 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were grouped according to admission year. The demographic characteristics, present illnesses, medical history, symptoms and signs, comorbidities, blood test results, imaging data, appendix pathology, and treatment details were compared. Overall, 74 patients received nonsurgical treatment and 113 patients underwent surgical treatment in group 2019, whereas 159 patients received nonsurgical treatment and 26 patients received surgical treatment in group 2020. Fever, thick appendix, nonsurgical management, and uncomplicated appendicitis (simple or supportive appendicitis) were more common in group 2020 (P < 0.05). Among the nonsurgical management cases, the neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and recurrence rate were higher in group 2020 (P < 0.05). Among surgically managed cases, there were more cases with gastrointestinal symptoms, peritonitis, ascites in the image, and intraoperative adhesion or ascites in group 2020 (P < 0.05). The white blood cell count, time from diagnosis to surgery, surgical time, and intraoperative blood loss were higher in group 2020 (P < 0.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients suffering from acute appendicitis in Beijing tended to present with severe symptoms and opt for nonsurgical treatment. For patients who underwent surgical management, the operation was delayed and more difficult during the pandemic. Nevertheless, the hospital stay and the incidence of postsurgical complications did not change."

Although AFBN has mainly been reported in pediatric patients, it may be underdiagnosed in adults as it resembles acute pyelonephritis in its clinical presentation. However, the symptoms suggesting acute abdomen is an important clue to diagnose AFBN, which requires additional imaging studies such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). Here, we present the case of a 49-year-old female presenting to our emergency room with acute abdomen as well as acute kidney injury (AKI). CECT was performed to rule out critical etiologies of severe abdominal pain and the results revealed multifocal wedge-shaped shadows in the right kidney and diffuse enlargement of bilateral kidneys. We diagnosed the patient with AFBN and treated her through temporal hemodialysis (two sessions) and antibiotics for 23 days. Although AKI associated with AFBN has rarely been reported, her renal dysfunction and other symptoms were completely improved. In conclusion, clinicians should be aware of AFBN and be cautious to avoid the unnecessary invasive interventions."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyse clinical characteristics of FB ingestion and predictive factors for complications, in order to reduce mortality and morbidity. A retrospective study of emergency surgical consultation records has been carried out from June 2005 through June 2015 yielded 201 episodes with the diagnosis of ingestion of foreign objects at the Surgical Unit of the University of Bari. Natural Removal in 44,8% of cases; Endoscopic retrieval in 42,4%, Surgical Procedures 4,4%. Statistical analysis was based on multivariate analysis and the model R2 of the Naegelkerke value. First of all, the approach to ingestion should be endoscopic. The second approach is surgical in selected cases. The most frequent site of impaction were oesophagus, stomach and right colon. An EGD proved to be the most used procedure with a no morbidity and no mortality. The ingestion of foreign bodies is a frequent, complex and expensive condition to treat. Observation and endoscopy are the most appropriate procedures to be considered to manage the ingestion of FB in Emergency Surgery Unit. Emergency surgery, Foreign bodies, Ingestion. L’ingestione di corpi estranei è facilmente osservabile nei reparti di chirurgia d’urgenza. Nonostante questi casi si presentino più frequentemente in età pediatrica, con un picco di incidenza tra i sei mesi e i sei anni, l’ingestione di corpi estranei può avvenire anche nella popolazione adulta, distinguendo un’ingestione involontaria, che è più comune in pazienti con impianti dentali, disabilità mentali e nei tossicodipendenti e avviene durante l’ingestione di cibo ed una volontaria, che invece è più frequente nei pazienti psichiatrici e tra i detenuti. Schwarz nel 1976 ha stimato, negli USA, circa 1500 decessi per anno, dovuti all’ingestione di corpi estranei. Lo studio della American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) non ha evidenziato alcun decesso tra gli 852 pazienti adulti ed ha riportato solo un caso tra i pazienti pediatrici. A volte l’ingestione di corpi estranei è seguita da complicanze potenzialmente pericolose per la vita del pz, come la perforazione o l’emorragia digestiva che richiedono un procedura chirurgica in regime di emergenza o urgenza. Fortunatamente, nella maggior parte dei casi i corpi estranei passano attraverso il tratto gastrointestinale spontaneamente, il trattamento endoscopico è necessario nel 10-20% dei casi e quello chirurgico solo nel 1-14% dei casi. Obiettivo del nostro studio osservazionale è analizzare l’incidenza, le caratteristiche l’ingestione dei CE nell’ambito dei pazienti che afferiscono al Pronto Soccorso dell’Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico di Bari ed al reparto di Chirurgia d’Urgenza nel periodo 2005- 2015 ed anche valutare eventuali fattori predittivi per eventuali complicanze per poter ridurre mortalità e morbilità. Lo studio dei registri delle consulenze chirurgiche d’emergenza ha evidenziato 201 episodi con diagnosi di ingestione di corpi estranei, occorsa in 194 pazienti esaminati presso la U.O. di Chirurgia di Urgenza dell’Università di Bari.La maggior parte dei pazienti sono adulti e solo 8 pazienti pediatrici sono stati ammessi in reparto per mancanza di letti o di endoscopisti nell’ospedale pediatrico locale. I dati demografici dei pazienti includono età, sesso, tipo, misura e posizione dei corpi estranei, scopo del ricovero, strumenti diagnostici, durata della degenza ospedaliera e trattamenti. L’iter diagnostico- terapeutico è basato sulle linee guida internazionali e sul management aziendale per cui è stata condotta una consulenza chirurgica dopo il triage e successiva identificazione e localizzazione radiografica dei corpi estranei. Molti pazienti sono stati sottoposti anche a diagnostica di II livello (TC) e a consulenze specialistiche ulteriori (consulenza otorinolaringoiatrica, psichiatrica, etc a seconda dei casi). Il chirurgo d’emergenza successivamente ha deciso per il trattamento chirurgico, endoscopico, entrambi o nessuno di questi. Dai risultati del nostro studio, si evince che l’ingestione dei corpi estranei è molto più frequente in alcune categorie di pazienti, definite a rischio: nei pazienti con patologie di vario tipo, come patologie esofago-gastriche o patologie da compressione ab estrinseco, che impediscono il passaggio del bolo attraverso il tratto gastrointestinale favorendone l’arresto; nei pazienti con patologie psichiatriche o tossicodipendenza: in questi casi l’ingestione di CE può essere spiegata da disturbi della personalità, psicosi p.d., pica e simulazione (malingering). Nel nostro campione 13 pazienti hanno rifiutato le procedure diagnostiche e di questi 5 psichiatrici. In questi casi quasi sempre l’ingestione non è reale e riferiscono di aver ingerito corpi estranei radiopachi per cui difficilmente obiettivabili. I detenuti di solito o simulano oppure reiterano il gesto. La procedura endoscopica si è rivelata quella più utilizzata. Sono state condotte 131 endoscopie, risolutive nel 65% dei casi, con bassa morbilità e assenza di mortalità. La complicanza più frequente risulta essere la perforazione gastrointestinale, avvenuta in 5 casi. L’indicazione all’intervento chirurgico c’è stata solo nel 4,9% dei pazienti. In conclusione, l’ingestione dei corpi estranei è frequente e compless da gestire. Osservazione clinica ed endoscopia rappresentano il primo approccio cui segue l’intervento chirurgico conducibile per via tradizionale o laparoscopica o in combinata laparo-endoscopica in casi selezionati. È mandatorio che sussista un’Unità di Endoscopia di Emergenza in un Presidio Ospedaliero per poter gestire questi pazienti anche per poter ridurre i costi ed il tempo di degenza."

    "abstract": "Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) represents less than 0.5% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Clinical manifestations are non-specific and diagnosis is delayed in the majority of patients. 85-year-old woman reporting accidental fall at home 20-days earlier, was admitted with diagnosed of acute abdomen from suspected two-stage rupture of the spleen. The patient complained of pain in the upper abdomen. Blood-chemical tests did not show anemia and leukocytosis, but showed increased CA19.9, CA125, LDH and beta2- microglobulin. Contrast-enhanced CT showed left pleural, perisplenic, perihepatic, and Douglas blood effusion, a neoformation of the body-tail of the pancreas with peri-pancreatic blood layer, splenomegaly due to the presence of a hypodense area as from intraparenchymal hematoma, with an apparently undamaged splenic capsule. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, that revealed the presence of modest free serohematic effusion from oozing of the pancreatic neoformation. The local spread of the disease prevented any attempt at surgical resection. Bleeding was checked with the addition of topical hemostats (Tabotamp®) and biopsy sampling of the pancreatic mass was performed. A final histological diagnosis of large cell NHL of centro-follicular origin, double expressor for the CMYC and BCL2 protein, was achieved. The age of the patient, the poor general conditions, the associated pathologies, the locally advanced spread of the disease and the histological aggressiveness, were contraindications to chemo-radiotherapy treatments. The initial misdiagnosis was due to the history of recent trauma, the uncommon clinical presentation, the underestimation of the serum increase in markers and the interpretation of the CT. Acute Abdomen, Hemoperitoneum, Primary Pancreatic Lymphoma. Il linfoma pancreatico primitivo (PPL) rappresenta meno dello 0.5% di tutte le neoplasie pancreatiche. Le manifestazioni cliniche di esordio non sono specifiche e la diagnosi è tardiva nella maggioranza dei pazienti. OSSERVAZIONE PERSONALE: Donna di 85 anni, ricoverata presso l’Ospedale Universitario “A. Fiorini” di Terracina- Polo Pontino, con diagnosi di addome acuto da sospetta rottura in due tempi della milza. Al ricovero la pz lamentava dolore a carico dei quadranti addominali superiori e riferiva caduta accidentale in casa avvenuta 20 giorni prima. Presentava esami ematochimici negativi per anemia e leucocitosi (Hb12.7g/dl; GB9.8x10/UL), significativo incremento del CA19.9 (196 U/ml), del CA125 (138 U/ml), delle LDH (1044 U/L) e della beta2-microglobulina. La CT torace-addome-pelvi con mdc mostrava versamento a densità ematica in sede pleurica sinistra, perisplenica, periepatica e nel Douglas e una neoformazione del corpo-coda pancreas con falda ematica peripancreatica. La milza appariva di dimensioni notevolmente aumentate, con presenza di area ipodensa di 12.5x10.6 cm di diametro come da ematoma intraparenchimale, con capsula splenica apparentemente indenne. La pz veniva sottoposta a laparotomia esplorativa urgente per sospetto emoperitoneo. All’apertura della cavità peritoneale si dimostrava la presenza di modesto versamento libero sieroematico da stillicidio della neoformazione pancreatica. La diffusione locale della malattia impediva ogni tentativo di resezione chirurgica. Si procedeva a controllo del sanguinamento con apposizione di emostatici topici (Tabotamp®) e a prelievo bioptico dalla neoformazione pancreatica. Si poneva diagnosi istologica finale di Linfoma Non-Hodgkin a grandi cellule di origine centro- follicolare, doppio espressore per la proteina CMYC e BCL2 all’immunoistochimica. L’età della pz, le scadenti condizioni generali, le patologie associate in trattamento poli-farmacologico, la diffusione localmente avanzata della malattia e l’aggressività istologica controindicavano il trattamento chemioradioterapico. CONCLUSIONE: La diagnosi di PPL è molto difficile e tardiva nella maggioranza dei pz, poichè le manifestazioni cliniche di esordio sono di solito aspecifiche; così come nel caso da noi riportato in cui il sanguinamento intraretro- peritoneale era difficilmente riconducibile ad una malattia pancreatica. I riferito trauma addominale, la sintomatologia clinica aspecifica, la CT in cui non erano state evidenziate le alterazioni caratteristiche dei linfomi extranodali, la sottovalutazione dell’aumento dei livelli plasmatici dei marcatori CA19-9 e CA125, delle LDH e della beta2- microglobulina, sono state nel nostro caso la causa di errata diagnosi e indicazione al trattamento chirurgico in urgenza."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen in the fetus can present as nonspecific fetal distress, and occasionally necessitate emergency cesarean section for the mother and subsequent emergency neonatal surgery. Often, preoperative diagnosis in utero is challenging. The authors herein report two cases, a case of primary segmental antenatal intestinal volvulus resulting in the mother presenting at 35 wk with symptoms and decreased fetal movements, and another case of a rapidly distending fetal abdominal mass at 31 wk manifesting as fetal hydrops. The postdelivery newborn management issues are presented. Early identification by the maternal and neonatal team allows for early neonatal surgery and can reduce morbidity and mortality. This can be facilitated by advanced maternal and child health services and efficient patient transport systems."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence, nature, and management of post-surgical emergency after-hours calls in a dental school setting with predoctoral students, graduate students/residents, and faculty providers. A patient chart review (March 2018-February 2020) for post-surgical calls through the emergency after-hours pager system was conducted at the Marquette University School of Dentistry. The total number of surgical procedures, procedure type, the timing of call, operator experience, concern, and recommendation given during the call were documented. During the review period, 83 calls (from 75 patients) were recorded after 8,487 surgical procedures (1% of procedures). Patients called 5.4 ± 0.8 days postoperatively. Procedure type affected call prevalence (p = 0.04), with most calls made after extractions (69.9% of all calls; 1% of extractions; 58/5,725), implant placement (6%; 0.9% of implant placements; 5/530) and periodontal plastic surgery (6%; 3.1% of all plastic surgeries; 5/161). The most common concern was pain (72.3%), then swelling (36.1%), bleeding (12%), and infection (9.6%). Operator experience did not affect call prevalence. Recommendations given were next business day follow-up (79.5%), reinforcement of already given postoperative instructions (51.8%), prescription (15.7%), and hospital emergency department (ED) visit (7.2%). Post-surgical emergency after-hours calls in a dental school setting occur within the first postoperative week and are rare, unrelated to operator experience, typically prompted by pain, and rarely resulting in referral to hospital ED. The use of a pager system is adequate for the management of after-hours emergencies and may reduce self-referrals to the hospital ED."

    "abstract": "Midgut volvulus in association with malrotation is a pediatric surgical emergency. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is necessary to avoid bowel ischemia and necrosis, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Historically, the fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal series has been the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of both midgut malrotation and volvulus, although the use of ultrasound (US) is increasing. In this Narrative Review, we describe the findings of midgut malrotation and volvulus on US, including practical tips for acquisition and interpretation; discuss the advantages and challenges of both imaging modalities; and propose a path and safeguards for possible transition to the use of US as the first-line modality for diagnosis based on our experience in imaging children with midgut malrotation and volvulus."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a major cause of acute abdomen. Although its diagnosis is clinical, it is often supported by complementary diagnostic tests. Sometimes, delay in diagnosis can lead to worsening of the clinical picture, resulting in a complicated acute appendicitis. Some series have studied some clinical and analytical parameters as possible predictors of complicated acute appendicitis. A retrospective analysis of patients admitted for acute appendicitis and undergoing appendectomy between January 2014 and December 2017 was performed in order to assess the possible existence of preoperative analytical predictive factors for complicated acute appendicitis (such as leukocytosis, C-reactive protein and ratio between neutrophils and lymphocytes). 841 patients underwent emergency appendectomy during the analysed period. This initial sample was divided into two groups: Group 1 with patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis and Group 2 with patients with complicated acute appendicitis. Group 2's presentation age, duration of symptoms and hospital stay was significantly higher than Group 1. Regarding analytical parameters, the measurement of leukocytes, C-reactive protein and ratio between neutrophils and lymphocytes was significantly higher in patients with complicated acute appendicitis. After a multivariate analysis, it was found that only C-reactive protein was a good predictor of complicated acute appendicitis. Several publications have studied and demonstrated the possible use of certain analytical parameters as predictors of complicated acute appendicitis. In our study, C-reactive protein proved to be a good independent predictor of complicated acute appendicitis and, therefore, when an assay of this protein exceeds 63.3 mg/L, faster surgical approach should be considered due to the high probability of the presence of a complicated picture of this clinical entity."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As NASA and private spaceflight companies push forward with plans for missions to cis-lunar and interplanetary space, the risk of surgical emergency increases. At latencies above 500 ms, telesurgery is not likely to be successful, so near-real-time telementoring is a more viable option. We examined the effect of a 700-ms time delay on the performance of first year surgical residents on a simulated task requiring significant feedback from a mentor in a pilot study.METHODS: A simulated surgical task requiring precision and accuracy with built-in error detection was used. Each resident underwent two trials, one with a mentor in the same room and one with the mentor using a teleconference with time delay. Outcomes measured included time to complete task, game pieces successfully removed, number of errors, and scores on the NASA Task Load Index by both mentor and operator. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests.RESULTS: The time delay group removed significantly fewer pieces successfully than the real time group (3.0 vs. 1.6, P = 0.02). There was no difference in the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) scores for the operators between the two groups, but the mentor reported significantly higher scores on Mental Demand (5.6 vs. 12.0, P = 0.04) and Effort (6.2 vs. 11.8, P = 0.05) during the time-delayed trials.DISCUSSION: A 750-ms time delay significantly degraded performance on the task. Though operator TLX scores were not affected, mentor TLX scores indicated significantly increased mental load. Telementoring is viable, but more onerous than in-person mentoring.Kamine TH, Smith BW, Fernandez GL. Impact of time delay on simulated operative video telementoring: a pilot study.

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children. This study aims to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected pediatric patients with acute appendicitis with regards to presentation and complications. After obtaining ethics approval, we performed a chart review of pediatric patients admitted with a diagnosis of appendicitis from March 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 and March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Data collection included a post-operative period of 30 days. The primary outcome of interest was complication rates post-appendectomy. Secondary outcomes included time to presentation, symptoms, time to surgery, and rate of perforation. Overall, 205 patients were included with 115 in the pre-pandemic group and 90 in the pandemic group. There was no significant difference in complication rates (16% pre-pandemic vs. 13.3% pandemic). In the pandemic group, time from symptom onset to presentation was significantly longer (1.87 days vs. 2.42 days, p = 0.01), more patients presented with emesis (70% vs. 55%, p<0.05), more patients had perforated appendicitis (47% vs. 32%, p<0.05), more patients were likely to be tachycardic (46% vs. 32%, p = 0.05)  and waited less time for surgery (5.75 h vs. 4.15 h, p = 0.05) which both approached significance. Significant delays in pediatric appendicitis presentation, and higher rates of tachycardia and perforation were seen during the pandemic. This did not result in increased complication rates but could suggest pandemic patients were more ill than their pre-pandemic counterparts."

    "abstract": "Some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have acute abdomen and need surgery. However, surgery in the acute phase of COVID-19 is associated with worse postoperative outcomes and an increased risk of mortality. We report a case of a patient with COVID-19 who developed intestinal perforation that was treated acutely with antibiotics and delayed surgical intervention. A 79-year-old man with COVID-19 was treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone, and his respiratory symptoms and hypoxia improved. However, abdominal symptoms developed, and intestinal perforation occurred. As the nasopharyngeal swab PCR test was positive for SARS-CoV-2, conservative treatment with tazobactam/piperacillin was started to avoid surgery in the acute phase of COVID-19. An intraperitoneal abscess was confirmed on follow-up computed tomography. Emergent laparoscopic lavage and drainage, and transverse colon stoma construction were performed with medical staff using full personal protective equipment. Bacterial culture from the ascites detected Escherichia coli and Bacteroides. The SARS-CoV-2 PCR test of the ascites sample was negative. No infection was observed in the medical staff. COVID-19 has been associated with a higher perioperative risk and postoperative mortality. There has also been a report of ascitic fluid testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR, suggesting the possibility of intraoperative aerosolization. Avoiding surgical treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 may reduce deaths from perioperative complications. Our case suggests that in acute COVID-19 lung infection, careful observation and delayed surgical treatment could prevent worsening of the COVID-19 and reduce the risk of infection to the medical staff."

Appropriate decision-making is essential to make a prompt diagnosis, accurate risk assessment, and proper resuscitation of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses, there is still controversy on various management issues like appropriate risk stratification, the timing of endoscopy, choosing an appropriate endoscopic, and radiological intervention in these groups of patients. As the usage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiplatelet, and antithrombotic agents is common in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, the physician is challenged with proper management of these drugs. The present review summarizes the current strategies for risk stratification, localization of bleeding source, endoscopic and radiological intervention in patients with acute nonvariceal upper GI, middle GI, and lower GI bleeding."

Frequently dismissed as a contaminant, it is implicated in several diseases. We describe a rare case of endocarditis caused by Lactobacillus jensenii in an immunocompetent 40 year-old male patient, with a history of mitral valve repair. He presented complaining of asthenia and his laboratory results showed a moderate increase in inflammatory markers. A trans-thoracic echocardiography confirmed a vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, with associated severe mitral insufficiency. Blood cultures revealed the significant growth of L. jensenii. The patient developed an acute abdomen with intestinal ischemia and occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, requiring urgent surgical laparotomy. A cerebral MRI showed multiple minor emboli in the frontal and left parietal cortex. The patient consequently underwent surgery to have his mitral valve replaced with a mechanical valve. L. jensenii was isolated in culture from the mitral valve and from a mesenteric artery thrombus. After one week of combined amoxicillin and gentamicin therapy, ampicillin alone was continued for a total of six weeks and the patient could be discharged in a good general condition. Only five cases of L. jensenii are described in literature, and they mainly affect immunocompromised hosts. In our case, a long delay between the start of symptoms and the full onset of the disease was observed. tolerance of Lactobacilli to penicillin is a key determinant of therapy choice."

The etiology of gallbladder volvulus is still unclear, and there is intraoperative evidence of a floating gallbladder that leads to a twisting of its pedicle, thus causing gallbladder ischemia and necrosis. Gallbladder volvulus is more frequently encounter in elderly females. We report a case of a 27-year-old female who presented with a clinical manifestation consistent with acute cholecystitis. Radiologic finding demonstrated displacement of the gallbladder body and fundus from the gallbladder fossa into the gastrohepatic recess. An emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, and intraoperative findings revealed a gangrenous free-floating gallbladder that displaced to the dorsal sector of the left lobe liver. The critical view of safety was able to identify clearly and the gallbladder was removed safely with laparoscopic approach. While many previous cases have been reported, diagnosis of gallbladder volvulus remains difficult especially in young adults. Prompt diagnosis and surgery in cases of acute cholecystitis due to gallbladder volvulus are important to avoid gallbladder necrosis and perforation and result in a good outcome."

    "abstract": "Small intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency that has a wide range of underlying etiologies. The most frequent causes of small intestinal obstruction include adhesions, hernias, and malignancies. The diagnosis of small intestinal obstruction is primarily dependent on the clinical findings, but imaging investigations are crucial to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate the complications. We report the case of a middle-aged woman with a complaint of abdominal pain for one week that was associated with abdominal distension and decreased bowel motion. Examination of the abdomen showed a distended abdomen. There was generalized tenderness, but no guarding or rigidity was noted. Initial laboratory investigation showed no derangement in the basic hematological and biochemical parameters. Abdominal CT was performed, which showed a segment of jejunojejunal intussusception causing a small intestinal obstruction. There was a well-defined, oval-shaped fat-attenuation mass lesion acting as a lead-point. Such radiological findings conferred the diagnosis of jejunojejunal intussusception due to jejunal lipoma. The patient underwent laparotomy, which confirmed the radiological finding. The intussusception was reduced, but a gangrenous intestine was observed. Resection of the affected intestine was performed, followed by a primary anastomosis. The patient recovered with no complications. Following the operation, oral feeding was started gradually according to the patient's tolerance. She was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. At the follow-up visit after three months, the patient had no active symptoms. This case illustrated a rare etiology of small intestinal obstruction due to gastrointestinal lipoma. A computed tomography scan is strongly advised to reach the diagnosis and identify the lead points."

Minimal literature is available on the topic of ischaemic gastritis, with the few cases available linked to gastric dilation. A 52 year old lady presents with a syncopal episode, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and abdominal discomfort. A chest X-ray identified free subdiaphragmatic gas, and her examination revealed a peritonitic abdomen, prompting urgent surgical intervention. She was found to have ischaemic gastritis with multiple perforations along the greater curvature, necessitating a sleeve gastrectomy. Her post-operative course was stormy, requiring significant haemodynamic and respiratory support in the intensive care unit with progressive multi-organ dysfunction. She eventually developed extensive bowel ischaemia, and further management was considered futile. She passed away 13 days post-operatively. The vascular supply of the stomach is rich with collaterals, making ischaemia unlikely. Its occurrence requires either a proximal insult, global ischaemia from pressure, or a systemic coagulopathy. Aside from perforation, it may also present with GI bleeding. Depending on its aetiology, the disease has been managed successfully either conservatively, interventionally, or operatively. Ischaemic gastritis is uncommon and likely underdiagnosed. Timely recognition of its aetiology early in its course is important, for choosing the appropriate management and to improve patient outcomes. Its management is dependent on the aetiology of the perforation."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of intussusception clinical pathways (CPs) implementation, including bedside point-of-care ultrasonography, on patient management in a pediatric ED.In January 2017, an intussusception management protocol was implemented for children with symptoms of intussusception. We retrospectively examined the charts of patients diagnosed with intussusception during the preprotocol (January 2015 to December 2016) and postprotocol (January 2017 to January 2019) periods and compared their outcomes.A total of 106 and 108 patients were included in the preprotocol and postprotocol groups, respectively. After CP implementation, the median door-to-ultrasonography time decreased from 66.5 (range: 13, 761) to 54 (20, 191) minutes; meanwhile, door-to-reduction time decreased from 121.5 (37, 1077) to 80.5 (40, 285) minutes; the median ED length of stay decreased from 440 to 303.5  minutes; and finally, admission rate increased from 18.9% to 40.7% (P < .01). There was no between-group difference in the rates of complications, readmission, emergency surgery, or reduction failure.The implementation of an intussusception CP decreased time-to-diagnosis, time-to-treatment, and ED length of stay estimates among children screened using point-of-care ultrasonography. The present findings suggest that the implementation of an intussusception CP may improve the efficiency of time and resource use."

However, no study has examined the frequency and associated factors of diagnostic errors related to lower gastrointestinal perforation. This large-scale multicenter retrospective study investigated the frequency of diagnostic errors and identified the associated factors. Factors at the level of the patient, symptoms, situation, and physician were included in the analysis. Data were collected from nine institutions, between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019. Timely diagnosis was defined as diagnosis at the first visit in computed tomography (CT)-capable facilities or referral to an appropriate medical institution immediately following the first visit to a non-CT-capable facility. Cases not meeting this definition were defined as diagnostic errors that resulted in delayed diagnosis. Of the 439 cases of lower gastrointestinal perforation identified, delayed diagnosis occurred in 138 cases (31.4%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between examination by a non-generalist and delayed diagnosis. Other factors showing a tendency with delayed diagnosis included presence of fever, absence of abdominal tenderness, and unavailability of urgent radiology reports. Initial misdiagnoses were mainly gastroenteritis, constipation, and small bowel obstruction. In conclusion, diagnostic errors occurred in about one-third of patients with a lower gastrointestinal perforation."

In the following case report, however, the etiology of intussusception was not from malignancy but rather idiopathic. This case report describes an elderly female presenting to the ED for abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and hematochezia. She underwent abdominal imaging with findings concerning for intussusception; this necessitated urgent operative intervention. She was found to have ileocolonic intussusception. Tissue biopsy was sent for analysis to evaluate for malignancy. This was negative. While emergency physicians often keep intussusception high on their list of differential diagnoses when dealing with pediatric patients with abdominal pain, it is rarely considered in the adult population.

However, the common benign etiologies include volvulus, hernia, adhesions, and strictures. Imaging studies are essential to establish the diagnosis and identify the etiology. We present the case of a 44-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and distension for a one-week duration. The pain was associated with decreased bowel motions and vomiting. Her past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and recurrent episodes of biliary colic. Upon examination, she had tachycardia, normal temperature, and normal blood pressure. Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen with generalized tenderness and increased intensity of bowel sounds. The laboratory markers were noncontributory. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast demonstrated the presence of an oval-shaped hypodense intraluminal mass in the sigmoid colon where there was a transition point with proximal colonic dilatation. There was an abnormal communication between the gallbladder and the colon at the hepatic flexure, representing a cholecystocolic fistula tract. This represents a mechanical obstruction of the large bowel due to migrated gallstone through a cholecystocolic fistula tract. The patient was prepared for an emergency laparotomy. The gallstone was removed, and the sigmoid colon was sutured primarily. Resection of the gallbladder was made with the closure of the fistula tract. Following the surgery, the patient reported a resolution of her abdominal pain. Oral feeding was started gradually. After six months of close follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no new complaints. Cholecystocolic fistula is a very rare complication of gallbladder disease. Despite its rarity, surgeons should remember this etiology of large intestinal obstruction when they encounter a patient with gallbladder disease."

A PubMed literature review of case reports and series was conducted using keywords and combinations of \"Crohn's disease,\" \"small intestine perforation,\" \"small bowel perforation,\" \"free perforation,\" \"regional enteritis,\" and \"necrotizing enteritis.\" Data extracted included demographic data, pre- or postoperative steroid administration, medical or surgical management, and case fatality. Nineteen reports from 1935 to 2021 qualified for inclusion. There were 43 patients: 20 males and 23 females with a mean age of 36 ± 15 years old. 75 total perforations were described: 56 ileal (74.6%), 15 jejunal (20.0%), 2 cecal (2.7%), and 1 small intestine non-specified (2.7%). 38 of 43 patients were managed surgically by primary repair (11), ostomy creation (21), or an anastomosis (11). Of 11 case fatalities, medical management alone was associated with higher mortality (5/5; 100% mortality) compared to those treated surgically (6/38; 15.8% mortality; P < .001). Patient sex, disease history, acute abdomen, and pre- or postoperative steroid use did not significantly correlate with mortality. Jejunal perforation was significantly (P = .028) associated with event mortality while ileal was not (P = .45).

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency amongst the paediatric population. Available diagnostic tools are focussed to make a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. A definitive predictive factor for the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis is lacking. Thus, this aims to analyse hyperbilirubinaemia as a predictor of complicated appendicitis amongst the paediatric population. A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary hospital from November 2018 to October 2019. All children undergoing emergency appendectomy were included in the study. Preoperatively, patients were evaluated clinically, and routine investigations including total and direct serum bilirubin were sent. All patients were grouped as 'simple appendicitis' or 'complicated appendicitis' based on intra-operative and histological findings. Bilirubin level was compared between these groups and analysed. A total of 52 children fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included. The mean age was 13.2 ± 4.2 years, and the male: female ratio was 2.1:1. Thirty-four (65.4%) had simple appendicitis and 18 (34.6%) had complicated appendicitis. Total bilirubin was 23.83 ± 5.94 mmol/L in the complicated appendicitis group and 13.15 ± 3.29 mmol/L in the simple appendicitis group. Direct bilirubin was 5.28 ± 2.22 mmol/L in complicated appendicitis and 2.62 ± 0.83 mmol/L in simple one. Both total and direct bilirubin were significantly high in the complicated group (P < 0.001) compared to the simple appendicitis group. On the Receiver operating curve (ROC), the best cutoff value for total and direct bilirubin was 21 and 5.5 mmol/L, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of total and direct bilirubin were 72.2%, 100%, and 61.1%, and 85.3%, respectively. It is concluded that hyperbilirubinaemia is a good predictor for paediatric complicated appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen means, the patient complains of acute abdominal symptoms that suggest a disease, which definitely or possibly threatens life and may or may not demand immediate operative interference, but often requires emergency surgical therapy. The diagnosis and management of acute abdomen forms a large part of routine duties of a general surgeon throughout his career. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical profile of acute abdomen and their frequency according to age and sex in general surgery ward of Aliabad teaching hospital. This descriptive retrospective study was performed by reviewing medical records (In-patient file) of 299 patients who admitted with diagnosis of acute abdomen between March 21, 2018 and March 21, 2019 in general surgery ward of Aliabad teaching hospital. Males were affected more than females with male to female ratio being 1,14:1. Highest number of patients were in 15-24 years of life (n = 122, 40,8%). The most common cause was found to be acute appendicitis for acute abdomen, accounting for 57,5% of total admission. It was followed by acute intestinal obstruction (20,7%) and acute cholecystitis (10,4%). The most common symptom was abdominal pain and most common surgical procedures were open appendectomy for acute appendicitis followed by explorative laparotomy. The complications (Clavien-Dindo = IIIb) and mortality rate in our study were 17% and 3.6% respectively. Abdominal pain is one of the cardinal and common symptom of acute abdomen in the emergency department. The causes of acute abdominal pain have a wide range and their relative incidence varies in different populations. Clinicians think seriously multiple diagnoses, especially in those cases that require immediate intervention to limit morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "We report the case of a 2-month-old boy who presented with emesis and was initially thought to have an intussusception based on ultrasound findings, but was later found to have malrotation with midgut volvulus. He was surgically detorsed before any bowel necrosis occurred, but later developed recurrent volvulus due to a surgical adhesion acting as an anchor point. The aim of this report is to highlight the imaging similarities and differences between intussusception and the more serious midgut volvulus in order to expedite proper care and preserve bowel. Malrotation with midgut volvulus is a pediatric surgical emergency involving twisting of a congenitally shortened mesentery around the superior mesenteric artery, leading to rapid vascular compromise and ischemic necrosis of small bowel. Prompt diagnosis is critical but difficult, as imaging findings in volvulus can appear similar to those in intussusception. Treatment with a Ladd procedure can safely and effectively reduce the volvulus and prevent recurrence."

    "abstract": "Peptic ulcer perforation is a common surgical emergency and a major cause of death especially in elderly patients, despite the fact of the presence of effective drug treatments and an increased understanding of its etiology. Giant duodenal perforations, in particular, pose a significant challenge and there is scarce data regarding their optimal management. Laparoscopic surgery is advocated in the surgical treatment of perforated duodenal ulcer disease, in experienced hands. Herein we present an 84-year-old man with past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension who was admitted to our Department due to epigastric pain and diffuse peritonitis. CT scan revealed the presence of a significant amount of free air and fluid in the upper abdomen secondary to a duodenal perforation. The patient was taken immediately to the theater for an urgent laparoscopy. Methylene blue via the NG tube better defined the extent of the duodenal perforation which was not amenable to a primary repair. Consequently, a decision was made for a laparoscopic pancreas-sparing, ampulla preserving gastroduodenectomy with intracorporeal Billroth II gastrojejunal anastomosis. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 13th postoperative day. Histopathology revealed a large benign duodenal ulcer. Although the incidence of peptic ulcer disease is decreasing, it appears that the incidence of complications is rising. Laparoscopic approach, especially when performed by laparoscopic surgery experts, could be a treatment option for difficult duodenal ulcer perforations with less pain, shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder torsion is a congenital abnormality of the gallbladder and is a rare cause of acute abdomen. Although gallbladder torsion is a life-threatening condition requiring emergency surgery, laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder torsion in pediatric patients has seldom been reported. A 3-year-old boy with abdominal pain and vomiting was admitted to our hospital. He was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis through abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography, and he received antibiotics. Two days after admission, a repeat abdominal ultrasound revealed exacerbation of gallbladder wall thickness and lack of intramural blood flow, which led to a diagnosis of gallbladder torsion. Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, and the gallbladder was twisted counterclockwise at 270°. After an uneventful course of intraoperative and postoperative treatment, the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder torsion was safely performed in a pediatric patient."

We present the case of a 33-year-old woman with no relevant pathological antecedents who consulted for abdominal pain for 5 days, associated with rebound tenderness and abdominal guarding on the right lower quadrant and a palpable mass during the physical examination. Computed tomography was realized and emergency surgery performed due to suspected ileocolic intussusception. The laparoscopic examination identified an ileocolic intussusception associated with a tumor. Conversion to open surgery was needed, and an oncological right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse anastomosis was carried out. Histopathological study reported ileocolic intussusception and a focus of cecal endometriosis. Currently, the patient does not have recurrences. Ileocolic intussusception secondary to deep endometriosis requires great diagnostic presumption in women of childbearing age with acute abdomen diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Tracheo-innominate artery fistulas are a rare complication of indwelling tracheotomies with a very high mortality rate. Due to the rare occurrence of this surgical emergency, most medical providers have little to no training or experience in recognizing, stabilizing, and repairing this life-threatening condition. Simulation of rare emergencies helps close knowledge gaps of medical providers at all levels. Although many providers may never experience these emergencies throughout their careers in clinical medicine, it is imperative that they distinguish and apply techniques for temporizing these life-threatening conditions in order to decrease patient mortality. This novel, low-cost, and easy-to-implement simulation is geared towards this goal and has been successfully tested in small group simulations at one academic center in San Antonio, Texas."

A 32-year-old-male from Nepal with a chief complain of diffuse abdominal pain for a day and signs of peritonitis presented to Emergency room. After assessing and stabilizing the patient, explorative laparotomy was performed. Ileal and sigmoid resection followed by colo-colic anastomosis and double barrel ileostomy was done. On regular follow-up, he is in his usual state of health. The incidence of ileosigmoid knotting is reported to be about 1.6 cases per year. It is often misdiagnosed as non-specific intestinal obstruction which confers poor prognostic value to the patient. It should be identified promptly and intervened timely. Ileosigmoid knotting is a rare but dangerous differential of acute abdomen not to be missed. Early assessment and quick decision making is the key to provide excellent prognosis to the patient in need, provided adequate surgical skills are demonstrated."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection is a global pandemic that affected routine health services and made patients fear to consult for medical health problems, even acute abdominal pain. Subsequently, the incidence of complicated appendicitis increased during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate recurrent appendicitis after successful drainage of appendicular abscess during COVID-19. A prospective cohort study conducted in the surgical emergency units of our Universities' Hospitals between March 15, 2020 to August 15, 2020 including patients who were admitted with the diagnosis of an appendicular abscess and who underwent open or radiological drainage. Main outcomes included incidence, severity, and risk factors of recurrent appendicitis in patients without interval appendectomy. A total of 316 patients were included for analysis. The mean age of the patients was 37 years (SD ± 13). About two-thirds of patients were males (60.1%). More than one-third (39.6%) had co-morbidities; type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (22.5%) and hypertension (17.1%) were the most frequent. Approximately one quarter (25.6%) had confirmed COVID 19 infection. About one-third of the patients (30.4%) had recurrent appendicitis. More than half of them (56.3%) showed recurrence after three months, and 43.8% of patients showed recurrence in the first three months. The most frequent grade was grade I (63.5%). Most patients (77.1%) underwent open surgery. Age, T2DM, hypertension, COVID-19 infection and abscess size >3 cm were significantly risking predictors for recurrent appendicitis. Interval appendectomy is suggested to prevent 56.3% of recurrent appendicitis that occurs after 3 months. We recommend performing interval appendectomy in older age, people with diabetes, COVID-19 infected, and abscesses more than 3 cm in diameter. Is interval appendectomy preventing a high incidence of recurrent appendicitis after successful drainage of appendicular abscess during COVID-19 pandemic?"

    "abstract": "Acute arterial thrombosis after hip arthroplasty is a rare event associated with potentially catastrophic complications. Early clinical diagnosis of progressive limb ischemia is often difficult in the immediate postoperative period because of residual neuraxial blockade and the nonspecific nature of signs. We describe the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) to diagnose this complication early and facilitate timely intervention. A 78-yr-old female patient underwent elective right hip revision arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia and postoperatively had an absent dorsalis pedis pulse on her operative leg as screened by an audible-only Doppler. No obvious clinical symptoms were present as the patient was still under subarachnoidal blockade. A bedside POCUS vascular evaluation was performed in the PACU and showed an absence of blood flow in the superficial femoral artery, expediting the confirmation of a surgical emergency. The patient underwent a successful open thrombectomy and made an uneventful postoperative recovery. Our case report highlights the novel use and impact of bedside POCUS to assess the presence or absence of distal limb arterial blood flow and, in this case, the level of arterial occlusion. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: La thrombose artérielle aiguë après arthroplastie de la hanche est un événement rare associé à des complications potentiellement catastrophiques. Le diagnostic clinique précoce de l’ischémie progressive du membre est souvent difficile à poser dans la période postopératoire immédiate en raison du bloc neuraxial résiduel et de la nature non spécifique des signes. Nous décrivons l’utilisation de l’échographie ciblée (POCUS) en salle de réveil (SDR) pour diagnostiquer cette complication rapidement et faciliter une intervention rapide. CARACTéRISTIQUES CLINIQUES: Une patiente de 78 ans a bénéficié d’une arthroplastie non urgente de révision de la hanche droite sous rachianesthésie; après l’intervention, le pouls pédieux, tel que dépisté par un Doppler uniquement sonore, était absent au niveau de la jambe opérée. Aucun symptôme clinique évident n’était présent alors que la patiente était toujours sous bloc sous-arachnoïdien. Une évaluation vasculaire d’échographie ciblée a été réalisée en salle de réveil et montrait l’absence de circulation sanguine dans l’artère fémorale superficielle, confirmant l’urgence chirurgicale. La patiente a bénéficié d’une thrombectomie ouverte réussie et s’est rétablie sans incident après l’opération. CONCLUSION: Notre présentation de cas met en évidence l’utilisation innovante et l’impact de l’échographie ciblée pour évaluer la présence ou l’absence du flux sanguin artériel distal et, dans ce cas, le niveau de l’occlusion artérielle."

    "abstract": "Background: In the case of patients admitted with acute abdomen at the emergency department, interstitial pulmonary pathology (Covid-19 infections) represents a significant operative risk for the patients. The rate of postoperative complications is high with increased morbidity and mortality, a real challenge for the medical staff and surgical/intensive care unit teams. In emergency settings, patients were examined with targeted clinical and paraclinical parameters that assure a fast diagnosis to optimize a rapid medical and surgical treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective comparative study that included patients enrolled and diagnosed with an acute surgical abdomen in Surgical Clinic 1 Tg. Mures Emergency County Hospital. Patients were examined and analyzed at the emergency department UPU-SMURD. We included patients admitted over the two years (2019 and 2020) and divided them into two groups. Results: The total number of patients admitted in the UPU-Smurd emergency department Surgical Clinic I over the two years was 1033. There was a significant reduction in total cases diagnosed with the acute surgical abdomen in the pandemic period (p=0.033). The average time from the admission to the surgical procedure was significantly higher in the pandemic period 380Ã+-2 min in comparison with 222+-3 min (p=0.001) and also with an increased average operative time 223+-3 min versus 145+-2 min (p=0.002). Average hospitalization time was higher in the pandemic period 10+-1 (p=0.031) with no significant difference between the groups regarding Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission (p=0.122). Overall mortality has more than doubled, with 31 cases (19%) in the pandemic and 28 (9%) in the non-pandemic. (p=0.001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has played an essential role in treating acute surgical abdomen cases. The high solicitation rate of the emergency department delayed the diagnosis and treatment of severe surgical cases. As the scale of this pandemic is unprecedented, standard protocols with minor changes do not provide adequate results."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most frequently seen surgical emergency in pregnant women and the most frequently encountered cause of non-obstetric acute abdomen. Due to the physiological and anatomical changes that occur during pregnancy and the limited use of radiological methods, it is difficult to diagnose AA during pregnancy. These conditions increase the risk of morbidity and mortality; therefore, it is crucial to identify ideal laboratory markers that can be utilized to diagnose disease. One hundred and ten pregnancies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for AA diagnosis were retrospectively analysed between 2010 and 2021. Markers with high diagnostic values were discussed. The patients were divided into three groups as follows; Group I: negative appendectomy (n = 19); Group IIa: uncomplicated appendicitis (n = 59); Group IIb: complicated appendicitis (n = 32). There was no statistically significant difference in mean age or gestational week (P > 0.05). Group IIb had a higher rate of complications and a longer length of hospital stay (P < 0.05). There were significant differences between the groups in terms of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), C-reactive protein, lymphocyte-to- C-reactive protein ratio, total, direct, and indirect bilirubin values (P < 0.05). While platelet and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values did not differ substantially between groups, both were found to have a high diagnostic value. It was concluded that WBC, neutrophil, NLR, PLR, total, direct and indirect bilirubin levels could be utilized to diagnose AA. Moreover, levels of WBC, neutrophil, NLR, platelet, PLR, LDH, total, direct and indirect bilirubin can be utilized to diagnose complicated appendicitis."

A single-institution retrospective assessment of all pediatric patients (<18 years old) with acute appendicitis from December 2019 to June 2020 was performed at a tertiary care children's hospital. Patients were divided into two groups: (1) the Pre-COVID group presented on or before March 15, 2020, and (2) the COVID group presented after March 15, 2020. Demographic, preoperative, and clinical outcomes data were analyzed. 45 patients were included with a median age of 13 years [IQR 9.9 - 16.2] and 35 males (78%). 28 patients were in the Pre-COVID group (62%) and 17 in the COVID group (38%). There were no differences in demographics or use of diagnostic imaging. The COVID group did have a significantly delayed presentation from symptom onset (36 vs 24 hours, P < .05), higher Pediatric Appendicitis Scores (8 vs 6, P = .003), and longer hospital stays (2.2 vs 1.3 days, P = .04). There were no significant differences for rates of re-admission, re-operation, surgical site infection, perforation, or abscess formation. During the Coronavirus-19 pandemic, the incidence of pediatric acute appendicitis was approximately 40% lower. These children presented in a delayed fashion with longer hospital stays.

Its etiology includes the presence of luminal obstruction by faecoliths, lymphoid hyperplasia, impacted stool, and rarely by appendiceal or caecal cancer. Malignancy related to acute appendicitis is usually seen in the older age group. Aim To identify the subset rate of patients operated for acute appendicitis who have appendiceal carcinoma and analyze the outcome of their post-operative management. Material and methods A retrospective study of a cohort of 529 patients aged > 40 diagnosed with acute appendicitis with subsequent appendectomy in the period between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2019 at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital, Essex, United Kingdom was conducted. We analyzed the clinical data of the cohort including demographic information, diagnosis, pre-operative imaging, histological diagnosis as well as post-operative management where indicated. Results The median age of patients was 54.5 years (range 40-92). The male to female ratio in the appendicectomy cohort was 1:1.1. About 45% were aged 40-49 years, 24.8% were aged 50-59 and 30.2% were ≥60 years. Post-operative histology revealed acute appendicitis in 82.4% of the group. In 11% of the patients, the histology revealed the presence of other benign pathology as mucocele of the appendix, acute diverticulitis, follicular hyperplasia, and fibrous obliteration. The diagnosis of appendicular malignancy was seen in 1.9%. Conclusion Incidental appendiceal cancers in the resected specimens after acute appendicitis are rare but may be associated with a poor prognosis. It is recommended to consider such diagnosis in particular when dealing with acute appendicitis in older patients with longer symptom history, and in presence of peri-appendicular mass."

A retrospective observational cohort study was carried out at two district general hospitals in the UK for boys aged ≤16 years presenting with acute scrotal pain between January 2014 and October 2017 managed by adult general surgery (AGS) at one hospital and adult urology (AU) at the other. Some 565 patients were eligible for inclusion (n=364 AGS, n=201 AU). A higher proportion of patients underwent surgical exploration at AGS compared with AU (277/346 (80.1%) vs 96/201 (47.8%); p<0.001). Of those who underwent exploration, 101/373 (27.1%) had TT, of whom 25/101 (24.8%) underwent orchidectomy and 125/373 (33.5%) had torted testicular appendage. There was no statistically significant difference in rates of orchidectomy between AGS (19/68, 27.9%) and AU (6/33, 18.2%) with testicular salvage rates of 72.1% and 81.8%, respectively (p=0.334). Patients were twice as likely to be readmitted at AGS as at AU (28/346 (8.1%) vs 8/201 (4.0%); p=0.073). Although intraoperative findings were similar between adult general surgeons and urologists, there were significant differences in surgical management, with a higher rate of surgical exploration by general surgeons. Testicular salvage and 30-day postoperative morbidity rates at both institutions were acceptable but the readmission rate was high at 6.6%. It is not known why there is a heterogeneity in management of acute scrotal pain between specialist centres, and further prospective investigations are warranted."

It is a rare, life-threatening disease and needs early diagnosis through acute clinical awareness. It warrants urgent and aggressive surgical management. We report a rare and fatal case of spontaneous necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) of the anterior abdominal wall caused by Finegoldia magna in a chronic diabetic patient. The initial presentation and radiological features suggested a pelvic abscess. Other acute abdomen differentials were also considered, and the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy where a necrotic anterior abdominal wall with copious purulent secretions was noted. The organism Finegoldia magna was identified from the necrotic tissue sample with other cultures coming back negative. The risk posed by NSTIs is very high, and hence though the incidence is low, clinicians should be aware of the potential dangers of this disease to avoid delays in initiating appropriate treatment."

Eighteen male, Wistar albino rats were divided into 3 groups. The sham group which is applied surgical stress. The ischemia/reperfusion group (I/R) which detorsion performed 1 h later than testicular torsion application. I/R + NaHS treatment group, NaHS solution was injected intraperitoneally for 1 week. On the 7th day of the detorsion all left testes were fixed in Bouin solution and sent to Pathology Department for histopathological examination. All right testes were washed with normal saline, dried in a sterile way and stored in - 80 °C deepfreeze up to the date of biochemical processes. Testicular tissues were obtained for the detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO), malondialdehyde (MDA), AOPP (advanced oxidation protein product) for oxidant markers and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD),glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities for antioxidant markers and histopathological exploration. The effects of NaHs administration on oxidation were evaluated by determination of testicular MPO, MDA and AOPP levels. Increased testicular MPO (58.6%) activity was observed in the I/R group compared to the sham group. Following NaHS treatment, MPO (26.7%) activity was significantly decreased in rats exposed to I/R injury (Figure 1). MDA levels did not alter. Increases in AOPP (20.9%) levels were observed in the I/R group. NaHS treatment resulted in significant decreases in AOPP (25.1%) levels in testes tissues of rats exposed to I/R injury. The effects of NaHS treatment on antioxidant system FRAP, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px activities were evaluated. GSH levels were significantly increased in the IR + NaHS group compared to the I/R group. In histopathological examination degeneration of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenic cells were observed in the I/R group. After NaHS treatment, normal spermatogenic activity with many spermatozoa in the lumen of most seminiferous tubules were observed in the I/R injured rats. According to Johnsen's scoring (JS), the I/R group was significantly decreased compared to the sham group. JS values for the I/R + NaHS group were significantly increased compared to the I/R group. Our study supports that ischemia/reperfusion injury plays an important role in the testicular torsion injury, and it is a pioneer study showing that H₂S may have a potential for therapeutic effect. The limitation of this work is this is an experimental study with limited number of animals. According to the results of our study, hydrogen sulfide treatment has beneficial effects on biochemical and histopathological results of testicular injury in testic torsion."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis remains the most common intra-abdominal surgical emergency, yet many patients receive postoperative antibiotics and intra-abdominal drains against recommended guidelines. This study assesses the impact of an educational poster on the appropriate use of postoperative antibiotics and intra-abdominal drains in appendicectomy patients. Patients who underwent an appendicectomy between January and April 2019 ('Poster absent' group) as well as between November 2019 and February 2020 ('Poster present' group) were identified. Data were collected on patient demographics, the presence of complicating features (ie appendiceal abscesses, intraperitoneal pus, gangrene and/or perforation) as well as the use of postoperative antibiotics and intra-abdominal drains in accordance with World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines. One hundred and thirty patients were included in the 'Poster absent' (73 patients) and 'Poster present' (57 patients) groups. After introducing the educational poster there was a significant reduction in the use of postoperative antibiotics (60.5% to 13.8%; p<0.0001) and an insignificant reduction in intra-abdominal drain use (15.2% to 13.2% p>0.05) that were contraindicated in simple appendicitis. There was a significant improvement in the use of postoperative antibiotics (71.9% to 100%; p=0.0019) and an insignificant increase in intra-abdominal drain use (58.8% to 64.3%; p>0.05) that were indicated in complicated appendicitis. The rates of wound infection (4.10% to 0%; p=0.2556) and ileus/obstruction (5.48% to 1.75%; p=0.3846) also reduced. This small study demonstrated that a simple and appropriately targeted intervention of an educational poster can significantly improve and reduce variation in the management of appendicectomy patients and may reduce postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Approximately one-third of patients with acute Stanford type B or DeBakey type III aortic dissection (TBAD) will develop complications, including persistent symptoms, malperfusion, enlarging aneurysms and impending rupture. In these cases, TBAD becomes a surgical emergency that requires endovascular intervention to complement the medical therapy. The immediate goal of endovascular therapy is to reestablish flow to the true lumen, stabilize the aneurysm and prevent rupture. Long-term goals are the remodeling of the descending thoracic aorta and the prevention of further surgeries in the thoracoabdominal aorta. In this report, we describe our step-by-step endovascular approach to TBAD repair."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is among the most common presentations observed in clinical practice. The present study describes a patient with isolated duodenal ischemia as an extremely rare etiology of acute abdomen. A 79-year-old male with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting presented to the emergency department of our hospital. He was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome 7 years ago, for which he took thalidomide and erythropoietin as the main medications. The prominent findings of the physical examination were hypotension, tachycardia, fever, mild hypoxemia, and epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness of the abdomen. Except for mildly increased creatinine and lipase, other laboratory findings were in concordance with myelodysplastic syndrome. Due to the patient's oliguria, the computed tomography (CT) scan was performed without contrast, which, together with the ultrasonography, raised the clinical impression of acute pancreatitis. The patient's hypotension was refractive to supportive treatment, resulting in progressive deterioration of the clinical condition. A later contrast-enhanced CT scan suggested microvascular ischemia of the duodenum. An emergent Whipple's procedure was planned initially, which was later switched to a damage control surgery due to the patient's cardiac arrest during the surgery. Despite all the supportive therapy provided at the intensive care unit, the patient expired of a cardiac arrest which occurred two hours after the termination of the surgery. The high rate of mortality in duodenal necrosis necessitates emergent diagnosis and proper management. When other common etiologies are ruled out, clinicians should consider duodenal pathology as a potential cause of acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is one of the most common paediatric surgical emergencies occurring in about 7% of healthy children. To make a definitive diagnosis preferably avoiding unnecessary X-ray radiation exposure, ultrasound is the ideal modality. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of sonographic findings in children with acute appendicitis and comparing them with surgical findings to demonstrate the safety, simplicity and accuracy of this procedure in emergency departments as the first diagnostic procedure. One hundred and eight children aged 1-15 years suspected of acute appendicitis in our tertiary hospital emergency department enrolled the study. Patients presenting as acute abdomen suspected as having acute appendicitis underwent abdominal ultrasonography (US) at first. Sonographic findings were compared to surgical and pathologic results, and sensitivity and specificity of each sonographic parameter in paediatric appendicitis were evaluated. The analysis of sonographic results showed that 67.6% of patients had acute appendicitis, 13.9% had perforated appendicitis and 18.5% had normal appendix. On the other hand, there were acute appendicitis in 63.9% of patients, perforated appendicitis in 12% and normal appendix in 8.3% in surgical reports. Sensitivity of uncompressible appendicitis, appendicitis, maximal outer diameter (MOD) above 6 mm, maximal mural thickness (MMT) above 3 mm, round appendix was 98.68%, 28.04%, 94.74%, 61.84% and 68.42%, respectively. Specificity of incompressible appendicitis, appendicitis, MOD above 6 mm, MMT above 3 mm, round appendix was 64.71%, 96.15%, 64.71%, 82.35% and 94.12%, respectively. Overall sensitivity and specificity of US in appendicitis were 97.56% and 69.23%, respectively. According to the findings of this study, sensitivity of US in diagnosing appendicitis is higher than other studies, but its specificity was lower. Ultrasonographic accuracy and efficacy to diagnose acute appendicitis in children are high enough to allow clinicians to do it as an imaging modality of first choice, and also, in problematic cases to assist correct clinical diagnosis avoiding unnecessary X-ray exposure, decreasing negative appendectomies, decreasing perforation rate and lowering the cost of patients. Furthermore, negative US do not justify immediate computed tomography because clinical re-evaluation and a second US can help greatly the clinicians in the correct diagnosis."

Preoperative diagnosis of LSAA is a challenge because of its rarity and atypical presentation. Imaging may be helpful for determining the correct diagnosis. Surgery represents the standard treatment of LSAA. A 67-year-old Caucasian male with presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. Physical examination revealed LLQ abdominal rebound tenderness with guarding. Laboratory tests reported high levels of C-reactive protein and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a LSAA with intraluminal appendicoliths, fat infiltration and pericecal fluid collection in a patient with SVI. The patient underwent laparoscopic appendectomy: a gangrenous and perforated appendicitis was sectioned and removed with drainage of pericecal abscess. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. LSAA is characterized by anatomical variation of appendix and atypical presentation. Preoperative clinical diagnosis of LSAA is very difficult and imaging may be helpful for determining the correct diagnosis, as well as confirming SVIT or MM. Laparoscopic appendectomy represents the correct treatment of LSAA. LSAA is a rare surgical emergency that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with LLQ abdominal pain. Preoperative diagnosis of LSAA needs a high index of suspicion and is facilitated by imaging. Surgery represents the appropriate treatment of LSAA."

    "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Acute Appendicitis in Adults: A Review.",
    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the world, with an annual incidence of 96.5 to 100 cases per 100 000 adults. The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on history and physical, laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Classic symptoms of appendicitis include vague periumbilical pain, anorexia/nausea/intermittent vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, and low-grade fever. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made in approximately 90% of patients presenting with these symptoms. Laparoscopic appendectomy remains the most common treatment. However, increasing evidence suggests that broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy or combination therapy with either cephalosporins or fluroquinolones with metronidazole, successfully treats uncomplicated acute appendicitis in approximately 70% of patients. Specific imaging findings on computed tomography (CT), such as appendiceal dilatation (appendiceal diameter ≥7 mm), or presence of appendicoliths, defined as the conglomeration of feces in the appendiceal lumen, identify patients for whom an antibiotics-first management strategy is more likely to fail. CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, and a dilated appendix greater than 13 mm are associated with higher risk of treatment failure (≈40%) of an antibiotics-first approach. Therefore, surgical management should be recommended in patients with CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, or a dilated appendix who are fit for surgery, defined as having relatively low risk of adverse outcomes or postoperative mortality and morbidity. In patients without high-risk CT findings, either appendectomy or antibiotics can be considered as first-line therapy. In unfit patients without these high-risk CT findings, the antibiotics-first approach is recommended, and surgery may be considered if antibiotic treatment fails. In unfit patients with high-risk CT findings, perioperative risk assessment as well as patient preferences should be considered. Acute appendicitis affects 96.5 to 100 people per 100 000 adults per year worldwide. Appendectomy remains first-line therapy for acute appendicitis, but treatment with antibiotics rather than surgery is appropriate in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis."

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is characterized by episodic bursts of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, affecting chronic cannabis users. The clinical picture mimics an acute abdomen, usually leading to multiple assessments in the emergency department. Several complementary diagnostic examinations are performed with non-specific results, making differential diagnosis puzzling. We present a case of a 42-year-old man, who has been admitted multiple times to the emergency department in the last 3 months for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, without triggering factors and improving only with hot water baths. He was evaluated by different specialties, the various complementary diagnostic tests performed showed no significant results, and no definitive diagnosis was obtained. Treatment resulted only in a partial and transient resolution of symptoms. A more detailed medical history revealed cannabis use for more than 5 years, with a recent increase in the amount consumed. After psychoeducation, explaining the risks associated with consumption and its relationship with the clinical symptoms, which resulted in complete suspension of cannabis, there have been no new symptomatic episodes since then. We present an illustrative case of a poorly reported clinical entity despite having a probable significant prevalence, raising awareness in order that clinicians identify and properly manage these cases. A Síndrome Hiperemética dos Canabinóides cursa com crises episódicas de náuseas, vómitos e dor abdominal que acometem consumidores crónicos de cannabis. O quadro clínico mimetiza o de um abdómen agudo, condicionando habitualmente múltiplas avaliações no Serviço de Urgência (SU) que levam à realização de vários exames complementares de diagnóstico (ECD), cujos resultados tendem a ser inespecíficos, dificultando o diagnóstico diferencial. Apresentamos o caso de um homem de 42 anos de idade, sem antecedentes psiquiátricos conhecidos, que nos últimos 3 meses foi admitido por múltiplas vezes no SU Hospitalar por dor abdominal, náuseas e vómitos aliviados com banhos de água quente. Vários exames auxiliares de diagnóstico e avaliação por diferentes especialidades foram realizados, sem que se obtivesse um diagnóstico definitivo. A terapêutica sintomática instituída resultou apenas numa resolução parcial e transitória dos sintomas. Uma história clínica mais detalhada revelou um consumo de cannabis há mais de 5 anos, com incremento recente da quantidade consumida. Após psicoeducação ao doente, explicando os riscos do consume de canabinóides e a sua relação com a sintomatologia apresentada resultou na suspensão completa no consume de cannabis, não se tendo verificado novos episódios sintomáticos desde então. Este é um caso ilustrativo de uma entidade clínica recente, cuja prevalência está a aumentar, tendo em conta o aumento do consumo de cannabis. A adequada identificação desta patologia é fundamental para um tratamento adequado e eficaz, evitando o uso desnecessário de métodos complementares de diagnóstico e medicação."

    "abstract": "There is variation in care quality and outcomes for children undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, such as appedectomy. Addressing this requires paediatric-specific quality metrics. The aim of this study was to identify perioperative structure and process measures that are associated with improved outcomes for these children. We performed a systematic review searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for articles published between January 1, 1980 and September 29, 2020 about the perioperative care of children undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. We also conducted secondary searching of references and citations, and we included international professional publications. We identified and analysed 383 peer-reviewed articles and 18 grey literature publications. High-grade evidence pertaining to the perioperative care of this patient group is limited. Most of the evidence available relates to improving diagnostic accuracy using preoperative blood testing, imaging, and clinical decision tools. Processes associated with clinical outcomes include time lapse between time of presentation or initial assessment and surgery, and the use of particular analgesia and antibiotic protocols. Structural factors identified include hospital and surgeon caseload and the use of perioperative care pathways. This review summarises the structural and process measures associated with outcome in paediatric emergency abdominal surgery. Such measures provide a means of evaluating care and identifying areas of practice that require quality improvement, especially in children with appendicitis. PROSPERO CRD42017055285."

The aim of the present study was to communicate our experience in the management of esophageal perforation, evaluating the different strategies utilized, in an effort to establish measures to guide decision-making in selecting treatment. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted on patients diagnosed with esophageal perforation at our hospital center, within the time frame of 2000 and 2019. Over the past 19 years, 15 patients were diagnosed with esophageal perforation. Surgical treatment was carried out in 80% of the cases. Primary closure, reinforced with plasty, was performed in 67% of the patients, of whom 62.5% had early diagnosis and a 100% survival rate. Diagnosis was late in 37.5% of the cases, with a 33.3% survival rate. Esophagectomy and gastric pull-up were performed on 25% of the patients, 66.6% of whom had early diagnosis and a 100% survival rate. In the 33.3% that had late diagnosis, the mortality rate was 100%. Esophagectomy, with cervical esophagostomy and feeding jejunostomy, was performed on one of the patients (8.3%) that had early diagnosis and a 100% survival rate. The main survival predictor in esophageal perforation is the interval of time between the injury and its diagnosis, and in turn, the resulting treatment. Each patient with esophageal perforation should have individualized treatment to adequately manage the condition."

Interplay of contributing elements determines its occurrence but, in children, LT with partial liver grafts seems to be the most important causative factor. This retrospective study describes the clinical scenario and outcomes of 11 patients with acquired DH following LDLT. During the study period, 1109 primary pediatric LDLT were performed (0.8% DH). The median age and BW of the recipients with DH at transplantation were 17 months and 11.1 kg, respectively; 63.7% of the cases had a weight/age Z-score of less than -2 at transplantation. The median interval between transplantation and diagnosis of DH was 114 days (32-538 days). A total of 6 (54.5%) of the patients had bowel obstruction due to bowel migration into the hemithorax. Ten defects were right-sided. Three patients required enterectomy and enterorrhaphy. Two patients required a new bilioenteric anastomosis, and one of them had complete necrosis of the Roux-in-Y limb. The patient with left-side DH presented gastroesophageal perforation. Most defects necessitate primary closure as the first treatment, and recurrence is rare. The associated problems encountered, especially related to intestinal complications, can determine increased morbidity following DH repair. Early diagnosis and intervention are required for achieving better outcomes."

Preoperative risk assessment with good predictors is an appropriate measure in this population. Frailty status is significantly associated with postoperative outcomes in older adults. This study aimed to investigate the effect of preoperative risk factors and frailty on short-term outcomes following emergency surgery for acute abdomen in older patients. This study included older patients (≥65 years of age) who underwent emergency abdominal surgery. We retrospectively analyzed their demographic and clinical variables and used the modified Frailty Index-11 to evaluate their frailty status. The primary outcome was the 30-day mortality rate. We also analyzed risk factors of mortality in these patients. The study included 150 patients with a median age of 74 years. The mortality rate was 17.3% (n=26). We observed significantly higher mortality rates in patients who were obese and who had higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA grades) (p<0.05). Frailty status was worse in deceased group (p<0.001), when compared to individuals who survived. Septic shock was associated with the development of mortality (p<0.001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that ASA grade was the only independent risk factor for mortality (odds ratio=19.642; 95% confidence interval, 3.886-99.274; p<0.001). Older patients with obesity and frailty presenting with higher ASA grades and septic shock had the worst survival following emergency abdominal surgery.

It results from the incarceration of the upstream intestinal segment in the downstream segment. In the majority of cases it is idiopathic, but can be secondary to certain pathologies notably Meckel's diverticulum. The site is most often ileo cecal. The symptomatological triad is made up of pain, vomiting, and rectal bleeding. The diagnosis is confirmed by imaging, dominated by ultrasound which remains the reference imaging. We report the case of a 3 year-old boy, followed for a malformation who presented with abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. The diagnosis of acute ileo-ileal intussusception was made. After an attempt at hydrostatic reduction under ultrasound guidance, he underwent surgical management. The postoperative period was simple and uncomplicated. Intestinal intussusception remains a pathology with a low morbidity and mortality rate of 0% to 1% due to delayed diagnosis and delayed therapeutic management."

Despite remaining asymptomatic most of the time, the rarity of its occurrence is reflected by the scarcity of data involving it in the literature. Gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction, and inflammation are the most prevalent complications of MD. Perforation of MD is very rare. We present the case of a previously healthy 32-year-old female, who presented to the emergency department with a 2-day-history of generalized abdominal pain. Radiological analysis suggested a perforated viscus and an inflamed Appendix. Our patient was diagnosed preoperatively with perforated hollow viscus and an exploratory laparotomy was indicated. Intraoperatively, a perforated MD was found and treated by surgical excision of the affected loop of bowel with end-to-end anastomosis and the specimens were sent for histopathological analysis. Histopathology revealed a perforated MD containing gastric mucosa. The patient had successful recovery. Early recognition with swift surgical intervention must take place to provide therapeutic outcome for patients and to limit the resulting morbidity. This case highlights the necessity of considering MD as core differential diagnosis in patients with acute abdomen. Due to the scarcity of data on perforated MDs in adult females, it's worthy of studying to highlight its incidence. Due to the rarity of a perforated MD in an adult female, it's worthy to consider such cases to explore preoperative assessment techniques, surgical interventions options, and postoperative complications."

We present a case of a 41-year-old para 4 + 1 who had acute abdomen and hypovolaemic shock secondary to haemoperitoneum at three months postpartum period. The urine pregnancy test was positive, and, therefore, a provisional diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was made. She was managed aggressively with fluids and blood product transfusion at the emergency department to achieve haemodynamic stability. Subsequently, she underwent an emergency laparotomy where intraoperatively noted a perforation at the left posterior uterine cornu with purplish tissue spillage. A wedge resection was performed, and the histopathological examination (HPE) was reported as atypical trophoblastic cells, in which choriocarcinoma could not be ruled out. The patient then underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy three weeks later. The final HPE confirmed the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the incidence of positive findings on CT chest in patients presenting with acute abdomen, who underwent CT thorax as part of the Intercollegiate General Surgical Guidance on COVID-19 during the first wave. To correlate CT chest findings with confirmed cases on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and to determine its influence on surgical management of abdominal emergencies. Methods A retrospective observational study of adult emergency surgical referrals (excluding trauma) for acute abdomen over a 10-week period was performed. COVID-19 changes on CT chest were categorized as per the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) CT reporting criteria. Patient demographics, COVID-19 RT-PCR, management and outcome were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA) with p-value significant at ≤0.05. Results Of the 160 patients included, 111 (69.38%) had COVID-19 RT-PCR. Twenty-four patients had CT chest findings suggestive of COVID-19. Amongst these, 45.83% demonstrated classic/probable CT features of COVID-19, of which 36.36% had positive RT-PCR. Most patients who had acute abdominal findings had a normal CT chest (p=0.03). Twenty-five (15.63%) patients presenting with abdominal pain had normal CT abdomen and seven (28%) of these had CT features of COVID-19. Only 43 (34.4%) patients needed a surgical intervention, of which 18.6% had COVID-19 changes on CT, confirmed by positive RT-PCR in 12.5%. Conclusion CT chest is an important investigation during the COVID-19 pandemic in suspected cases to help assess the severity of lung involvement. CT chest as an additional investigation modality in acute abdomen had clinically helped in triaging of patients to appropriate specialties but did not influence emergency surgical management."

Overall, ED admissions for the selected conditions decreased by 34.9% during the pandemic (control: 996, 2020: 648) and lower triage urgency codes were assigned for cholecystitis (control: 170/556, 2020: 66/356, p < 0.001) and appendicitis (control: 40/178, 2020: 21/157, p = 0.031). Less surgical procedures were performed in 2020 (control: 447, 2020: 309), but the surgical rate was stable (47.7% in 2020 vs. 44.8% in 2017-2019). Considering the clinical and pathological assessments, a higher percentage of severe cases was observed in the four pandemic peak months of 2020 (control: 98/192, 2020: 87/109; p < 0.001 and control: 105/192, 2020: 87/109; p < 0.001). For the first time in this study, pathological findings objectively demonstrated an increased disease severity of the analyzed conditions during the early COVID-19 pandemic."

    "title": "Idiopathic Megacolon-Short Review.",
    "abstract": "Idiopathic megacolon (IM) is a rare condition with a more or less known etiology, which involves management challenges, especially therapeutic, and both gastroenterology and surgery services. With insufficiently drawn out protocols, but with occasionally formidable complications, the condition management can be difficult for any general surgery team, either as a failure of drug therapy (in the context of a known case, initially managed by a gastroenterologist) or as a surgical emergency (in which the diagnostic surprise leads additional difficulties to the tactical decision), when the speed imposed by the severity of the case can lead to inadequate strategies, with possibly critical consequences. With such a motivation, and having available experience limited by the small number of cases (described by all medical teams concerned with this pathology), the revision of the literature with the update of management landmarks from the surgical perspective of the pathology appears as justified by this article. If the diagnosis of megacolon is made relatively easily by imaging the colorectal dilation (which is associated with initial and/or consecutive clinical aspects), the establishing of the diagnosis of idiopathic megacolon is based in practice almost exclusively on a principle of exclusion, and after evaluating the absence of some known causes that can lead to the occurrence of these anatomic and clinical changes, mimetically, clinically, and paraclinically, with IM (intramural aganglionosis, distal obstructions, intoxications, etc.). If the etiopathogenic theories, based on an increase in the performance of the arsenal of investigations of the disease, have registered a continuous improvement and an increase of objectivity, unfortunately, the curative surgical treatment options still revolve around the same resection techniques. Moreover, the possibility of developing a form of etiopathogenic treatment seems as remote as ever."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we report an unusual case of a closed-loop bowel obstruction secondary to a double gallstone ileus. This type of pathology constitutes an emergency, and requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent further complications. The patient was a 90-year-old female who came to our emergency room with a clinical picture compatible with an acute abdomen. Imaging tests performed included a plain radiograph and abdominal CT-scan, which confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was then transferred to the operating room, and an open double enterolithotomy was performed, extracting two cylindrical gallstones with a diameter of over 2.5 cm. No treatment was given for either the gallbladder nor the biliary-enteric fistula due to the patient's physical status. Gallstone ileus is a rare entity, but must be taken into consideration when a patient with an abdominal obstruction arrives to the emergency department, especially when signs such as pneumobilia or visualization of the stones are detected by imaging tests. Early surgical intervention is required to avoid complications. However, addressing the biliary-enteric fistula at the same time is a sensitive procedure that may not be advisable, depending on the status of the patient. This report includes a bibliographic review of existing cases of gallstone ileus and the specifics of its diagnosis and management. This pathology can lead to serious complications if not managed properly. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are essential to avoid complications such as intestinal gangrene and perforation. Inspecting the entire intestine during surgery is crucial for removing any additional gallstones that may be present to prevent the reappearance of symptoms."

    "abstract": "Acute gastric dilatation is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that may occur in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa after ingesting large amounts of food within a short period. Frequently, this condition is considered a surgical emergency due to subsequent occurrence of complications such as gastric necrosis or perforation.Here we report a case of a young female patient (23 years) with anorexia nervosa who presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and inability to vomit after a period of binge eating. Abdominal computed tomography revealed an extremely dilated stomach measuring 39.0 cm × 18.0 cm in size. Initial nasal decompression therapy using gastric tubes had failed. Due to the absence of complications, it was decided to treat her solely by endoscopic means under mechanical ventilation. After undergoing multiple overtube-assisted esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs), she fully recovered eventually.This case demonstrates that interventional endoscopic treatment of a patient with uncomplicated acute gastric dilatation is feasible and safe, at least under general anesthesia. Hence, this option should be considered when sole gastric tube suction fails, and there is no indication of complications such as peritonitis, sepsis, perforation, or gastric ischemia. A more invasive and aggressive surgical procedure may be avoided in selected cases, and the length of hospital stay may be shortened. Die akute Magendilatation ist ein seltenes, potenziell lebensbedrohliches Krankheitsbild, das bei Patienten mit Anorexia nervosa nach einer Fressattacke vorkommen kann. Genaue Angaben über Häufigkeiten fehlen. Bisher wird dieses Krankheitsbild v.a. wegen Komplikationen wie drohender Nekrose oder Perforation als chirurgische Notfallsituation angesehen.Wir berichten über den Fall einer jungen Frau (23 Jahre), die sich nach einer Bulimie-Attacke mit heftigsten abdominellen Schmerzen, Übelkeit und der Unmöglichkeit zu erbrechen notfallmäßig vorstellte. Die abdominelle Computertomografie zeigte einen massiv dilatierten Magen von 39 cm × 18 cm Größe, welcher die anderen Organe massiv verdrängte. Die Anlage einer dicklumigen Magensonde erbrachte keine relevante Besserung. Bei stabilen Kreislaufverhältnissen entschieden wir uns, nach Rücksprache mit der Viszeralchirurgie, für eine interventionelle endoskopische Therapie unter Beatmung mithilfe eines Übertubus. Nach mehreren Ösophagogastroduodenoskopien, während der Essensreste und Flüssigkeit entfernt wurden, bildete sich die Magendilatation zurück und die Patientin genas im weiteren Verlauf vollständig, sodass eine chirurgische Intervention vermieden werden konnte."

    "abstract": "India is considered the diabetes capital of the world and has the highest burden of mucormycosis. Bacterial, viral and fungal co-infections are increasingly being reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infected patients. India is one of the worst affected countries during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This combination of diabetes mellitus, COVID-19 and mucormycosis has led to the drastic upsurge of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) in India. Immunosuppression, iron disequilibrium, endothelial injury, ketoacidosis and hypoxia are some of the other COVID-19-related risk factors for CAM. There has been an increase in the proportion of mucormycosis affecting paranasal sinuses and central nervous system (CNS) in CAM compared to pre-COVID-19 literature due to the SARSCoV-2-related pathophysiological mechanisms, complications and treatment strategies. CAM is a medical and surgical emergency, and it can present with non-specific symptoms and signs initially resulting in diagnostic delay. High index of suspicion and regular screening for features of CAM are of paramount importance to prevent lethal consequences. Rapid action with a tripod approach consisting of withdrawal of immunomodulators, early antifungal therapy and extensive surgical debridement is considered the best possible treatment model. We review the published data to give a detailed account of the predisposing factors and their mechanisms, diagnostic work-up, treatment modalities and prevention strategies of CAM with special emphasis on CNS mucormycosis."

    "abstract": "Infections of the hand and forearm are a frequently seen surgical emergency of the hand. Patients of all age groups are affected and underlying systemic diseases are risk factors. Posttraumatic causes are the leading cause of infections. This includes cuts and stab wounds, animal and human bites but often also minor injuries. Due to the anatomical peculiarities of the hand, rapid progression of initially inconspicuous infections can occur resulting in functional limitations. If an infection is suspected, a symptom-oriented evaluation by a hand surgeon should be performed. This includes a detailed patient history, clinical examination, laboratory analyses and imaging. This is followed by the development of an individualized and interdisciplinary treatment concept with the aim of achieving the shortest possible rehabilitation period. The treatment includes surgical cleansing of the infection, accompanied by antibiotic treatment taking the expected possible spectrum of pathogens into account. Cephalosporins and aminopenicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors are the antibiotics of first choice. Follow-up treatment includes early functional exercise under the guidance of a hand therapist to minimize postinfectious restrictions in the range of motion and to enable occupational rehabilitation. In rare cases, fulminant necrotizing infections with resulting skin and soft tissue defects can occur. In these cases, secondary plastic reconstruction is usually required after cleansing of the infection. Infektionen der Hand und des Unterarms sind häufig gesehene handchirurgische Notfälle. Betroffen sind Patient*innen aller Altersgruppen, wobei systemische Grunderkrankungen als Risikofaktoren für die Entstehung zählen. Posttraumatische Ursachen stellen den führenden Grund für Infektion dar. Dies schließt Schnitt- und Stichwunden, Tier- und Menschenbiss-, aber häufig auch Bagatellverletzungen ein. Aufgrund anatomischer Besonderheiten der Hand kann es zu einer raschen Progression von zunächst unscheinbaren Infektionen kommen, mit daraus resultierenden funktionellen Einschränkungen. Bei Verdacht auf eine Infektion sollte eine symptomorientierte Abklärung durch einen handchirurgischen Facharzt erfolgen. Diese umfasst eine ausführliche Anamnese, klinische Untersuchung, Labordiagnostik und bildgebende Untersuchung. Anschließend erfolgt die Erarbeitung eines individualisierten und interdisziplinären Behandlungskonzepts mit dem Ziel einer möglichst kurzen Rehabilitationszeit. Die Therapie umfasst die chirurgische Infektsanierung, begleitend sollte eine antibiotische Therapie unter Beachtung des zu erwartenden Erregerspektrum eingeleitet werden. Cephalosporine und Aminopenicilline in Kombination mit β‑Lactamase-Hemmern stellen die Antibiotika der ersten Wahl dar. Die Nachbehandlung umfasst die frühfunktionelle Beübung unter handtherapeutischer Anleitung, um postinfektiöse Einschränkungen auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren und eine zeitnahe berufliche Rehabilitation zu ermöglichen. In seltenen Fällen werden fulminante nekrotisierende Infektionen mit daraus resultierenden Hautweichteildefekten beschrieben; hier bedarf es nach Sanierung des Infekts meist einer sekundären plastischen Rekonstruktion."

    "abstract": "Background: Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency that needs prompt diagnosis and treatment. Point-of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) can not only establish the diagnosis but also guide the Emergency Physician in evaluating the response to manual detorsion. Case Report: We describe the case of a 13-year-old male who presented with acute scrotal pain. We demonstrate how bedside ultrasound was used to make the diagnosis of testicular torsion, guide the technique for manual detorsion, and confirm adequate return of blood flow. Our case illustrates the ease with which POCUS can be used in real time to diagnose and treat organ-threatening pathology, but more importantly, it shows how real-time POCUS was used to detorse a testicle that was refractory to the standard detorsion technique. Conclusion: The acute scrotum is a time-sensitive presentation and if testicular torsion is present, the diagnosis should be made as soon as possible. Many Emergency Departments do not have 24-hour coverage of ultrasound technicians, which would delay the diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, when manual detorsion is attempted, it often does not work because the testicle may need more than the standard 180 degree medial to lateral rotation. POCUS provides real-time analysis of return of blood flow and can thus guide further rotation, or opposite direction rotation, as needed."

    "abstract": "Diagnosing a ureteral colic is sometimes difficult; however, clinicians should not fail to detect a surgical emergency. This is why diagnostic strategies depend on the imaging examinations, especially ultrasound. Prior studies have investigated the accuracy of Point of Care Ultrasound (PoCUS), but there are relatively few. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the PoCUS in the diagnosis of renal colic. The secondary objective was to evaluate the relationship between the imaging results and the treatment performed. After the clinical evaluation of patients aged > 18 years with suspected ureteral colic, the Emergency Physician (EP) trained in ultrasound performed PoCUS to conclude whether a diagnosis of \"renal colic\" should be made. A computed tomography (CT) examination was subsequently performed, to determine whether ureteral or bladder lithiasis was present to diagnose a ureteral colic. The patient's management was decided according to the to degree of urinary tract dilatation, presence of perinephric fluid, size, and localization of stones. Of the 12 Eps in our units, seven met the training criteria for the inclusion of patients. A total of 103 patients were analyzed, and the renal colic diagnosis was retained in 85 cases after the CT examination. The accuracy of PoCUS was 91% (86; 95%) for detecting urinary tract dilatation, 83% (76; 90%) for detecting perinephric fluid, and 54% (44; 64%) for detecting lithiasis. Only high urinary tract stones with ≥ 6 mm diameter were surgically managed (p < 0.01). Conversely, distal ureteral stones with a diameter of < 6 mm were managed with medical ambulatory treatment (p < 0.05). PoCUS is a good diagnostic tool, for renal colic, and could help reduce the requirement for the CT examinations and, hence, reduce induced radiation exposure."

    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome in the lower limb, a surgical emergency, may cause ischemic damage to muscles and neurological deficits leading to loss of function of the limb which may even require amputation, thus drastically affecting the quality of life of a patient. Fasciotomy for decompression is suggested when the differential pressure in the compartment of the leg is ≤30 mm Hg. However, compartment pressure measurement is not always feasible. Surgeons often find themselves in a dilemma in deciding the right treatment option for the patient: fasciotomy or conservative management. Since there is no universally accepted reference standard for the diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome at present, there is a need for definitive diagnostic variables so as to not delay fasciotomy in patients who need it, as well as to avoid unnecessary fasciotomies, especially when compartment pressures cannot be measured. In this observational study including 71 patients, based on the compartment pressures of the affected limb, treatment was done either with fasciotomy or conservative approach, and various clinical and biochemical parameters were evaluated in between these two groups. Statistically significant difference was found in the venous blood gas parameters between patients managed conservatively and with fasciotomy (MANOVA, P = .001). The results revealed the association of lower venous blood bicarbonate levels (independent sample t test, P = .021) and the presence of paresthesia (Fisher exact test, P = .0016) with the fasciotomy group. Also, pain on passive stretching of the affected limb was found to be significantly associated with a delta pressure of ≤30 mm Hg in any compartment (Fisher exact test, P = .002). These variables may thus be used as an alternative to the measurement of compartment pressure to assess the requirement of fasciotomy."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction is a common and dangerous surgical emergency which is associated with high morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately and timely. To determine the causes and management outcome of small bowel obstruction in Nekemte Referral Hospital, Nekemte, Ethiopia. Institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study design was used. Three-year data (from January 1, 2014, to December 30, 2016) were collected from July 1 to August 30, 2017. Data were collected from medical records and checked for any inconsistency, coded, and entered into SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive, binary, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used. On binary logistic regression analysis, variables with p ≤ 0.25 were selected as a candidate for multivariate logistic regression analysis. The level of statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. With 100% response rate, records of 211 patients with small intestinal obstruction were retrieved for analysis. One hundred thirty-seven (64.9%) were males. The commonest cause of small bowel obstruction was adhesion (35.1%). More than a quarter (26.5%) participants developed postoperative complications, and wound infection was the commonest postoperative complication (49.2%). A majority (84.8%) of patients improved and were discharged, and the rest 15.2% of patients died. Sex (AOR = 3.98, 95% CI: 1.51-10.52), duration of illness before surgical intervention (AOR = 4.4, 95% CI: 1.69-11.45), level of hematocrit (AOR = 4.25, 95% CI: 1.56-11.57), types of intestinal obstruction (AOR = 3.73, 95% CI: 1.09-12.64), and length of hospital stay (AOR = 4.69, 95% CI: 1.82-12.07) were independent predictors of the management outcome of patients with small bowl obstruction. Small bowel obstruction is a commonly encountered surgical emergency. Adhesion, small bowel volvulus, and intussusception were the leading causes of small bowel obstruction, respectively."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Adnexal torsion is a gynecologic emergency that dictates immediate surgical intervention. Twisted ovarian cysts are rare in adolescents, but they can cause significant distress to patients. Idiopathic ovarian torsion is uncommon in adolescents and the incidence is reportedly higher in women aged 20 to 40 years. Most twisted cysts in adolescents are benign. In the past, oophorectomy was commonly performed for a torsed ovary, but currently there is a trend toward ovary preservation. The diagnosis of twisted ovarian cyst is based on pathognomonic symptoms and findings from a focused clinical examination and ultrasound. Because the differential diagnosis includes acute appendicitis and gastroenteritis, referral to a gynecologist may be delayed. CASE REPORT We present the case of a huge, twisted ovarian cyst in a 16-year-old girl who presented with an acute abdomen. The initial diagnosis was acute appendicitis, which delayed her referral to a gynecologist. An emergency laparotomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The histopathology of the ovarian cyst was reported as serous cystadenoma. CONCLUSIONS The optimal management of a twisted ovarian cyst in adolescents is the subject of much debate. Here, we review the literature on ovarian torsion in children and adolescents. The patient in the case we present had a twisted ovarian cyst that was managed with salpingo-oophorectomy."

Gastric outlet obstruction can progressively inflate the stomach and cause pneumatosis. Regarding abdominal signs and the presence of acute abdomen, management varies from just conservative to emergent surgical interventions. We introduce an adult patient who presented to our hospital with weakness and dyspnea. After initial measures, unexpectedly we found intraabdominal free gas, concurrent gastric pneumatosis, and aeroportia. Due to the absence of positive abdominal signs, the patient was treated successfully without any surgical or endoscopic interventions. Gastric outlet obstruction is a well-known cause of gastric pneumatosis. Progressive dilation of the stomach due to pyloric stenosis is well-described both in infants and adult populations. In stable patients, gastric drainage and correction of electrolyte disturbance are the only required treatment. However endoscopic and surgical interventions should be considered in unstable patients or those developing acute abdomen."

A total of 59 patients in standard care group and 61 patients in adapted ERAS group were included and randomized, and were comparable in terms of demographic and clinico-pathological characteristics. LOH in adapted ERAS group was shorter by 3 days (p < 0.001), and patients showed reduction in time (days) to first flatus (2.84 vs 4.22, p < 0.001), first stool (4.38 vs 6.08, p < 0.001) and solid diet (4.67 vs 8.37, p < 0.001). Post-operative nausea, vomiting (p = 0.05) and surgical site infections (p < 0.001) were reduced in adapted ERAS group. Pre-existing malignancy, respiratory complications and high output stoma were reasons for delayed discharge in adapted ERAS group. Adapted ERAS pathways considerably reduce LOH in patients undergoing emergency surgery for perforation peritonitis, with no adverse events in 30 days after discharge.

    "abstract": "Uterine torsion is a rare surgical emergency that can evolve with ischemic lesions of the genital organs. We present a case of a 59 year-old woman who was hospitalized with important abdominal pain and modified general status. On clinical examination, a giant abdominal mass was found, and bimanual genital palpation could not find the cervix but revealed tension in the vaginal walls. CT examination described the palpable tumor mass as a giant uterine leiomyoma, with no information regarding the adnexes. As her general status become critical within 24 hours, the surgical intervention was performed, although the patient refused it. The abdominal exploration discovered a giant engorged uterus with 720-degree dextro-isthmic rotation around its axis; both fallopian tubes, broad ligaments, round ligaments and ovaries were also rotated and ischemic. She underwent subtotal hysterectomy with favorable postoperative outcome. The pathological report showed that the uterus and the annexes had ischemic to necrotic lesions. This case shows that the diagnosis of uterine torsion can be a pitfall due to its rarity. The disease has fatal evolution if the correct treatment is not applied on time."

    "abstract": "Abdominal complications following cardiac surgery have high mortality rates. This study analyzes the outcomes of patients who have undergone emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures after cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) at the same hospitalization. This was a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent emergent abdominal surgery after CTS surgery between 2010-2018. The CTS procedures included coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement, cardiac transplant, aortic replacement, ventricular assist device, and pericardial procedures. The records were reviewed to obtain demographics, frequency distribution of EGS procedures, complications, outcomes, and the risk factors of mortality. Of 4826 patients who had CTS, 57 (1.2%) underwent EGS procedures during the period of 2010-2018. This cohort of patients had 113 CTS and 85 EGS procedures during the same hospitalization. The mean age was 62 years, and 49% were elderly (40% were females). CABG with or without valve replacement was the most common surgery (28%). After surgical consultation for \"acute abdomen\" in the post-CTS phase, the three most common findings on exploratory laparotomy were bowel perforation (23%), massive free fluid leading to abdominal compartment syndrome (19%), and acute cholecystitis (16%). Respiratory failure (46%), acute kidney injury (32%), and multiple organ dysfunction (18%) were the most common hospital-acquired complications. Regarding dispositions, 47% were discharged to an acute rehabilitation center, 10% were discharged to a sub-acute rehabilitation center, and a similar proportion of patients went home (10%). On multivariable logistic regression analysis with backward elimination, age (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18) and serum proteins (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.998) were independently associated with the odds of mortality after EGS in the immediate CTS phase. Respiratory failure is the most common complication of EGS immediately after CTS. The older the patient and the lower the serum proteins, the higher the odds of mortality in patients who undergo EGS after ETS."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation complicated by subphrenic abscess is a surgical emergency. Its diagnosis relies mainly on X-ray or computed tomography (CT), while the value of ultrasound, especially contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), has been underestimated. A 37-year-old man presented with fever and edema of the lower extremities for 10 d. He had a history of laparoscopic repair of gastroduodenal perforation 6 mo prior. His first-time intravenous CEUS indicated a diagnosis of subphrenic abscess. He received antibiotic therapy and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the abscess. However, second-time intravenous CEUS revealed an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Intracavitary CEUS was proposed, and this examination detected communication between the abscess and the stomach. Upper gastrointestinal perforation complicated by fistula formation and subphrenic abscess was diagnosed with the help of CEUS. Abdominal CT and esophagogastroduodenoscopy confirmed the diagnosis. The patient recovered after the perforation was repaired by surgery. Intravenous and intracavitary CEUS provides helpful information for the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal perforation complicated by fistula formation and subphrenic abscess."

Infection with Salmonella typhi, an enteric pathogen, is a rare cause of acute appendicitis. We here report a patient with acute appendicitis associated with Samonella typhi infection, accompanied with spleen and kidney infarction, providing a rare example for a common surgical emergency. A 25-year-old Pakistani man presented to the hospital with a 3-d history of fevers, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a thickened intestinal wall of the ileocecal junction with multiple enlarged lymph nodes nearby. He was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and received laparoscopic appendectomy, which showed mild inflammation of the appendix. After the surgery, the patient presented again with a high fever (> 39 °C) and diarrhea. A CT angiography scan indicated spleen and kidney infarction. According to the blood culture, the diagnosis was finally clear to be Samonella typhi infection. The pyrexia and enteric symptoms were relieved after the application of intravenous levofloxacin. This case, characterized by the combination of Salmonella typhi infection, acute appendicitis, and renal and splenic infraction, serves as a rare example for a common surgical emergency."

    "abstract": "Background: Acute mesenteric ischaemia (AMI) is a surgical emergency which has an associated high mortality.  The mainstay of active treatment includes early surgical intervention, with resection of non-viable bowel, and revascularisation of the ischaemic bowel where possible. Due to the physiological insult of AMI however, perioperative care often involves critical care and the use of vasoactive agents to optimise end organ perfusion. A number of these vasoactive agents are currently available with varied mechanism of action and effects on splanchnic blood flow. However, specific guidance on which is the optimal vasoactive drug to use in these settings is limited. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current evidence comparing vasoactive drugs in AMI. Methods: A systematic search of Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review was performed on the 5th of November 2020 to identify randomised clinical trials comparing different vasoactive agents in AMI on outcomes including mortality. The search was performed through the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSEng) search support library. Results were analysed using the Rayyan platform, and independently screened by four investigators. Results: 614 distinct papers were identified. After screening, there were no randomised clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria. Conclusions: This review identifies a gap in literature, and therefore recommends an investigation into current practice and clinician preference in relation to vasoactive agents in AMI. Multicentre randomised controlled trials comparing these medications on clinical outcomes will therefore be required to address this question."

Health care personnel were facing an unprecedented problem with limited information. On this background, we have reviewed the operational challenges faced and the protocols followed by us while managing emergency surgical patients. The clinical presentations, RT-PCR testing rates, trend of COVID-19 positivity in emergency surgical patients and its comparison to the general population, swab positivity among screen positive and negative patients, grade of COVID-19 affection, the outcomes in emergency surgical patients, and COVID-19 affection in treating personnel is studied. A protocol for triaging patients at presentation into screen positive or negative for COVID-19 was instituted. A proforma for all admitted patients over the period of March 2020 to August 2020 was maintained. A retrospective review of this data was carried out after Institutional Ethics Committee permission. A total of 222 patients presented to the surgical emergency, of which 110 required admission. Of the admitted patients, 28 were COVID-19 positive. The positivity amongst admitted and operated patients increased to 50% and 66.67%, respectively in August. The difference in mortality rate amongst the operated COVID-19 positive (11.1%) and negative (14.28%) patients was nonsignificant. None of the treating doctors had to be quarantined during this period. The number of COVID-19 positive patients rose serially over the study period. The outcome was not affected by the COVID-19 status in mild cases. A high rate of COVID-19 positivity was seen in patients requiring emergency surgery. Universal precautions ensured delivering treatment to emergency patients in standard time. Testing should continue for all as screening alone is not effective as the virus spreads into the population. Proper protocols helped us to protect the health care workers."

    "abstract": "Gastric volvulus is the abnormal gastric rotation upon itself. It carries a considerable risk for gastric strangulation which may lead to gangrene and perforation, which can be fatal. It commonly presents with non-specific and vague abdominal symptoms making prompt diagnosis and management imperative. This is a case report describing a case of acute organo-axial gastric volvulus. A 74-year-old female, with no comorbidities, presented to our department with non-specific abdominal symptoms. Gastric outlet obstruction was suspected. The patient was reviewed by the gastroenterologist and was offered an urgent upper endoscopy. The upper endoscopy findings described a gastric volvulus, and a Computed Tomography (CT) scan was done to confirm the diagnosis. The patient underwent exploratory/diagnostic laparoscopy and successful reduction and fixation followed. There was no evidence of tissue compromise or ischemia. The patient was discharged on post-operative day 4 following an unremarkable postoperative course. Acute gastric volvulus is a surgical emergency which can be associated with a high morbidity and mortality, if complications occur. The most important factor in diagnosing acute volvulus of the stomach is a high index of suspicion of the clinical symptoms and should be confirmed by imaging. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan is the preferred imaging modality. Urgent surgical intervention is needed to prevent potentially fatal complications. Acute Gastric Volvulus is rare and carries the risk of significant morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and treatment is required to prevent complications."

We present the case of a 43-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. A computed tomography of abdomen and pelvis showed a narrow, hypodense superior mesenteric artery after the origin, raising the possibility of thrombus or vasculitis. He was commenced on rivaroxaban and steroids. He subsequently presented with an acute abdomen in a collapsed state. Repeat imaging of his abdomen and pelvis revealed an ischaemic ileal segment and caecum. He required an emergency laparotomy with resection of the ischaemic segment and formation of a double-barrelled stoma. SAM is an important diagnosis for clinicians and radiologists to be aware of, given the risks of life-threatening haemorrhage and acute organ ischaemia. This is a commonly overlooked cause of abdominal pain, where an early diagnosis with lifestyle modifications may prevent disease progression and subsequent development of life-threatening complications."

    "title": "Vernix Caseosa Peritonitis as a Rare Cause of Acute Abdomen After Cesarean Section.",
    "abstract": "Although Vernix caseosa peritonitis (VCP) is a rare complication of cesarean section (CS). It possesses a high rate of morbidity and its exact underlying pathology is not fully understood yet. However, it is assumed that the leakage of amniotic fluid into the maternal abdominal cavity triggers the inflammatory process. We discussed herein a 25-year-old patient who developed acute peritonitis three days after cesarean section. CT abdomen showed multiple fluid collections with no obvious other pathologies. At laparotomy, we found cheesy exudates covering the peritoneal surface of the abdominal viscera and multiple turbid fluid collections, but no bowel, uterine, or any another organ injury could be identified. Abdominal washing was done and, as the appendix was queried, an appendectomy was added. Histopathology study of the omental biopsy revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate, fibrin, fetal hair, and squames. These findings suggest the diagnosis of VCP, but the removed appendix was normal. The postoperative course was long and complicated. A few cases of VCP were reported in the world; the majority of these cases are from the USA and a few are from the UK. According to the information we have, our case is the first reported case of VCP in Saudi Arabia. Typically, VCP is manifested as acute abdomen hours to weeks after CS or vaginal delivery. As VCP is usually mistaken for the other causes of acute peritonitis, and the diagnosis is only established by the histopathology examination of peritoneal or omental biopsies, the case is commonly managed by urgent laparotomy or laparoscopy with the removal of suspected organs, which are later confirmed to be normal on histopathology study. The typical intraoperative findings are adhesive exudate, white or cheese-like membranes covering the intraabdominal viscera, and fluid collections, but no visceral injuries can be identified. Therefore, it is crucial to include the VCP in the differential diagnosis of the acute abdomen after CS or vaginal delivery to avoid unnecessary laparotomy and removal of normal organs."

Occasionally these can present in the emergency as an acute abdomen. We report a rare presentation of a huge mesenteric cyst with gastric perforation, misdiagnosed clinically as obstructed inguinal hernia. A 50-year male presented with complaints of sudden severe pain in the abdomen along with swelling and pain in the right groin region with absolute constipation for the last 4 days. A clinical diagnosis of obstructed inguinal hernia was made. However, on radiological investigations, it was discovered as a giant intra-abdominal cyst herniating into the inguinal canal. On exploration, we were further surprised to find a concomitant gastric perforation. In this case report, we highlight that mesenteric cysts can present as acute abdomen and, very rarely, can be associated with an accompanying cause of surgical abdomen."

The purpose of the study was to describe the demography, clinical features, diagnostic and treatment modalities, and prognosis of adnexal torsion cases. Methods Surgically proven adnexal torsion case records were retrieved and data were entered in an excel sheet from a period of two and half years from January 2018 to June 2020. Results There were 28 cases with an age range of 7-85 years (median age 24 years) with lower abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting symptoms. The majority were in the reproductive age group (71.4%). A Colour Doppler was done which detected 75% (12/16) of the ovarian torsion cases. The size of the adnexal torsion was 5-10 cm in 60.7% with right-sided torsion seen in 57.14%. Detorsion and salpingo-oophorectomy was done in 14 (50%) and 11 (39.2%) cases, respectively. Histopathological examination revealed hemorrhagic/necrotic infarcts (54.2%) and dermoid cysts (33.3%). Conclusions Owing to non-specific symptoms, adnexal torsion is diagnosed with strong clinical suspicion as routine ultrasonography diagnosed only 7.1% in the present study. Conservative surgery is preferred in the reproductive age group."

We have demonstrated the efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr) in protecting against experimental NEC when administered as a biofilm by incubation with maltose loaded dextranomer microspheres. Lr possesses antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. We developed mutant strains of Lr to examine the importance of its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in protecting the intestines from NEC. Premature rat pups were exposed to hypoxia/hypothermia/hypertonic feeds to induce NEC. To examine the importance of antimicrobial reuterin and anti-inflammatory histamine, pups received either native or mutant forms of Lr, in either its planktonic or biofilm states, prior to induction of NEC. Intestinal histology was examined upon sacrifice. Compared to no treatment, administration of a single dose of Lr in its biofilm state significantly decreased the incidence of NEC (67% vs. 18%, p < 0.0001), whereas Lr in its planktonic state had no significant effect. Administration of reuterin-deficient or histamine-deficient forms of Lr, in either planktonic or biofilm states, resulted in significant loss of efficacy. Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of Lr contribute to its beneficial effects against NEC. This suggests that both infectious and inflammatory components contribute to the etiology of NEC."

    "abstract": "Failure to rescue (FTR) denotes mortality from post-operative complications after surgery with curative intent. High-volume, low-mortality units have similar complication rates to others, but have lower FTR rates. Effective response to the deteriorating post-operative patient is therefore critical to reducing surgical mortality. Resilience Engineering might afford a useful perspective for studying how the management of deterioration usually succeeds and how resilience can be strengthened. We studied the response to the deteriorating patient following emergency abdominal surgery in a large surgical emergency unit, using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). FRAM focuses on the conflicts and trade-offs inherent in the process of response, and how staff adapt to them, rather than on identifying and eliminating error. 31 semi-structured interviews and two workshops were used to construct a model of the response system from which conclusions could be drawn about possible ways to strengthen system resilience. The model identified 23 functions, grouped into five clusters, and their respective variability. The FRAM analysis highlighted trade-offs and conflicts which affected decisions over timing, as well as strategies used by staff to cope with these underlying tensions. Suggestions for improving system resilience centred on improving team communication, organisational learning and relationships, rather than identifying and fixing specific system faults. FRAM can be used for analysing surgical work systems in order to identify recommendations focused on strengthening organisational resilience. Its potential value should be explored by empirical evaluation of its use in systems improvement."

    "title": "Evaluating Acute Testicular Pain Using Point-of-Care Hand-Held Doppler in the Emergency Department: A Prospective Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Testicular pain is one of the common conditions in patients visiting the emergency department. The causes of acute testicular pain vary from non-urgent inflammatory conditions like epididymo-orchitis to testicular torsion which is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis of testicular torsion with early initiation of appropriate surgical intervention helps in salvaging the testes. There is a need for a simple, rapid bedside diagnostic tool for the evaluation and triaging of subjects with acute testicular pain in the emergency department. The aim of this study is to determine whether hand-held Doppler (HHD) examination by the emergency department (ED) physician can safely rule out testicular torsion in a case of acute testicular pain. Materials and Methods A prospective pilot study was conducted in the emergency department of Alkhor Hospital, Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar. The subjects between 18 to 50 years of age who presented to the ED with testicular pain were included. Subjects with recent trauma to the scrotum, or recent genitourinary surgery and those who had pain for more than 48 hours were excluded. Point-of-care HHD was done by a single ED physician who was blinded for the Doppler study results done by the radiologist. The results of the HHD performed by the ED physician and Doppler study performed by the radiologist were compared and analyzed. Results  Forty-five patients were included in the study. The mean age was 28 years and the mean duration of pain was 20 hours. HHD ruled out testicular torsion in 44 subjects with a specificity of 97.8%. In one subject, HHD was reported as torsion testis which was ruled out by the radiologist. The radiologist Doppler ruled out torsion in all 45 subjects. Conclusion The diagnostic performance of HHD by the ED physicians was almost equal to that of radiologists in ruling out testicular torsion. HHD can be used as a first-line triaging tool by the ED physician to rule out torsion of testis in patients presenting with acute testicular pain. We conclude that patients with testicular pain with a negative HHD for torsion testis can be safely discharged from the emergency department."

    "abstract": "Accurate interpretation of computed tomography (CT) scans is critical for patient care in the emergency department. We aimed to identify factors associated with an incorrect interpretation of abdominal CT by novice emergency residents and to analyze the characteristics of incorrectly interpreted scans. This retrospective analysis of a prospective observational cohort was conducted at three urban emergency departments. Discrepancies between the interpretations by postgraduate year-1 (PGY-1) emergency residents and the final radiologists' reports were assessed by independent adjudicators. Potential factors associated with incorrect interpretation included patient age, sex, time of interpretation, and organ category. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for incorrect interpretation were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Among 1,628 eligible cases, 270 (16.6%) were incorrect. The urinary system was the most correctly interpreted organ system (95.8%, 365/381), while the biliary tract was the most incorrectly interpreted (28.4%, 48/169). Normal CT images showed high false-positive rates of incorrect interpretation (28.2%, 96/340). Organ category was found to be a major determinant of incorrect interpretation. Using the urinary system as a reference, the aOR for incorrect interpretation of biliary tract disease was 9.20 (95% confidence interval, 5.0-16.90) and the aOR for incorrectly interpreting normal CT images was 8.47 (95% confidence interval, 4.85-14.78). Biliary tract disease is a major factor associated with incorrect preliminary interpretations of abdominal CT scans by PGY-1 emergency residents. PGY-1 residents also showed high false-positive interpretation rates for normal CT images. Emergency residents' training should focus on these two areas to improve abdominal CT interpretation accuracy."

    "abstract": "Surgical site infection after emergency hand surgery can cause considerable morbidity and, in the most severe forms, even toxic shock syndrome. Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis aims to reduce the number of surgical site infections. However, excessive use of antibiotics induces side-effects for patients and antibiotic resistance for society. Contrary to other orthopedic sites, there is no consensus on postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in open hand trauma beyond analogic reasoning with no proven scientific validity. Our hypothesis was that absence of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis after open hand trauma surgery does not affect the rate of surgical site infections. A prospective cohort study included 405 patients, operated on in the emergency hand trauma unit without intra- or post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. Patients were followed up in consultation at 7, 14 and 30 days. Surgical site infection was defined by need for surgery for detersion and flattening, followed by curative antibiotic therapy. The surgical site infection rate was 2.22%. Four patients were lost to follow-up and counted as surgical site infection as originally planned in the worst-case analysis. There were five surgical revisions followed by antibiotic therapy. These results do not differ from those reported in the literature, and thus confirm our hypothesis that postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated in open hand trauma management."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a surgical emergency for which delays in treatment have been closely associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although the duration of ischemia as a determinant of outcomes for AMI is well known, the objective of this study was to identify hospital-based determinants of delayed revascularization and their effects on postoperative morbidity and mortality in AMI. All patients who underwent any surgery for AMI from a multi-center hospital system between 2010 and 2020 were divided into two groups based on timeliness of mesenteric revascularization after presentation. Early revascularization (ER) was defined as having both vascular consultation ≤12 hours of presentation and vascular surgery performed at the patient's initial operation. Delayed revascularization (DR) was defined as having either delays to vascular consultation or vascular surgery. A retrospective review of demographic and postoperative data was performed. The effect of DR on major postoperative outcomes, including 30-day and 2-year mortality, total length of bowel resection, and development of short bowel syndrome, were analyzed. Effects of delayed vascular consultation alone, delayed vascular surgery alone, no revascularization during admission, and admitting service on outcomes were also examined on subgroup analyses. A total of 212 patients were analyzed. Ninety-nine patients received ER, whereas the remaining 113 patients experienced a DR after hospital presentation. Among the DR group, 55 patients (25.9%) had delayed vascular consultation, whereas vascular surgery was deferred until after the initial operation in 37 patients (17.4%). Fifty-one patients (24.0%) were never revascularized during admission. DR was a significant predictor of 30-day (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.9; P = .03) and 2-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.55, 95% CI, 1.0-2.3; P = .04). DR was also independently associated with increased bowel resection length (OR, 7.47; P < .01) and postoperative short bowel syndrome (OR, 2.4; P = .03) on multivariate analyses. When examined separately on subgroup analysis, both delayed vascular consultation (OR, 3.38; P = .03) and vascular surgery (OR, 4.31; P < .01) independently increased risk of 30-day mortality. Hospital discharge after AMI without mesenteric revascularization was associated with increased risk of short bowel syndrome (OR, 2.94; P < .01) and late mortality (hazard ratio, 1.60; P = .04). Delayed vascular consultation and vascular surgery are both significant hospital-based determinants of postoperative mortality and short bowel syndrome in patients with AMI. Timing-based management protocols that emphasize routine evaluation by a vascular surgeon and early, definitive mesenteric revascularization should be established and widely adopted for all patients with clinically suspected AMI at presentation."

This paper aimed to present a case of \"epiploic appendagitis of the appendix\", which is a rare cause of right lower quadrant pain. A 45-year-old male patient with abdominal pain was referred to the radiology clinic for abdominal CT. The pain localized to the right lower quadrant and no signs of peritoneal irritation were present on physical examination. On images of abdominal CT the diameter of the appendix measured as 7 mm. The wall thickness was within normal limits and no mucosal enhancement noted. Appendiceal air was present in the lumen. An oval lesion of fat density with a hyperdense rim was seen adjacent to the anterior part of the appendix. It was causing striations and heterogeneous appearance in the surrounding mesenteric fat tissue with central areas of high attenuation. The findings noted down as \"hyper-attenuating ring sign\" and \"central dot sign\". These pathognomonic CT findings were consistent with epiploic appendagitis and the case reported as epiploic appendagitis of the appendix. After conservative non-surgical medical treatment symptoms of patient revealed. To prevent unnecessary surgery, it is important to exclude conditions requiring emergency surgical intervention with imaging. The most effective technique recommended for imaging is CT with IV opaque. Increasing awareness and knowledge of radiologists regarding epiploic appendagitis of the appendix will rule out the possibility of potential misdiagnosis in imaging and will avoid the resultant unnecessary surgery."

    "title": "Reinforced Aortic Root Reconstruction in Type A Aortic Dissection: A Prospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection is a challenging surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Many techniques have evolved to repair the dissected sinus segments and restore aortic valve dynamics. Herein, we evaluate the early outcome of a novel technique for reconstruction of dissected aortic root. A prospective study was conducted on 300 patients to evaluate the early results of repair of dissected root in type A aortic dissection. The mean age was 59.65±8.52 years, and 76% of patients were males. All patients had four standard steps for aortic reconstruction: 1) commissural resuspension; 2) right coronary sinus reinforcement with pericardial and Dacron bands; 3) non-coronary sinus reinforcement using external Dacron patch; 4) circumferential inversion of adventitial layer of the root. Patients were followed up clinically, echocardiographically, and by CT scan. The in-hospital mortality was 8%. The mean cross-clamp time was 120±30 minutes, and circulatory arrest time was 25+10 minutes. Twenty-seven patients (9%) experienced postoperative complications, including bleeding and acute kidney injury. During a mean follow-up time of 48±12 months, there were no recurrent aortic dissection, aortic dilatation, pseudoaneurysm, or progression of aortic regurgitation during the entire study period. This reconstructive technique technically is undemanding, feasible, safe, and durable with good early results. A larger cohort of patients with longer period of follow up should generate a more powerful evaluation of this technique."

    "abstract": "With 2% prevalence worldwide, Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the small intestine, which anatomically results from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct. It is usually difficult to differentiate clinically between acute appendicitis and Meckel's diverticulitis, thus in most clinical situations, it is asymptomatic and usually incidentally discovered intraoperatively. On the other hand, Acute appendicitis is one of the most common presentations in a surgical emergency with an 8.6% incidence in males and 6.7% in females. Triple presentation of acute appendicitis, Meckel's diverticulum, and a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst is a rare incidence in literature. A female patient 35 years old with no previous surgical history or known medical disease presented to our ER with right lower quadrant abdominal pain of one-day duration. On physical examination; there was right iliac fossa pain, tenderness, and rebound tenderness indicating acute appendicitis. Intraoperatively we operated appendectomy as usual through Gridiron incision. Upon opening of the parietal peritoneum, there was a hemorrhagic reaction with a catarrhal inflamed appendix. Ileal loops revealed a Meckel's diverticulum. With the peritoneal toilet, there was still a hemorrhagic reaction. Further exploration revealed a ruptured hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, which was managed using bipolar cautery and ligatures. In the operative management of acute appendicitis, we recommend proper assessment for both the right ovary and at least two feet of ileum proximal to the ileocecal valve to exclude any ovarian abnormalities or Meckel's diverticulum respectively especially if the appendix was normal or just was catarrhal inflamed."

    "abstract": "Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare anatomical variation of the thoracic and abdominal organs. It is a congenital anomaly with an incidence of 1:10,000 to 1:20,000. Patients with SIT do not have a decreased survival rate as compared to patients without SIT because SIT generally does not have a pathophysiologic significance. However, the anatomical variations in SIT can cause some challenges when assessing intraabdominal and intrathoracic symptoms or performing operations. We report a case of a 93-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and situs inversus totalis who presented with diffuse abdominal pain for 4 days. Abdominal exam was significant for diffuse tenderness. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was significant for pneumoperitoneum. She emergently underwent an exploratory laparotomy, descending hemicolectomy and left in discontinuity with an open abdomen. On postoperative day 2 she underwent a stamm feeding gastrostomy tube, incisional hernia repair, and maturation of end colostomy. Her remaining hospital course was complicated by a pelvic collection, which was managed by a percutaneous guided drain placement. She was ultimately discharge to rehab on hospital day 15. SITS can present a particularly challenging situation to clinical diagnoses and surgical procedures. However, when identified, these patients should warrant special considerations prior to proceeding with surgical intervention. This includes radiologic imaging and proper planning prior to the operating room, when possible. We herein present a case of colonic perforation in a patient with situs inversus totalis. Proper planning, thorough imaging, and careful execution are necessary to ensure patient safety and care in patients with SIT. However, in the case of emergency this should not delay definitive management."

    "abstract": "Feasibility and safety of ambulance transport between healthcare facilities with medical support exclusively via telemedicine are unknown. This was a retrospective study with a single telemedicine center reference for satellite emergency departments of the same hospital. The study population was all critically ill patients admitted to one of the peripheral units from November 2016 to May 2020 and who needed to be transferred to the main building. Telemedicine-assisted transportation was performed by an emergency specialist. The inclusion criteria included patients above the age of 15 and initial stabilization performed at the emergency department. Unstable, intubated, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and acute stroke patients were excluded. There was a double-check of safety conditions by the nurse and the remote doctor before the ambulance departure. The primary endpoint was the number of telemedicine-guided interventions during transport. 2840 patients were enrolled. The population was predominantly male (53.2%) with a median age of 60 years. Sepsis was the most prevalent diagnosis in 28% of patients, followed by acute coronary syndromes (8.5%), arrhythmia (6.7%), venous thromboembolism (6.1%), stroke (6.1%), acute abdomen (3.6%), respiratory distress (3.3%), and heart failure (2.5%). Only 22 (0.8%) patients required telemedicine-assisted support during transport. Administration of oxygen therapy and analgesics were the most common recommendations made by telemedicine emergency physicians. There were no communication problems in the telemedicine-assisted group. Telemedicine-assisted ambulance transportation between healthcare facilities of stabilized critically ill patients may be an option instead of an onboard physician. The frequency of clinical support requests by telemedicine is minimal, and most evaluations are of low complexity and easily and safely performed by trained nurses."

    "abstract": "Isolated fallopian tube torsion (IFTT) is a rare cause of gynecological acute abdomen, is easily misdiagnosed and often has a delay in diagnosis. IFTT with paraovarian cysts is most frequently reported in studies. Here, we reported a patient diagnosed with IFTT associated with a paraovarian cyst, and we conducted a literature review for IFTT, aiming to identify valuable information that will be helpful for diagnosis and treatment for fallopian tube torsions. A 13-year-old girl presented with a 10-day history of right lower abdominal pain that worsened 2 days before presentation. On presentation, ultrasound showed a 5.8 * 5.5 cm hypoechoic cyst adjacent to the right ovary, and between the cyst and ovary, a tortuous thickened tube was visualized. Laparoscopy revealed a triple torsion of the right fallopian tube with a 6-cm paraovarian cyst, and tubal conservation surgery was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histopathological diagnosis revealed serous papillary cystadenoma. Paraovarian cystic dilatation often occurs in adolescence and can induce fallopian torsion when the size of the cyst reaches 5-cm. In our review, the median age of patients diagnosed with IFTT with paraovarian cysts was 15 years old, and the main clinical manifestation was emergency abdominal pain. The associated symptoms were variable, and vomiting was the most commonly associated symptom. Salpingectomy was the most common procedure performed; however, timely surgical intervention can effectively avoid salpingectomy."

    "abstract": "to evaluate risk factors, causes, management and surgical therapy of postcoital vaginal perforation and evisceration in women with no prior pelvic surgery. We used MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Embase and Web of Science for our research. Our review includes all reports from 1980 to November 2020. The research strategy adopted included different combinations of the following terms: (intercourse) AND (coitus) AND (vaginal perforation). we report a case of vaginal evisceration after consensual intercourse in a young and healthy woman. In addition, we performed a systematic review of vaginal perforations with or without evisceration in women without prior surgery or any other predisposing disease. All studies identified were listed by citation, title, authors and abstract. Duplicates were identified by an independent manual screening, performed by one researcher and then removed. For the eligibility process, two authors independently screened the title and abstracts of all non-duplicated papers and excluded those not pertinent to the topic. We have followed the PRISMA guidelines. Five manuscripts were detected through the references of the works that had been identified with the research on MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Embase and Web of Science. We found 16 cases between 1980 and 2020. The young age and the virginal status represent the principal risk factors and all the lacerations occurred in the posterior vaginal fornix. The most common surgical technique was the laparotomic approach and, in the remaining cases, the laparoscopic and vaginal route was performed. Post-coital vaginal perforation and evisceration in women with no prior pelvic surgery is a rare condition in the clinical practice and, when it is associated with evisceration it is a surgical emergency. Usually, these injuries are not life-threatening conditions but, a delay in diagnosis, can lead to severe complications. In consideration of the high heterogeneity of the data in the literature, it is essential to define a diagnostic-therapeutic management for the patients with vaginal perforation. With our review, we try to identify the associated risk factors, the best and fastest diagnosis, and the best surgical approach. We believe that a combined vaginal and laparoscopic approach can be the best surgical treatment, useful to diagnose injuries of the abdominal organs and to improve postoperative outcome."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion, the twisting of the testis or spermatic cord, places the testis at risk of vascular compromise and is a surgical emergency. Testicular torsion is predominantly unilateral (98% of torsion cases) and primarily affects neonates and adolescents in a bimodal distribution. Bilateral testicular torsion is exceedingly rare (2% of cases) and is associated with neonates. To the authors' best knowledge, there have been no reports of bilateral torsion in adult males over the age of 24. A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency department 9 days after developing testicular pain while lifting his lawnmower. Ultrasonography performed at an outside facility was unremarkable. He was encouraged to followup with urology as an outpatient. Despite outpatient analgesia, he continued to experience pain and returned to the ED, where repeat ultrasonography demonstrated bilateral torsion with hypoperfusion. Although testicular torsion is uncommon, the clinician must recognize torsion; if left untreated, torsion leads to infertility. Previous publications suggest that ultrasonographic findings of bilateral testicular torsion should be attributed to \"technical failure\" rather than a plausible diagnosis. However, this case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion, especially with an atypical age range and pathological presentation, particularly among men during their reproductive years."

This study was conducted from 1st November 2018 to 31st March 2020 in ABVIMS &amp; Dr. R.M.L. Hospital, New Delhi. The potential candidates for the study were patients of 18 years and above who were admitted in surgical emergency and underwent emergency laparotomy by a midline incision. Fifty random patients were alternatively allotted to group A (25 patients) and group B (25 patients). In the patients of group A, closed incision negative pressure wound therapy (ciNPWT) was applied on midline closed wound after an exploratory laparotomy procedure. The patients in group B, standard dry gauze dressing was done. The mean age of patients in group A and group B were 46.76±12.20 and 41.96±8.33 years, respectively (p-value-0.11). The wound infection was present in 12% of cases in group A and 32% in group B, but when we calculate the p-value, it was found to be statistically non-significant (p-value-0.08). Similarly, seroma formation and wound dehiscence were found less in group A as compared to group B but not reached up to a statistically significant limit (p-value 0.55 and 0.38 respectively). The frequency of dressing change was 1-2 per week in 92% of cases in group A while it was 3-4 per week in 68% of cases in group B. The mean time of the frequency of dressing change was 1.24±0.72 per week and 4.28±1.90 per week in both the groups respectively (p-value &lt;0.001). There was no significant (p&gt;0.05) difference in the duration of hospital stay between group A (mean hospital stay 8.20±2.34 days) and group B (mean hospital stay 8.21±3.37 days). Closed incision negative pressure wound therapy has no advantages over conventional dressing in terms of post-operative complications and hospital stay. However, it reduces the frequency of dressing change significantly, which reduces the mental stress of the patient and the burden of changing daily dressing."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoid intestinalis is a rare disease reported in the literature affecting 0.03% of the population. It has a variety of causes and its manifestation may change widely. It usually presents as a marginal finding resulting from various gastrointestinal pathologies. In the acute complicated form of pneumatosis intestinalis, management is challenging for physicians and surgeons. We present a case of a 60-year-old patient who was admitted to our surgical department with a symptomatology suggestive of small bowel occlusion. Computed tomography demonstrated ileal volvulus associated with parietal signs suffering and pneumoperitoneum. An emergent exploratory laparoscopy followed by conversion was performed demonstrating segmental ileal pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to a small bowel volvulus due to an inflammatory appendix wrapping around the distal ileum. Further, detorsion, retrograde draining, and appendectomy were performed because there were no signs of necrosis and the appendix was pathological. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case is exceedingly rare in the literature, because it was featured by the ileal volvulus due to appendicitis.This case report emphasizes the importance of surgical procedures in the management of symptomatic pneumatosis intestinalis associated to an acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "The bowel is the most common site of extragenital endometriosis, with involvement of the locoregional sigmoid colon and anterior rectum seen most often. The clinical presentation varies depending on how soon patients seek medical care, thus requiring changes in management strategies. Endometriosis can cause a life-threatening surgical emergency with progressive obliteration of the bowel lumen leading to obstruction and late complications including toxic megacolon and transmural necrosis. We report the case of a 41-year-old woman presenting with an acute abdomen and complete large bowel obstruction complicated by sepsis and toxic megacolon. The patient underwent emergency total colectomy with ileostomy. Medical history was significant for chronic, vague, and episodic lower abdominal pain self-medicated with herbal tea and laxatives. Pathologic examination demonstrated colonic endometriosis within the bowel wall as the cause of obstruction, ischemia, and transmural necrosis. Although a rare clinical entity, this case highlights two important points. First, it demonstrates the value of performing proper and complete clinical work up to rule out or in all possible causes of colonic obstruction, including intestinal endometriosis. Second, it suggests a potential benefit of a formalized multidisciplinary approach, including surgery, in the management of medically unresponsive endometriosis. In conclusion, this case shows that endometriosis can cause life-threatening colonic obstruction in women of childbearing age. Prompt early intervention is warranted, particularly when obstruction is only partial and ischemia has not supervened, to conceivably prevent the development of a toxic megacolon requiring colectomy and avoid late complications."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous bladder rupture SBR is a rare condition and often missed diagnosis, especially after a nontraumatic vaginal delivery. A 34-year-old patient who had a nontraumatic vaginal delivery presented to the emergency room 7 days later with acute abdomen and anuria. Computed tomography showed free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. An intraperitoneal rupture of the bladder dome was detected, showing extravasation of contrast into the peritoneal cavity. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a perforation on the bladder dome that was sutured. SBR following vaginal delivery is an extremely rare condition. It represents a surgical emergency. Due to the low incidence and the presence of non-specific symptoms, diagnosis was usually delayed with an increased morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should consider this diagnosis in the presence of an acute abdominal pain associated to anuria or dysuria. We therefore recommend that the bladder be catheterized or drained before labour. SBR is a rare and life-threatening condition in post-partum. Abdominal pain with elevated serum creatinine should be suspicious of urinary bladder rupture."

The aims of this study were to establish patterns of ultrasound use, correlate ultrasound and intraoperative findings and determine the impact of ultrasound on admission-to-operation time in patients undergoing scrotal exploration for suspected torsion. All adult patients who underwent acute scrotal exploration for suspected torsion between 2007 and 2017 at Auckland City Hospital were included (n=316). Clinical notes were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Admission-to-operation time was compared between patients who had a formal ultrasound and those who did not. Ultrasound was performed in 153/316 (48.4%) patients. Ultrasound sensitivity and specificity for torsion was 97.8% and 52.9% respectively. Median admission-to-operation time was 106 minutes for patients who did not have an ultrasound and 225 minutes for those who did (excluding those with missed torsion on ultrasound) (p=<0.0001). Non-viable testicle was identified intraoperatively in 11/163 patients (6.7%) who did not have an ultrasound, and in 42/122 (34.4%) of those who did (excluding those with missed torsion on ultrasound) (p=<0.0001). Ultrasound is a sensitive test for testicular torsion but associated with an average two-hour delay to theatre and a higher rate of intraoperative finding of non-viable testicle in this centre."

Spontaneous splenic rupture caused by a metastatic deposit has been reported only as case reports.

A case of spontaneous splenic rupture in a 68-year-old male presenting with acute onset left shoulder pain, caused by metastatic pancreatic cancer to the spleen, is presented herein. During the investigation, the patient developed hypovolemic shock due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage, necessitating emergency splenectomy. The patient recovered well and was discharged from the hospital on the 8th postoperative day. Discussion. This study underlines the fact that the spleen is a rare site of metastasis, remaining mostly asymptomatic. However, it can nevertheless prove to be a life-threatening condition. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of splenic rupture due to metastasis still remains unknown, requiring further research. Emergency splenectomy remains the standard of care, and this clinical condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with acute abdomen and malignant neoplasm history."

    "abstract": "Esophageal injury is a rare but potentially lethal surgical emergency. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality because of mediastinal contamination and difficulty of access. Surgery in such septic patients exacts a heavy physiological price, mandating consideration of more conservative measures. We review our experience with transgastric drainage for esophageal perforation and high-risk anastomotic dehiscence. A select cohort of patients presenting with esophageal perforation, or complex anastomotic leaks, over 10 years were considered for transgastric drainage (TGD). A modified 36F chest drainage tube was inserted by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy technique, either endoscopically or at open surgery, and a negative pressure (-10 cmH2O) was applied until the leak had sealed. Endpoints include, length of stay, restoration of gastrointestinal tract continuity and mortality. Of 14 patients treated, 10 had perforations and 4 had complex anastomotic leaks. Ten patients had drainage alone, while 4 required concomitant operative intervention. The median duration of drain insertion for those treated with TGD alone was 19.5 days. Complete restoration of gastrointestinal tract continuity was achieved in all patients. There was no procedure-related morbidity or mortality. These results show that TGD is a safe and effective management strategy. We advocate its use alone or as an adjunct to operative treatment for esophageal perforation or anastomotic leaks. This is the first report of completely endoscopic TGD for esophageal perforation."

However, this relies on accurate intra-operative diagnosis of a normal appendix by the operating surgeon. This study aimed to compare surgeon's intra-operative assessment to final histological result acute appendicitis in paediatric and adult patients. All patients who underwent appendicectomy over a 14-year period in a general surgical department were identified using the prospective Lothian Surgical Audit system and pathology reports retrieved to identify final histological diagnosis. Open appendicectomy was selected to examine, as the routine practise at our institution is to remove a normal appendix at open appendicectomy. A total of 1035 open appendicectomies were performed for clinically suspected appendicitis. Sensitivity of intra-operative diagnosis of appendicitis with operating surgeon was high at 95.13% with no difference between trainee and consultant surgeon or between adult and paediatric cases. Specificity of intra-operative diagnosis was lower in the paediatric group (32.58%) than in the adult group (40.58%). Women had a higher rate of negative appendicectomy than men. The results of this study highlight some discordance between histological evidence of acute appendicitis and intra-operative impression. Therefore other clinical variables and not just macroscopic appearance alone should be used when deciding to perform appendicectomy."

Recently, their incidence has decreased due to the introduction of antibiotics; nevertheless, complications related to DNIs are often life-threatening. The purpose of this article is focused on the identification of predisposing factors of these complications, as well as on the development of a reliable therapeutic algorithm. Sixty patients with DNIs were enrolled from 2006 to 2019 for a retrospective study. The exclusion criteria for the present study were cellulitis, small abscesses responding to empiric or specific antibiotic therapy, or involvement of only one deep neck space. During the analysis, the following parameters of interest have been evaluated: gender, age, site of origin, pathways of spread, comorbidities, clinical features, bacteriology data, type of surgical approach required, complications, duration of hospitalization and mortality rate. On admission, microbial swab analysis was performed. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), iron deficiency anemia and the involvement of multiple spaces have been associated with a significantly higher risk of developing complications. Most of our patients had polymicrobial infections. All patients underwent surgical drainage. The complication rate had occurred in 56.6% of patients, while death in 18.3%. DNIs represent a medical and surgical emergency with potentially serious complications; thus, avoidance of diagnostic delay is mandatory. Our preliminary data suggest the importance of evaluating the extent of infections because the involvement of multiple spaces requires timely surgery due to the higher risk of complications and mortality."

The principle of treatment is restoration of perfusion to ischemic bowel and resection of any necrotic intestine. Surgery and endovascular intervention are two complementary approaches to mesenteric ischemia. Endovascular intervention is not an alternative to the surgical approach, but it has the potential to improve the prognosis of patients with AMI when judiciously combined with a surgical approach. Due to the need for emergent treatment of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia, the treatment strategy needs to be modified for each facility. This review aims to highlight cutting-edge studies and provide reasonable treatment strategies for patients with acute mesenteric ischemia based on available evidence."

Several tools have been used to identify PC needs in different clinical settings and patient groups. The primary objective was to determine the prevalence and associated characteristics of PC needs among cancer patients admitted to the surgical emergency center (SEC) of a large academic hospital in South Africa (SA). The association between PC needs and early death were explored as a secondary outcome. This was a cross-sectional observational study that included all patients with known malignancy admitted through the SEC for acute surgical emergencies.

A tertiary level, public, academic hospital in Cape Town, SA. One hundred and twelve admissions were included with a median age of 58 years. Fifty-two admissions (46.4%) were for metastatic patients and 60.7% were known with palliative treatment intent. The prevalence of SPICT- and SQ-defined PC needs was 46.4% and 54.7% respectively. Pain was the most prevalent presenting symptom and bowel obstruction the most prevalent presenting diagnosis. SPICT-positivity was a significant predictor of death before discharge and death within 6 months of first admission. Proportional agreement in predicting for PC needs of greater than 70% was shown between the two tools. Patients with PC needs comprise a significant proportion of SEC cancer admissions. This study shows the clear need for investment in staff and infrastructure to provide integrated palliative and end-of-life care as part of surgical services. The SPICTTM and SQ were shown to predict for early death in this cohort. Further validation of PC needs assessment tools is needed to guide the cost-effective implementation of PC services in low resource settings."

    "abstract": "Children with abdominal pain are frequently seen in emergency departments. Physicians and parents worry about appendicitis; physicians are also concerned about intussusception and bowel obstruction in patients with previous surgical procedures. Sometimes the patient is ill, and the diagnosis is elusive. In a 6-month period at our pediatric emergency department with an annual census of 57,400 patients, we cared for 4 patients who presented with abdominal pain due to complications of Meckel's diverticulum. None presented with painless rectal bleeding, the complication of which physicians are most aware. We are reporting these patients to raise awareness of Meckel's diverticulum as a cause of acute abdomen in children. Meckel's diverticulum may masquerade as appendicitis, an abdominal mass, intussusception, or a complication of severe constipation."

    "abstract": "The management of gynecological emergencies is essential for the preservation of the life of affected woman, her sexual functions and fertility particularly in disease conditions that threaten her life. The main objective of the study is to determine the proportion of the surgical emergencies among gynecological surgeries in a tertiary care center. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in the department of gynecology and obstetrics in Shree Birendra Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April 2013 till March 2017. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC) in November 2019. This study was conducted among 515 gynecological surgeries by using convenience sampling methods. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. Data were analyzed using Excel software. In our study, the proportion of surgical emergencies among total gynecological surgeries performed in the department of gynecology and obstetrics in Shree Birendra Hospital was 120 (23.30%). The highest number of surgical emergencies was observed in the age group of 20-29 years old, followed by less than 19 years of old age group. Ectopic pregnancy accounting for 85 (70.83%) is found to be the most common surgical emergencies in our study. Out of all surgical emergency cases, most of them underwent salpingectomy 65 (54.16%) followed by salpingectomy with tubal ligation 20 (16.16%). Surgical emergencies among gynecological surgeries are found to be in greater proportion in the department of gynecology and obstetrics in Shree Birendra Hospital. Ectopic pregnancy accounted for more than half of the diagnoses in this study."

    "abstract": "Splenic flexure volvulus (SFV) occurs as a result of twisting or torsion of a redundant colon around its mesentery. The SFV can be divided into primary and secondary types. An 82-year-old woman with a previous history of Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with a primary complaimt of obstipation and progressive abdominal pain. Abdomen was grossly distended and tympanic with generalized tenderness. The rectum was empty on digital rectal examination. Complete blood count showed leuckocytosis and neutrophlia. Plain abdominal X-rays showed distented cecum and ascending colon without any air in the gut distal to the splenic flexure. Regarding her unstable condition even aftre fluid resuscitation, she was transferred to the operating room. SFV was found and the standard left hemicolectomy was performed and bowel continiuity was established with primary anastomis of remained colonic ends. Postoperative period was uneventfull. The splenic flexure is strictly attached to the adjacent organs so its volvulus is rare. Most cases of adult SFV have an underlying disease associated with chronic constipation. Diagnosis of volvulus is suspected based on the history, clinical exam, and imaging. The initial and urgent treatment of SFV, if there are no signs of ischemia or perforation, may be conservative with endoscopic detorsion. Gangrenous bowel should not be detorted and should be resected with primary anastomosis or a diverting stoma. SFV should be considered as a possible diagnosis of chronic constipation which might be diagnosed with plain abdominal Xray in non emergent condition. Special attention should be given to the medication history of the patient as the anticholinergic agents propagate normal pristaltis."

    "abstract": "A female patient presented four years following spontaneous bladder rupture with a recurrent spontaneous bladder rupture. Summary. Urinary bladder rupture is a condition usually caused by trauma or surgical instrumentation. Spontaneous bladder rupture is a much more uncommon condition and is associated with intoxication, radiation, stricture, or neurogenic bladder. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman with a history of three caesarian sections with an idiopathic recurrent spontaneous bladder rupture. Originally, she presented with one day of worsening severe abdominal pain. CT showed possible ischemic bowel. She was taken to the operating room (OR) and found to have a bladder rupture. This was repaired, and she did well postoperatively. Four years later, she presented to the emergency department (ED) with one week of worsening abdominal pain that became severe acutely. Given that she had a similar issue four years prior the patient was suspicious, her bladder was again ruptured. CT cystogram showed contrast extravasation into the peritoneum. The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for an open repair of the bladder rupture. She did well following the procedure. Spontaneous bladder rupture is a surgical emergency and should be in the differential diagnosis of any patient with peritonitis with elevated creatinine and free intraperitoneal fluid. This diagnosis should especially be considered if the patient has a history pelvic radiation, neurogenic bladder, or intoxication. We submit that a history of multiple pelvic surgeries should be included in this list. CT cystogram is the diagnostic test of choice. Operative repair is generally the treatment for this condition."

Accidental injury covers a large portion of external genitalia trauma because of its high prevalence and severity of this disease. Here, we report the case of a 21-year-old man who underwent replantation of his self-inflicted partial amputated penis. We report a case of traumatic penile partial amputation in a 21-year-old man with a history of mental retardation that presented with a one-day history of pain on the penile shaft due to tied penile shaft with a rubber band ten days prior. Genitalia examination showed a partial amputation at the penis shaft region. Reconstruction microsurgery and debridement on the penile shaft and urethral anastomosis were performed. This case highlights the management of traumatic penile partial amputation. The urethral anastomosis and penile replantation were successfully done. Penile amputation is a rare urological emergency. Most of the cases reported with self-mutilation are a result of severe substance-induced psychosis or underlying psychiatric disorder. Factors that contribute to the successful penile replantation include the severity of the penile injury or amputation, type and mechanism of injury, team expertise available, duration of ischemia time, and use of a microscope at the time of neurovascular bundle repair. A traumatic penile partial amputation is a rare urologic emergency. Self-inflicted amputation is often found in a patient with a history of psychological or mental illness. The limited data on detailed best surgical measures and outcomes is still a concern."

Preoperative diagnosis of the SEP can be performed with preoperative imaging studies. We aimed to evaluate the clinical features of ileus cases who were diagnosed with primary or secondary SEP in the last five years. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the patients who were admitted with ileus or acute abdomen symptoms to the Emergency Department of Elazığ Training and Research Hospital and underwent surgery by the same surgical team of General Surgery Department between January 2014 and January 2019. Patients who were diagnosed with primary or secondary SEP were included. The demographic data, clinical presentation, whether the disease was primary or secondary, the treatment options performed and mortality rates were evaluated. SEP was observed in 11 of the patients. Ten patients underwent surgery (90.9%), and one patient (9.1%) was treated conservatively. Of the patients, six had secondary SEP (54.5%) and five had primary SEP (45.5%). In total, five patients were female (45.5%) and six were male (54.5%). The median age of the patients was 35 years (24-69). The median age of the patients with primary disease was 48 (29-69) years, while the median age of patients with secondary disease was 34.5 (24-64) years. One patient expired in the postoperative 8th hour. SEP should be considered in the case of recurrent abdominal pain attacks, especially in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, and it should be known that the mortality rate is high when misdiagnosed."

In treatment of ACS, the underlying fascia is left unrepaired and the subsequent fascial defect does not generally cause negative consequences. Here, we present a 24-year-old man who developed symptomatic muscle herniation 3-years after undergoing fascial release secondary to ACS of the anterior thigh. Given the size of the defect, reconstruction was performed using Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM). The patient did well, with no complications 6 months postoperatively. Symptomatic muscle herniation following fasciotomy can be treated with hernia reduction and fascial repair. When primary closure is not possible, Acelluar Dermal Matrix (ADM) is an option for successful fascial reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may be influencing disease morbidity. The purpose of this study was to investigate pandemic-related changes in the incidence of pediatric surgical emergencies. Data from patients with one of 8 typical conditions considered to be pediatric emergencies who presented at 3 hospitals close to central Tokyo were collated retrospectively from accident and emergency (AE) department records for 2020 and compared with data for 3 years prior to 2020. All subjects had similar demographic profiles. The total number of pediatric AE attendances from 2017 to 2020 was 2880 (2017: n = 600, 2018: n = 736, 2019: n = 817, and 2020: n = 727). Annual attendances were similar. Of the 8 conditions, there were significantly less cases of intussusception in 2020 than previously (23/727; 3.1% versus 132/2153; 6.1%) p < 0.01 and the number of emergency surgical interventions for intussusception was also significantly less in 2020 (0/23; 0% versus 13/132; 9.8%) p < 0.01. The implementation of preventative measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 would appear to have influenced the etiopathogenesis of intussusception enough to significantly decrease its overall incidence and the requirement for emergency surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "The sudden COVID-19 outbreak has changed our health system. Physicians had to face the challenge of treating a large number of critically ill patients with a new disease and also maintain the essential healthcare services functioning properly. To prevent disease dissemination, authorities instructed people to stay at home and seek medical care only if they experienced respiratory distress. However, there are concerns those patients did not seek necessary health care because of these orientations. This study aims to see how the pandemic has influenced the severity of the disease, complication, and mortality of patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy and appendectomy. Retrospective review of medical records of patients admitted to the emergency department and undergoing to cholecystectomy and appendicectomy in the periods from March to May 2019 and 2020. We observed that COVID-19 did not change the severity of presentation or the outcome of patients with gallbladder disease, but caused a 24.2% increase in the prevalence of complicated appendicitis (p<0.05). However, disagreeing with what was expected, we did not identify a greater number of perioperative complications in patients undergoing an appendectomy. Therefore, it seems that in a university tertiary referral center COVID-19 did not influence the management and outcome of inflammatory diseases treated in the surgical emergency department."

    "abstract": "Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a surgical emergency that generally develops in the outpatient setting. Hospitalized patients are also at risk for acute limb ischemia, but their presentation may be atypical or altered by medical therapy. Our institution developed an alert system to facilitate the prompt recognition and treatment of ALI that occurs in the inpatient population. We aimed to evaluate the usage of the system after the first 2 years of operation. All ALI alerts from October 2017 to December 2019 were collected from paging records and analyzed for location, timing, and the need for intervention. Alerts undergoing vascular intervention were classified as urgent (within 8 hours) or delayed (after 8 hr). Time and location data were evaluated to determine patterns of usage and true-positive rate of the system. From October 2017 to December 2019, there were 237 ALI alerts obtained from paging records containing time and location information for the alert. More alerts originated from ICUs relative to non-ICU floors (68% vs. 33%, P< 0.001), however a greater proportion of non-ICU floor alerts required intervention compared to ICU alerts (32.0% vs. 5.1%, P < .0001). The highest number of ALI alerts were from the Medical ICU (MRICU) (45.9%) and medical/surgical floors (33.3%), followed by Surgical ICU (20.2%). Alerts were more common within 3 hr of morning and evening nursing shift changes (47.3%, P < 0.001). From the 237 total alerts, the patient was able to be identified retrospectively in 186 cases, and of these 27 resulted in operative interventions (14.5%, positive predictive value), with 11 patients (40.7%) requiring urgent intervention with a median time to intervention of 3.5 hr (range 2.2-4.8), and 16 (59%) alerts undergoing a delayed intervention at a mean of 3 days (range 2-4). A total of 73 (39.2%) alert patients died during their admission, of which 65 (89.0%) were in an ICU, and no deaths were directly related to ALI. The median time to death was 2 days (range 0-95 days), and in 22 cases death occurred <24 hr from time of alert. Our novel hospital-wide ALI alert system demonstrates a 14.5% positive predictive value for ischemia that resulted in an intervention. Alerts were more likely to originate from the ICU setting and during nursing shift changes. Alerts originating from non-ICU floors were 5 times more likely to undergo surgical intervention for ALI. Further analysis is required to assess the effect of this system on patient safety, outcome, and allocation of institutional resources."

A 25-year-old male (169 cm, 84 kg) was transferred to the emergency room due to severe lancinating (Numerical Pain Rating 10/10) abdominal pain that occurred during weight training at a gym. An orthopedic surgeon, an internist, and a general surgeon assessed him for internal and surgical emergencies. The magnetic resonance imaging of his abdomen revealed a bilateral full-thickness tear of the rectus abdominis muscle. The patient was given an option of surgical repair of the RA, but he refused. Six weeks later, he attended our sports medicine department. A criteria-based rehabilitation program was planned, with weekly follow-ups. The patient could walk pain-free at 4th week and jog at 10th week of rehabilitation. Significant improvements in the range of movement of the trunk, pain levels and functional capacity were noted at discharge and 6 and 12-month follow-ups. Clinical management of this patient is described in detail, with emphasis on diagnostic ultrasonography.

Respiratory symptoms and flu-like presentation are the most defined clinical manifestations. However, gastrointestinal symptoms with acute abdomen have been reported in a small percentage, occasionally mimicking acute appendicitis. Hence, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be suspected and investigated in every case of acute abdomen in the present situation. We report a case of a 25-year-old male who presented with features of acute appendicitis. Despite the equivocal ultrasound results, he was scheduled for an emergency appendectomy for Alvarado's score 7 out of 10, who underwent a successful appendectomy. The patient had initially tested negative on an upper respiratory COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with normal chest X-ray but few hours after the surgery patient developed a high-grade fever. An RT-PCR for COVID-19 was resent following a suspicion that came out to be positive. Several case reports have suggested a probable association between COVID-19 and appendicitis. This case shows the limited effectiveness of clinical diagnosis for the surgical abdomen in COVID-19 patients as these two conditions share similar symptoms often needing a clinical vigilance. This case reports acute appendicitis in a patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 subsequently following emergency appendectomy highlighting the acute gastrointestinal presentation of COVID-19. This case exemplifies the necessity to be familiar with the gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 and maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 infection in cases of abdominal pain."

The only independent variable associated with the presence of postoperative complications was symptom duration prior to surgery greater than or equal to 48 hours (OR 4.8; 95 % CI 1.1-16.2; p 0.04). Seven minor and 2 mayor postoperative complications were observed. Patients with complications spent, on average, twice as many days hospitalized (p < 0.001); and had 8 times more risk of preterm delivery (p 0.03). Obstetric complications were more frequent in pregnant women operated during the first trimester. Foetal mortality was 1.6 %.

This report is of a case of a 2-year-old boy who developed an aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) after swallowing a button battery and was successfully treated using a novel vascular plug device as a bridge to definitive surgical repair. AEF is diagnosed using computed tomography angiography (CTA), after laparotomy, and using aortography. Aortic endovascular stenting and vascular occluder placement is a minimally invasive emergency option until definitive treatment can be provided. The surgical options include repair the aortic defect primarily, or the diseased segment of the aorta is replaced with a graft. CASE REPORT A 2-year-old boy presented with hematemesis 9 days after ingestion of a button battery, which was removed endoscopically 16 hours after the incident. The patient was resuscitated aggressively and diagnosed to have AEF using computed tomography angiography (CTA). The aorta was successfully repaired using a vascular plug device, which kept the patient safe until the definitive surgical treatment was done 2 months later. The defect was repaired with direct anastomosis and completed with a patch of bovine pericardium, as well as closure of the fistula from the esophageal side with stitches. CONCLUSIONS This report presents a rare but previously reported complication of swallowing a button battery, resulting in an aortoesophageal fistula. The aorta was successfully repaired using a vascular plug as a minimally invasive emergency option, which is considered as a lifesaving procedure and a bridge for definitive repair."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia is a common surgical emergency. Restoration of blood flow is a critical objective of treating this pathology. However, many patients suffer from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries at the time of revascularization, requiring prolonged hospitalizations. B-1a cells are a subtype of B lymphocytes with roles in regulating inflammation and tissue injury by spontaneous release of natural IgM and IL-10. We hypothesized that treatment with B-1a cells protects mice from intestinal I/R. Mesenteric ischemia was induced in mice by placing a vascular clip on the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes. At the time of reperfusion, B-1a cells or PBS control were instilled into the peritoneal cavity (PerC) of mice. PerC lavage, blood, intestine, and lungs were collected 4 h after reperfusion. Serum organ injury and inflammatory markers such as ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, IL-6, as well as lung and gut histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were assessed. In intestinal I/R, B-1a cell frequency and number in the PerC were significantly decreased compared to sham-operated mice. There was an increase in the serum levels of ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, and IL-6 when comparing the vehicle group with the sham group. These increases were significantly reduced in the B-1a cell treated group. B-1a cell treatment significantly decreased the intestine and lung injury scores as well as MPO content, compared to vehicle treated mice. B-1a cell treatment resulted in a reduction of apoptotic cells in these tissues. Serum IgM levels were decreased in intestinal I/R, while treatment with B-1a cells significantly increased their levels towards normal levels. B-1a cell treatment at the time of mesenteric reperfusion ameliorates end organ damage and reduces systemic inflammation through the improvement of serum IgM levels. Preserving B-1a cells pool could serve as a novel therapeutic avenue in intestinal I/R injury."

The clinical presentation of this sub-type of hernia is non-specific. Precise knowledge of the hernia sac content preoperatively is not mandatory, and it should not delay prompt emergency surgery. As long as there are no local signs of complicated appendicitis, a single inguinal incision may be sufficient to perform appendectomy and hernia repair. In the event of complicated appendicitis, an exploratory of the abdominal cavity is mandatory, and hybrid approaches are recommended. For an experienced surgeon, the laparoscopic approach (TAPP), including the treatment of the two pathologies and the exploration of the peritoneal cavity, represents the surgical technique of choice. De Garengeot's strangulated hernia with appendicitis is an exceedingly rare double surgical emergency. When uncomplicated appendicitis, a single inguinal incision is sufficient to treat both appendicitis and abdominal wall defect. Hernia reduction, which young surgeons in the emergency room commonly attempt, should be abolished."

    "abstract": "Background  The quick sequential organ failure assessment (QSOFA) score and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria were developed to predict the risk of sepsis and death in patients received in emergency. To improve sensitivity in predicting death, the association of the two scores was proposed under the term QSIRS (QSOFA + SIRS). Our aim was to determine the accuracy of QSOFA, SIRS, and QSIRS in prediction of mortality in surgical emergencies, and to compare these scores. Patients and Methods  This is a prospective study over a period of 1 year. Patients older than 15 years who presented a digestive surgical emergency (bowel obstruction, peritonitis, appendicitis, strangulated hernia) were included. For each score, the specificity, the sensitivity, the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were compared. Results  One hundred and eighteen patients were included and 11 deaths were recorded (9.3%). There was a statistically significant relationship between each score and death (QSOFA p  = 0.01, SIRS p  = 0.003, and QSIRS p  = 0.004). The realization of the ROC curve found a higher AUC for QSIRS (0.845 [0.767-0.905]) compared with QSOFA (0.783 [0.698-0.854]) and SIRS (0.737 [0.648-0.813]). QSIRS (90.9%) had a higher sensitivity compared with the two other scores alone (SIRS = 81.9% and QSOFA = 36.3%). Conclusion  Our study found that QSIRS improves the ability to predict death in digestive surgical emergencies."

CASE REPORT Here, we present a case of ovarian torsion and appendicitis in an 11-year-old premenarchal girl who presented to our emergency room with a 4-day history of right iliac fossa pain, limping, and fever. Upon initial evaluation in our hospital, her vital signs were stable and clinical examination revealed abdominal guarding and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness with positive Rovsing's sign. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scans showed adnexal cysts and torsion, an inflamed appendix, and free fluid in the abdomen. Intraoperative findings included a twisted gangrenous ovary and an edematous appendix. The patient underwent emergency laparoscopic oophorectomy and appendectomy. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates that reactive appendicitis can occur secondary to inflammation of adjacent structures such as the ovary."

Pressure injury risk factors. A generalised linear mixed model including admission type outperformed a model without admission type (p = 0.004). Admission type Trauma/Burns was not withheld in the model and excluded from further analyses. For the other three admission types (Medical, Surgical elective, and Surgical emergency), backward elimination resulted in distinct prediction models with 23, 17, and 16 predictors, respectively, and five common predictors only. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve was 0.79 for Medical admissions; and 0.88 for both the Surgical elective and Surgical emergency models. Risk factors for pressure injury differ according to whether intensive care patients have been admitted for medical reasons, or elective or emergency surgery. Prediction models for pressure injury should target distinct subpopulations with differing pressure injury risk profiles. Type of intensive care admission is a simple and easily retrievable parameter to distinguish between such subgroups."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a pediatric surgical emergency, and prompt diagnosis and treatment is imperative. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric patients with symptoms of testicular torsion may be reluctant to seek medical care which increases the likelihood of delayed presentation and the need for an orchiectomy. This observational study sought to determine whether there was a higher number of testicular torsion cases during COVID-19. As the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted to our facility on March 6, 2020, we identified male children ages 1-18 years with testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 (during COVID-19) compared to the same time period between 2015 and 2019 (prior to COVID-19). All patients were evaluated at our Institution's Emergency Department by a pediatric urologist. There were 38 cases of testicular torsion between March 1-December 31, 2020 compared to 15.8 cases on average during the same 10-month period between 2015 and 2019 (a total of 79 cases). There was a statistically significant increase in testicular torsion cases during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to equivalent time periods in 2015-2019 (38 vs. 15.8, p = 0.05). Patients with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 pandemic were younger, had a longer duration of symptoms, and had a higher number of orchiectomies (although not statistically significant). During the COVID-19 pandemic, an escalation in testicular torsion cases was observed. Timely assessment, diagnosis, and surgery are crucial to prevent testicular loss and potential infertility in the future. Further evaluation is needed to elucidate the surge in testicular torsion and possible mechanisms."

To assess whether the time from the initial insult to the fasciotomy of compartment syndrome of the upper extremity affects outcomes and to examine the differences between compartment syndrome secondary to fractures and that resulting from a non-fracture etiology with regard to the time from insult to fasciotomy and the long-term patient outcomes. Patients presented with documented fasciotomy treatment following acute upper extremity compartment syndrome and a minimum of 6 months follow-up. Patient information included demographics, cause of compartment syndrome, method of diagnosis, and outcome on follow-up. Our study was comprised of 25 patients. Fasciotomies were performed for compartment syndrome caused by fracture in 11 patients (44%), and due to insults other than fractures in 14 patients (56%). The average time to fasciotomy in patients without a fracture was 10.21 hours and 16.55 hours with a fracture. Fasciotomy performed more than 24 hours from the initial insult was not found to significantly affect long-term sequelae compared to fasciotomy performed earlier than 24 hours from the initial insult. The non-fracture group had more long-term sequelae than the fracture group (13/15 patients and 5/11 patients, respectively). Most injuries treated for fasciotomy of compartment syndrome were non-fracture related, with more complications found in patients with non-fracture related injuries. Time interval from insult to fasciotomy did not affect outcome and was longer in the fracture group, suggesting longer monitoring in this group and supporting fasciotomy even with late presentation."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency, and challenges in access to surgery in a low middle-income country can direct cost implications. A prospective cost of illness study was conducted at Alotau Provincial Hospital (APH) from October 14, 2019, to June 1, 2020. A bottom-up approach of microcosting was used to estimate the direct medical cost of consecutive patients with acute appendicitis undergoing surgery. The mean cost of acute appendicitis surgery for each patient was K39,517.66 (US$11,460.12) for uncomplicated appendicitis, K45,873.99 (US$13,303.46) for complicated appendicitis and K38,838.80 (US$ 11,263.25) for a normal appendix. In total, the direct medical cost for acute appendicitis in this study was K4,562,625.29 (US$ 1,323,161.33) with the majority of expenditure incurred by surgical ward expenses. This study demonstrates that direct medical costs for uncomplicated appendicitis surgery in a resource-limited hospital are less expensive. As the pathology progresses, the cost also exponentially increases. Policy makers and clinicians must establish appropriate curative surgical services at secondary (NOM of acute appendicitis and laparoscopic surgery) and primary health-care levels to address acute appendicitis surgery as this can reduce costs."

The treatment by arthroscopic debridement and lavage with diluted Povidone-Iodine has potential benefits that may be useful in improving the prognosis for patients. This case report discusses the potential benefits of using antiseptics like Povidone-Iodine in the washout of the affected joint. We present a patient with post arthroscopic septic knee arthritis caused by P. aeruginosa treated successfully by arthroscopic synovectomy and washout with normal saline and diluted povidone‑iodine, and prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Preceding reports of P. aeruginosa suggest intraoperative factors, postoperative factors, and host factors that may lead to this uncommon infection. There is controversy over the optimal management regarding arthroscopic versus open debridement, and the choice of the irrigating fluid. The use of antiseptics like Povidone-Iodine in the washout procedure may lead to improved outcomes if used for a short controlled period of time and followed by copious irrigation with saline. Further studies must be done to determine the efficacy and risk-to-benefit ratio of this method."

    "abstract": "Emergency laparotomy (EL) is a central, high-risk procedure in emergency surgery. Patients in need of an EL present an acute pathology in the abdomen that must be operated on in order to save their lives. Usually, the underlying condition produces an affected physiology. The perioperative management of this critically ill patient group in need of high-risk surgery and anaesthesia is challenging and related to high mortality worldwide. However, outcomes in Sweden have yet to be studied. This retrospective cohort study explores the perioperative management and outcome after 710 ELs by investigating mortality, overall length of stay (LOS) in hospital, need for care at the intensive care unit (ICU), surgical complications and a general review of perioperative management. Medical records after laparotomy was retrospectively analysed for a period of 38 months (2014-2017), the emergency cases were included. Children (< 18 years), aortic surgery, second look and other expected reoperations were excluded. Demographic, management and outcome data were collected after an extensive analysis of the cohort. A total of 710 consecutive operations, representing 663 patients, were included in the cohort (mean age 65.6 years). Mortality (30 days/1 year) after all operations was 14.2% and 26.6% respectively. The mean LOS in hospital was 12 days, while LOS in the ICU was five days. Of all operations, 23.8% patients were admitted at any time to the ICU postoperatively and the 30-day mortality seen among ICU patients was 37.9%. Mortality was strongly correlated to existing comorbidity, high ASA classification, ICU care and faecal peritonitis. The mean/median time from notification to operate until the first incision was 3:46/3:02 h and 87% of patients had their first incision within 6 h of notification. In this present Swedish study, high mortality and morbidity were observed after emergency laparotomy, which is in agreement with other recent studies. The study has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03549624, registered 8 June 2018)."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency with a lifetime incidence of 7%-8%. There are two operative modalities that are currently used for the management of this condition in the paediatric population. The objective of this cohort study was to review the outcome of the management of paediatric surgical patients presenting with acute appendicitis after either an open appendectomy (OA) or laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) was performed. This was a 2-year retrospective study conducted from 01 January 2016 until 31 December 2017 on paediatric surgical patients < 13 years of age undergoing appendectomies. Eighty-one (n = 81) files of patients were reviewed, and data analysis was performed on two comparative groups namely the OA group and LA group, with the aid of the SAS system with statistical significance based on P < 0.05. During the study period, 81 children (male: female ratio of 2:1) underwent appendectomies. Nearly 38% (n = 31) of the cases had an OA, with 62% (n = 50) of the cases having an LA. Seven (14%) LA cases were converted to OA. Simple appendicitis accounted for 16% (n = 13) of the patients, with complicated appendicitis accounting for 79% (n = 64) and other pathologies accounting for 5% (n = 4). There were no post-operative complications in the cases of simple appendicitis. Six cases (15.38%) in the LA group versus two cases (5.26%) in the OA group developed intra-abdominal collections, which was statistically significant (P = 0.018). One (2.56%) patient in the LA group versus two patients (7.89%) in the OA group developed intestinal ileus (P = 0.09). Two patients (5.13%) in the LA group versus six patients (15.79%) in the OA group developed surgical-site infection, which was statistically significant (P = 0.013). The mean days of hospital stay was 4.51 days in the LA group versus 5.34 days in the OA group, which was statistically significant (P = 0.016). There were no re-admissions or re-operations in the simple appendicitis group. In the complicated appendicitis cases, five cases (12.82%) were re-admitted in the LA group compared to five cases (13.16%) in the OA group (P = 0.943). Two (5.13%) cases had a re-operation in the LA group compared to one case (2.63%) in the OA group (P = 0.360). Considering that there was an increased incidence of complicated cases and operations being performed by trainees, LA appears feasible at a tertiary-level hospital in a developing country, as shown in this study. Therefore, cases of simple appendicitis can be performed laparoscopically; however with regard to complicated appendicitis, there is no superiority between the two operative modalities in this study, which is consistent with international literature. However, in this study, it can be postulated that the learning curve was a major contributory factor to the increased levels of complications, as all operations were performed by trainees. Therefore, we recommend implementation of adequate simulation practices in laparoscopy in the setting of a developing country to attain the laparoscopic expertise of our international counterparts in order to improve the standard of care."

Abdominal pain is less common than other symptoms but is more frequent among patients with severe disease. Various abdominal imaging findings are described in the literature for children and adults with COVID-19 infection. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy is reported in pediatric patients with COVID-19 gastrointestinal infection. It is very rarely reported in the adult population. We report a case of an adult male with multiple risk factors, who presented with severe abdominal pain and tenderness in the right inguinal fossa. He was evaluated for differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis, renal colic, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and COVID-19. His investigations showed normal laboratory tests and a normal chest radiograph. His CT abdomen showed a normal appendix and multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes. His COVID-19 PCR was positive. He was discharged after pain relief with home isolation instructions and symptomatic management. Our case represents an atypical clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection in many ways. His laboratory investigations were not suggestive of COVID-19. Our patient's abdominal imaging findings represent a rare association of COVID-19 with mesenteric lymphadenitis in adults. The clinical course of our patient was smooth after discharge and he did not develop any complications of COVID-19 despite multiple risk factors. Our case reminds the significance of keeping broad diagnostic differentials in the emergency department. Although mesenteric lymphadenitis is often a self-limiting condition affecting children and young adults, it is the most frequent alternative diagnosis of acute appendicitis and intussusception. Mesenteric lymphadenitis can be the sole atypical presentation of COVID-19 in adults. Atypical presentations are not uncommon due to the scarcity of data on this evolving disease."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Omental infarction (OI) is an infrequent cause of acute abdominal pain, and there is no consensus on whether conservative or surgical treatment should be performed. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, so many patients are referred for surgery because of acute abdominal signs that may indicate other diseases such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, or peptic ulcer perforation. In most cases, infarction of the greater omentum is diagnosed only during emergency surgery for other diseases of the abdomen. Currently, multisequence computed tomography is performed for acute abdomen, and this disease is increasingly diagnosed preoperatively. CASE REPORT We report on 2 patients who were referred to our Emergency Department for acute abdominal pain. Both were female and middle-aged. The first patient presented with vomiting and right upper-quadrant pain with thickened and right subcostal omental infiltration on computed tomography (CT). The second patient presented with right subcostal pain and fever. CT showed signs of infiltration, thickening of the omentum, and a right upper subcostal mass measuring 22×60 mm. We performed emergency laparoscopic surgery to explore the abdominal cavity. Both patients were discharged after 3 days. CONCLUSIONS Omentum infarction is a rare disease that causes a diagnostic dilemma, as there is a wide spectrum of causes of acute abdomen. Many patients are diagnosed only during surgery.

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic hernia (DH), congenital or traumatic, is uncommon but sometimes can lead to a serious surgical emergency. There are no clinical guidelines or approved recommendations for the management of this condition, and most data are from retrospective, single-institution series. The aim is to analyze the management of the DH at our institution and review the indications for laparoscopic repair. A retrospective serie of patients diagnosed of DH with surgical treatment at our institution between 2009 and 2019. Literature review was carried out to establish the current indications of laparoscopic repair in each type of DH. Surgery was carried out in 15 patients with DH, 5 congenital and 10 traumatic hernias. Traumatic hernias were classified as acute (n = 2) and chronic (n = 8). 53.4% of all cases (8 patients) required urgent surgery using an abdominal approach (5 open and 3 laparoscopic) and elective surgery was performed in 46.6% of all cases (7 patients) with an abdominal approach (3 open and 4 laparoscopic) and 2 patients with a combined approach. Primary repair was performed in 4 patients (26.6%), closure and mesh reinforcement in 9 cases (60%) and only mesh placement in 2 patients (13.4%). Postoperative morbidity and mortality were 20% and 0%, respectively. No recurrences were detected. DH may pose different scenarios which require urgent or elective surgical treatment. Laparoscopic approach may be a first option in elective surgery; and in emergency setting taking into account hemodynamic stability and associated injuries."

    "abstract": "We present a case of a 41-year-old woman who visited the emergency department (ED) with acute abdomen. She was diagnosed with perforated appendicitis and abscess formation on CT. She was treated conservatively with antibiotics and discharged. On control CT 3 months later, the appendix had healed, but signs of thickening of the terminal ileum were noticed and colonoscopy was performed, which was uneventful and showed no signs of inflammation. Twelve hours later, she developed pain in the right lower quadrant, followed by fever, and visited the ED. Physical examination and blood work showed signs consistent with acute appendicitis, and appendectomy was performed laparoscopically 6 hours later. The patient recovered remarkably shortly afterwards. Whether colonoscopy resulted in de novo appendicitis or exacerbated an already existing inflammation remains unknown. However, endoscopists should be aware of this rare, yet serious complication and consider it in the workup of post-colonoscopy abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the leading cause of surgical acute abdomen in pediatrics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, management strategies were reassessed and the number of visits to the emergency department dropped down, which may be associated with delayed diagnoses and complications. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the pandemic on children with acute appendicitis. Analytical, retrospective, comparative study of pediatric patients with acute appendicitis in the 5 months of COVID-19 lockdown versus the same period in the previous year. Incidence, clinical data, stage, surgical approach, and complications were analyzed. The total number of appendicitis cases went down by 25% (n = 67 versus n = 50 in 2020). The mean time to consultation was 24 hours in both periods (p = 0.989). The incidence of peritonitis was 44% (n = 22) versus 37% (n = 22) (p = 0.22) in 2019. No differences were observed in terms of appendicitis stage based on surgery reports. In 2019, all surgeries were laparoscopic; while in 2020, only 42% (n = 21). The incidence of complications was 6% versus 7.5% in the previous period (p = 0.75). One patient was COVID-19 positive. Although in our population the number of appendicitis cases dropped down, consultation was not delayed. The greater impact was associated with the reformulation of management strategies, in which the laparoscopic approach is avoided to reduce virus transmission. Introducción. La apendicitis constituye la principal causa de abdomen agudo quirúrgico en pediatría. Durante la pandemia por COVID-19, se replantearon las estrategias de manejo y disminuyeron las consultas en las guardias, lo que podría asociarse a diagnósticos tardíos y complicaciones. El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar el impacto de la pandemia en los niños con apendicitis aguda. Métodos. Estudio analítico retrospectivo comparativo de pacientes pediátricos con apendicitis aguda durante los cinco meses del confinamiento por COVID-19 versus los meses equivalentes del año previo. Se analizaron la incidencia, la clínica, el estadio, el abordaje quirúrgico y las complicaciones. Resultados. Los casos totales de apendicitis se redujeron un 25% (n = 67 versus n = 50 en 2020). El tiempo medio hasta la consulta fue de 24 horas en ambos períodos (p = 0,989). La incidencia de peritonitis fue del 44% (n = 22) versus el 37% (n = 22) (p = 0,22) en 2019. No se evidenció diferencia en los estadios de enfermedad de acuerdo con lo informado en los partes quirúrgicos. En 2019, todas las cirugías se realizaron por vía laparoscópica; en 2020, solo un 42% (n = 21). La incidencia de complicaciones fue del 6%, contra 7,5% en el período previo (p = 0,75). Un paciente fue COVID-19 positivo. Conclusión. A pesar de la reducción en el número de casos de apendicitis, no se evidenció una demora en la consulta en nuestra población. El mayor impacto se asoció a la readecuación del manejo, evitando el abordaje laparoscópico para reducir la diseminación del virus."

We report a case of a 71- year-old male seen at the Emergency Department of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Malaysia, on anticoagulant therapy for valvular atrial fibrillation, who had sustained a closed fracture of the left distal end radius following a fall. Examination of the left upper limb showed deformity and tenderness over the left wrist, associated with swelling and a tense anterior compartment with blisters formation and rapid expansion of hematoma at the cubital fossa away from the fracture site. Both radial and brachial pulses were absent and confirmed with the absence of a doppler signal over the brachial and radial artery and CT angiography of the left upper limb showed there was a vascular injury of the brachial artery. Fasciotomy of the left upper limb and revascularization of the left brachial artery was done. Intraoperative findings showed a tight anterior compartment with muscle bulging upon compartment release with a complete cut of the left distal brachial artery. The primary end-to-end vascular anastomosis was done and distal circulation was restored. The distal end radius fracture was treated conservatively. The patient underwent split skin grafting of the left forearm after 6 weeks post-injury and went home well. It is critical to recognize a concomitant vascular injury in fracture-related ACS as the clinical feature may overlap. Failure in detection of concomitant vascular injury may lead to emergency fasciotomy without vascular exploration and repair."

This retrospective, cross-sectional, observational case series involved review of medical records of all patients presenting to the glaucoma service during the COVID-19 lockdown period and comparison with the previous year (March 23 to June 23, 2020 Vs 2019) in a tertiary center in India. We found a 78.9% reduction in overall outpatient visits (54,345 vs. 257,339; P < 0.001) and 80.9% reduction in the number of glaucoma outpatient visits (4,788 vs. 25,083; P < 0.001). Additionally, the proportion of true glaucoma emergency visits significantly increased by 62.4% in 2020 Vs 2019 (1,408/4,788 (29.4%) vs. 4,542/25,083 (18.1%); P < 0.001). Lens-induced glaucomas were the most common glaucoma surgical emergency (13.4%) in 2020. Moreover, comparison of procedures demonstrated a proportionate decrease in incisional glaucoma surgeries (70/115 (60.86%) vs. 806/939 (85.83%); P < 0.001) and an increase in the proportion of emergency cataract surgeries (129/475 (27.15%) vs. 170/2715 (6.26%); P < 0.001) and transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (45/115 (39.13%) vs. 133/939 (14.16%); P = 0.0001) during 2020 vs. 2019. Our study demonstrated a 62% increase in the proportion of visits that were true glaucoma emergencies. Additionally, the proportions of emergency cataract surgeries increased by 4.3 times and the proportion of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation increased by 2.8 times during the pandemic. More nonincisional procedures and less diagnostic testing were performed to minimize postoperative visits and virus transmission. Further understanding of the profile of emergencies may help in developing novel strategies to anticipate future challenges in managing glaucoma care during subsequent waves of the pandemic."

In this paper, we present a case of chyloperitoneum associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and a review of literature regarding chylous ascites. A 76-year-old male patient was admitted in emergency department with acute abdomen. A pancreatic cancer was suspected. Subtotal spleno-pancreatectomy, for a nodular mass infiltrating the mild and distal portion of the pancreas, was necessary. During surgical intervention in the peritoneal cavity, a moderate quantity of whitish and thick consistency fluid with milk-like appearance was observed to be accumulated. After examination of the fluid, chyloperitoneum was diagnosed. The histologic examination showed a PDAC, with multiple emboli in lymph vessels, with tumor cells with plasmacytoid morphology, diagnosed as lymphangiosis carcinomatosa. The patient died at 3 weeks after surgical intervention. In patients with pancreatic cancer and chylous ascites, suspicion of tumor-related blockage of the lymphatic flow should be suspected. Prognosis of PDAC should be evaluated not only based on the number of lymph node metastases, but also considering the number of lymph vessels with tumor emboli and the architecture of tumor cells. This is the first reported case of a PDAC with plasmacytoid morphology of lymphangiosis carcinomatosa."

Risk prediction is not routinely performed prior to surgery. All patients aged >65 years undergoing appendicectomy over 5 years from one NHS Trust were included. Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification system (ASA grade), Rockwood score, type of surgery, length of stay, morbidity and 90-day mortality were recorded. ACS NSQIP was retrospectively calculated. Spearman's Rank correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis were conducted, assessing correlation between ASA, Age, Rockwood Score and ACS NSQIP with length of stay and post-operative complications. A total of 225 patient cases were reviewed. A complication rate of 29.3% was recorded, with a 6.7% serious complication rate. Two mortalities occurred. ASA, Age, Rockwood and NSQIP scoring systems all showed low degree positive correlation with length of stay (+0.16-+0.34). As predictors of length of stay, ASA was superior. Rockwood and age showed low degree positive correlation (+0.25-+0.33) with post-operative complications. NSQIP and ASA demonstrated a greater degree of correlation (+0.38-+0.40). Both ASA and ACS NSQIP appear superior indicators for outcomes compared to age and Rockwood score. However, caution is warranted when interpreting the superiority of ASA over validated risk stratification tools. Therefore, we advocate the use of pre-operative risk stratification for elderly patients undergoing low-risk surgery such as appendicectomy. Validated tools are not routinely applied in many centres currently. Utilisation of scores such as ACS NSQIP may help improve consent, patient selection, outcomes and expectations."

Materials ranging from metallic to non-metallic like plastic bottles are used by the patients. The important factors to be considered for the successful treatment include the availability of instruments and the surgical skills of the doctor. A 45 year-old man with a comorbidity of severe depression presented to Emergency with a two months long history of penile strangulation with a plastic bottle neck. The gross appearance of the penis showed edema and proliferative growths. He was intervened with a cable wire cutter as standard instrument failed to do so. The patient was discharged on the same day of intervention. However, he was lost to subsequent follow up. Penile strangulation which is common in people with mental disorders should be considered as a surgical emergency as it can present with devastating complications. No specific methods and tools have been recommended for the removal of those objects. The shame felt by patient is the root cause for late surgical consultation and are prone to develop complications. Simple instruments can be used for the intervention provided good surgical skills are demonstrated. Common in psychiatric patients who deny medical attention due to shame, penile strangulation should be intervened quickly and simple instruments not routinely used in surgical practice can be effectively used to remove the offending objects."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) is a pathological process that implicates the ascending aorta and represents a surgical emergency burdened by high mortality if not promptly treated in the first hours of onset. Despite best efforts, the annual incidence rates of aortic dissection has remained stable over the past decades. We measured aortic dimensions (aortic diameters, area, length and volume) using 3D multiplanar reconstruction imaging with the purpose of refining the risk- morphology for AAAD. Computerized tomography angiography studies of three groups were compared retrospectively: patients affected by AAAD (AAAD group; n=71), patients affected by aortic aneurysm and subsequently subjected to ascending aorta replacement (Aneurysm, n=77) and a healthy aorta's group (Control, n=75). Mean diameters of AAAD (4.9 cm) and Aneurysm (5.1 cm) aortas were significantly larger than those of the control group (3.4 cm). In AAAD patients, an ascending aorta diameter greater than 5.5 cm was observed in 18% of patients. Multiple comparisons showed statistically significant differences among mean of the ratio of aortic root area to height between the three groups (P<0.001). In frontal and sagittal planes, the length of the ascending aorta was significantly greater in patients affected by aortic pathology (AAAD and aneurysm) than in the control group (P<0.001). Significant differences were confirmed when indexing the aortic length to patient's height and BSA, and the aortic volume to patient's BSA. Maximum transverse diameter, considered separately, is not the best predictor of aortic dissection. In our opinion, the introduction into clinical practice of measurements of the area, length, and volume of the aorta, as absolute or indexed values, could improve the selection of patients who would benefit from preventive surgical aortic replacement."

    "abstract": "Propylene sutures are non-absorbable sterile surgical sutures, which when present intra-abdominally act as a foreign body leading to adhesion formation. Post-operative adhesions are a common cause of bowel obstruction, with complete closed loop obstruction presenting as a surgical emergency. A 66-year-old man who had undergone a laparotomy for bowel obstruction two years back, presented to our emergency department with features of complete bowel obstruction. Midline laparotomy revealed propylene suture and intra peritoneal adhesions acting as a constricting band around the jejunum to be the cause. Adhesions are common perturbing problem after surgeries. The presence of a foreign body further incites the process of adhesion formation by causing hindrance to the fibrinolysis process. In this case, the adhesive bands acted synergistically with the encircling prolene suture material from the previous surgery in causing a complete loop obstruction. Propylene sutures used in routine surgical procedures can migrate intra-abdominally, and lead to adhesion formation. Adhesions along with the non-absorbable suture can cause complete bowel obstruction."

IFTT has a proclivity to affect adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15 years and is rarely seen in premenarchal or perimenopausal women. Due to a lack of pathognomonical features, IFTT is difficult to diagnose. Adnexal torsion, including IFTT is a surgical diagnosis and no clinical or imaging criteria is sufficient to diagnose IFTT. Urgent laparoscopy and detorsion are required for preservation of the affected fallopian tube. However, given the diagnostic ambiguity, IFTT diagnosis is often delayed. IFTT should be included in the differential diagnoses for adolescent patients with acute abdomen when imaging demonstrates a normal appendix and ovaries. We report a 15-year-old girl with a 4-day history of abdominopelvic pain and bilateral paratubal cysts resulting in right IFTT."

A non-invasive sensor is needed of satisfactory sensitivity to continuously monitor the alterations of the ACS pressure, which could be used as a supplementary means in the early diagnosis of ACS. A prepared \"pasting-type\" flexible pressure sensor was used to establish an extracorporeal pig-skin model with a soft-tissue expander device to simulate compartment syndrome conditions. An acrylic panel was inserted into the pig skin, allowing the soft-tissue expander to expand in one direction, which is similar to the movements of a patient's bones in real life. The touch spot of the flexible pressure sensor was attached to the rind by medical tape, to record the internal and external pressure data. Relationships between the internal and external pressures at different thickness (0.87 mm, 3.53 mm and 3.97 mm), as well as that of the 3.97 mm thickness under various initial internal pressures (0.5 mmHg, 25 mmHg and 44 mmHg) were measured. Significant differences were observed in the range of internal pressures at various pig-skin thickness. After adding the acrylic panel, the measured ranges were significantly increased, with the lowest measurable internal pressure being 5 mmHg. Moreover, alterations in external pressure were also greater than in models without acrylic panels. The external pressure measured by the sensor was able to reflect an increase in intra-organizational pressure. This may be a new non-invasive and sustainable method for early diagnosis of ACS."

We performed a retrospective case-control study of all patients treated surgically for acute complete and incomplete CES in our neurosurgical department from 2009 to 2020, focusing on the preoperative BMI and postoperative neurological outcome. In addition, we performed a comprehensive literature review. Fifty patients with CES were included, of whom 96% suffered from a decompensated lumbar spinal stenosis or disc prolapse between the L4/5 and L5/S1 levels. Our cohort population was overweight but not obese: mean BMI was 27.5 kg/m2, compared with 27.6 kg/m2 in patients with degenerative spine surgery. BMI did not significantly influence the postoperative outcome, but it did affect preoperative symptoms and surgery duration. Symptom duration significantly differed depending on the underlying cause for CES. The literature review revealed sparse evidence, with only four clinical case series presenting contradictory results. We provide a comprehensive literature review on the current evidence regarding CES and obesity and conclude that we did not observe an association between obesity and CES occurrence. Patients with CES and other degenerative spinal pathologies belong to an overweight but not obese population.

Laparoscopic appendectomy has become the treatment of choice for both complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis; common postoperative complications include wound infection, bleeding, intraabdominal abscess. Stump appendicitis is defined as the interval repeated inflammation of remaining residual appendiceal tissue after an appendectomy. 38-Year-old female patient with a history of laparoscopic appendectomy performed in 2016 for acute uncomplicated appendicitis. She arrived to the emergency room due to abdominal pain 7 out of 10, located in the periumbilical region, later with migration to the right lower quadrant, abdominal CT scan evidenced the presence of a cecal and pericecal inflammatory process as well as the base and residual proximal portion of the cecal appendix laparoscopic stump appendectomy was performed. Stump appendicitis (SA) is defined as the inflammation of the remnant of the cecal appendix after an appendectomy, whether due to impaction of a fecalith or secondary to an ischemic process, the probability of developing SA is estimated to be about 1/50,000 cases throughout life. The most frequently used treatment is exploratory laparotomy to complete the previous appendectomy; however, there are 5 reported cases of stump appendicitis, where surgical resolution was performed through laparoscopic surgery. It is important to keep this entity in mind when evaluating a patient with acute abdomen with previous history of appendectomy, since the delay in diagnosis and treatment increases morbidity and mortality; laparoscopic stump appendectomy has been shown to be a safe treatment (Agha et al., 2020 [14]).1."

This study aimed to analyze various etiologies that cause peritonitis and shed light on the factors responsible for unsatisfactory results. Method This longitudinal study included 309 patients above 12 years of age, of either gender, with confirmed diagnosis of peritonitis. Exploratory laparotomy was done to identify the cause of peritonitis. Patients were monitored postoperatively till their discharge or death for the development of complications. Results Our results showed that the most common cause of acute peritonitis was duodenal perforation (26.2%), followed by typhoid ileal perforation (24.2%) and ruptured appendix (16.8%). At least one complication was observed in 31% of the participants. The most common complication was dehydration (18.8%), followed by septicemia (11.3%) and paralytic ileus (6.4%). Ten (3.2%) patients died in the hospital. Conclusions Acute peritonitis is a serious surgical emergency caused by a number of diseases. Early surgical treatment along with antibiotics, followed by aggressive resuscitation can yield improved outcomes in patients with peritonitis."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and healthcare costs. The majority of SBOs are caused by adhesions that result from previous surgeries. Bowel obstruction, however, also occurs in patients without previous operation or known pathology, a so called virgin abdomen. It is unknown if small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) can be managed according to the same principles as other cases of small bowel obstruction. The aim of this position paper is to evaluate the available evidence on etiology and management of small bowel obstruction in the virgin abdomen. This is a narrative review with scoping aspects. Clinical topics covered in this review include epidemiology and etiology of SBO-VA, diagnosis and imaging, initial assessment, the role of surgical management in SBO-VA, and the role of non-operative management in SBO-VA. Our scoping search revealed seven original studies reporting original patient data related to SBO-VA. All the included studies are retrospective cohorts, with populations ranging between 44 and 103 patients with SBO-VA. Adhesions were found to be the cause of the obstruction in approximately half of the reported cases of SBO-VA. A relatively high number of cases of SBO-VA were managed surgically with studies reporting 39-83%. However, in cases where a trial of non-operative management was started, this was generally successful. The data available suggest that etiology and treatment results for patients with SBO-VA are largely comparable to the results in patients with SBO after previous abdominal surgery. We therefore propose that patients with a virgin abdomen could be treated according to existing guidelines for SBO and adhesive small bowel obstruction."

    "abstract": "Bochdalek hernia is a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The incidence in adults is estimated around 0.17%. Right-sided hernias are much more seldom than left-sided ones because of faster closure of the right pleuroperitoneal canal and the protective effect of the liver. Due to its rarity, there have been no large prospective or retrospective studies following great need for evidence-based diagnostics and treatment strategies. In this systematic review, we evaluated the current evidence of diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up of adult right-sided Bochdalek hernias. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines a systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed and Cochrane library from 2004 to January 2021. The literature search included all studies with non-traumatic right-sided Bochdalek hernias. Literature on left- or both-sided, pregnancy-associated, pediatric, and other types of hernias were explicitly excluded. Quality assessment of the included studies was performed. Database search identified 401 records. After eligibility screening 41 studies describing 44 cases of right-sided non-traumatic Bochdalek hernias in adulthood were included for final analysis. Based upon the systematic literature review, the current diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up management pathway for this rare surgical emergency is presented. This systematic review underlined that most studies investigating management of adult non-traumatic right-sided Bochdalek hernias are of moderate to low methodological quality. Hernias tend to occur more frequently in middle-aged and older women presenting with abdominal pain and dyspnea. A rapid and accurate diagnosis following surgical repair and regular follow-up is mandatory. High-quality studies focusing on the management of this rare entity are urgently needed."

Patient data for a three-week period was prospectively collected for ESU patients during lockdown period and compared to the ESU workload for the same time period prior to lockdown. Surgical emergencies admissions reduced by 2.5 times during our study period (p value = 0.001). In this changed paradigm, the overall number of surgical emergencies were reduced. A high mortality (n = 4, 5.7%) was noted during lockdown period as compared to pre-lockdown period (n = 1, 0.58%, p value = 0.025). Almost half of surgical admissions were tested for COVID-19 based on their symptoms and more than third (n=14, 38.9%) of them were positive. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common in COVID-19 positive group (85.7%) and only a third (36%) of COVID-19 positive patients needed surgical attention. Chest x-ray findings were comparable to PCR testing in terms of sensitivity and specificity but CT chest was more sensitive. It remains unclear how COVID-19 reduced surgical emergencies.

In this article, we aimed to assess the role of dual-energy CT in locating gastrointestinal perforations, which are among the causes of acute abdomen. Materials and methods All patients who underwent DECT due to acute abdomen in a COVID-19 designated hospital between June 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2020, who were found to have gastrointestinal tract (GIT) perforation and underwent surgery were included in the study. DECT results and intraoperative findings of the patients were compared. Results Thirteen patients (nine males and four females) who underwent DECT for acute abdomen and were diagnosed with perforation in the gastrointestinal system were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 57.6 years (range: 11-85 years). Two patients had gastric perforation, three had duodenal perforations, and one patient had a perforation in the gallbladder wall. Two patients were diagnosed with jejunal perforations, one patient with Meckel's diverticulum, and three patients with colorectal perforation. Although free air was detected in the abdomen of one patient, perforation could not be located. In patients with GIT perforation who were operated on following DECT imaging, the perforation location shown on DECT correlated 100% with the perforation locations detected during surgery. Conclusion DECT is significantly effective in planning surgical treatment and determining the foci of perforation in GIT perforations."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdomen surgery. Despite its commonness and the abundance of literature on the subject, its diagnosis remains challenging. Delay in intervention results in complications of the process leading to increased morbidity and mortality. An observational prospective cohort study was conducted, and all patients who had undergone appendectomy for a clinical diagnosis of appendicitis were included in the study. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23. Half of the study participants were in the age range of 18-25 years with male preponderance (63.9%). The mean duration of symptoms was 51.3 hours. The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (98.2%), while right lower quadrant tenderness was the most common sign (93.4%). Abdominal ultrasound was done in 81% of the study population with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.7% and 33.3%, respectively. Three-quarters (74.4%) of the patients had uncomplicated appendicitis, while 1.8% had a grossly normal appendix. None of the appendectomy specimens were sent for pathology. The mean hospital stay was 3.2 days. The morbidity and mortality rate were 3.8% and 0.4%, respectively. Acute appendicitis was the most common emergency surgical procedure in the study period. Abdominal ultrasound was used in the majority of the patients as supplementary imaging for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Uncomplicated appendicitis took the major share of the intraoperative finding leading to acceptable morbidity and mortality rates."

Diagnosis of ACS can be challenging, as neither clinical symptoms nor signs are sufficiently sensitive. The cardinal symptom associated with ACS is pain reported in excess of what would otherwise be expected for the underlying injury, and not reasonably managed by opioid-based analgesia. Regional anesthesia (RA) techniques are traditionally discouraged in clinical settings where the development of ACS is a concern as sensory and motor nerve blockade may mask symptoms and signs of ACS. This Education article addresses the most common trauma and elective orthopedic surgical procedures in adults with a view towards assessing their respective risk of ACS and offering suggestions regarding the suitability of RA for each type of surgery."

A prospective observational study was performed between March 30, 2020, and June 30, 2020, at a large District General Hospital in England. The primary outcome was perioperative COVID-19-related complications, and secondary outcome measures included incidence of COVID-19 infections among the acute surgical patients, doctors, and healthcare workers. A total of 584 patients admitted through the emergency surgical pathway and 43% (n = 253) underwent surgical intervention. Approximately 5% (n = 30) patients contracted COVID-19 during the perioperative period and 6 of them died. Eight surgical doctors and 11 theater staff were confirmed for COVID-19 by swab test. Acute surgical emergencies and perioperative management of the urgent surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge, but adequate preparedness and strategic plan to adjust the surgical services can reduce the exposures to this highly contagious virus."

    "abstract": "Although ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is classically considered a puerperal pathology, it can also occur in nonpuerperal settings such as endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, Crohn's disease, pelvic or gynaecological surgeries and thrombophilia. Hypercoagulation conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, factor V Leiden and protein C and S deficiency are all recognised risk factors. It is also a known complication during pregnancy often presenting with fever and lower abdominal pain within weeks after delivery. Its incidence is exceedingly rare, occurring in 0.05% of all pregnancies that result in live births and peaking around 2-6 days after delivery. Its preferential involvement of the right ovarian vein may be explained by the compression of the inferior vena cava and the right ovarian vein due to dextrorotation of the uterus during pregnancy. Furthermore, antegrade flow of blood and multiple incompetent valves in the right ovarian vein favours bacterial infection. Complications may include sepsis and thrombus extension to the inferior vena cava or left renal vein and rarely, pulmonary embolism. The authors present the case of a 27-year-old woman with lower abdominal pain 5 weeks after an elective caesarean section. Although the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis was initially considered, a CT suggested a right OVT. She commenced treatment with low-molecular weight heparin. A high index of clinical suspicion is required in order to establish the diagnosis of this rare cause of abdominal pain, which can mimic an acute abdomen."

The hydatidiform mole is the most common form of GTD, representing 80 % of cases. An invasive mole is a hydatidiform mole characterized by the enlarged hydropic villi invading into the myometrium, into vascular spaces, or into extrauterine sites. Here is a case with invasive mole after the evacuation of complete molar pregnancy, presented with an acute abdomen. We desired to preserve the uterine because our 21 years old patient doesn't have a child. An emergency abdominal ultrasound scan showed a 47 ∗ 34 ∗ 55 mm ill-defined hyperechoic heterogeneous mass with anechoic cystic vascular spaces within it, in the posterior wall of the uterus away from the endometrium that extended to the serous layer of the uterus. Laparotomy was done. After the evacuation of 2 L of hemoperitoneum, an approximately 5 × 4 metastatic, vesicular mass was seen in the posterior wall of the uterus, which was resected and uterine preservation was successful. This case report describes the clinical, imaging, surgical and histopathological findings of Invasive mole after a hydatidiform molar pregnancy. Our case highlights the feasibility of fertility-preserving surgery in the case who experienced life-threatening hemorrhage due to a ruptured uterus."

Clinical and laboratory findings led to an appendicitis diagnosis, followed by laparotomy. Normal appendix was found intraoperatively along with an incidental finding of an inflamed and perforated Meckel's diverticulum by chicken bone. Diverticulectomy and enteroanastomosis were performed and the patient had a successful recovery, being discharged after 5 days.

It is a potentially risky surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Its pattern differs from country to country and even from place to place within a country. Therefore, this study aimed to find out the magnitude, pattern and management outcome of intestinal obstruction in Arba Minch General Hospital. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in Arba Minch General hospital from January 09, 2015, to November 09, 2018. The data collection period was from December 15, 2018, to February 09, 2019. A simple random technique was applied to select 801 study participants. Then, the required data entered into Epi Info version 7.2.1.0 and exported to the statistical package for the social sciences software package version 20 for analysis. The binary logistic regression analysis has been done to determine crude statistical associations between independent variables and dependent variables. Linearity, Multivariate normality and multicollinearity were checked between independent and dependent variables by using scatter plot and Q-Q plot respectively. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.25 in the binary logistic regression analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression. Statistical significance factors were identified based on a p-value of < 0.05 and with a 95% confidence interval. This study revealed that the overall magnitude of intestinal obstruction was 40.60% with 95% CI (34.95-45.95). The magnitude of unfavorable management outcomes and deaths during the study period were 22.3% with 95% CI (18.00-27.00) and 7.1% with 95% CI (4.00-10.00) respectively. Persistent tachycardia 10.3 (3.28-32.42), Dehydration 13.7 (3.34-56.56), elevated serum creatinine 10.2 (1.89-54.94), gangrenous small bowel volvulus 2.7 (1.27-5.84), ischemic bowel 3.4 (1.17-9.81) and perforated bowl 7.68 (2.96-19.93) were significantly associated with the management outcome of intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction was the most common among all acute abdomen cases and its management outcome highly associated with dehydration. Adequate early preoperative resuscitation and proper post-operative care with appropriate surgical techniques and wound care with sterile techniques would help to reduce further mortality. This could be achieved by increasing public awareness of health-seeking behavior. Moreover, health facilities capable of handling patients with small bowel obstruction should be available within the reach of the community."

In this case, the spleen is present abnormally in the abdominal or pelvic cavity instead of its normal anatomical location. The aetiology is either congenital or acquired. The condition is caused by the absence or maldevelopment of the spleen's suspensory ligaments, which holds the spleen static in the left hypochondrium. A 27-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and constipation for three days. A palpable movable mass was found during the physical examination, and torsion of the wandering spleen's pedicle was confirmed by CT scan. Open splenectomy was performed, and the patient was recovered uneventfully. Even though ectopic spleen is a rare disease, clinicians should be aware of its incidence. Early diagnosis in the case of an acute abdomen is vital for the preservation of the spleen. Patients presented with acute abdomen and absence of splenic shadow under left hemidiaphragm should be suspected, and further radiological investigation will confirm the diagnosis. Surgery is the gold standard for wandering spleen with either splenopexy or splenectomy, depending on the spleen's condition during surgery."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Less than 300 cases of a De Garengeot's hernia have been published. This rare femoral hernia with the vermiform appendix included appears almost exclusively on the right side, mainly in females, and it generally debuts as an incarcerated femoral hernia. Although most of the times there is a concomitant appendicitis, clinical signs of peritonitis are absent. The wide use of radiologic exams has not favored its preoperative diagnosis, but been usually found incidentally during a surgical emergency. The best surgical approach to a De Garengeot's hernia is not totally defined and many critical questions still remain unanswered. Open surgery is considered the standard treatment procedure, but since the emergence of laparoscopy for incarcerated hernias, this is certainly an option. Methods: We report the successful laparoscopic management of an 83-year-old woman who had been operated on her right inguinal hernia, with a Rutkow-Robbins' technique, 4 months earlier. She had noticed the protrusion of a lump in her right inguinal region for 2 months. Radiological studies were not conclusive. With a miss diagnosis of a recurrent incarcerated inguinal hernia, a minimal invasive endoscopic approach was performed. A representative case of this fully laparoscopic TAPP procedure is presented. Results: The patient made an uninterrupted recovery. She left the hospital the day after in a stable condition and has enjoyed good health since. Conclusion: A fully laparoscopic TAPP approach seems perfectly safe and feasible to treat this entity, and could be considered the first line alternative when enough expertise is available."

We present the case of a two-year-old female who presented to the emergency department in acute distress, pale in complexion, and continuously guarding her abdomen. Physical examination revealed a distended, rigid abdomen with tenderness to palpation of the abdomen in all four quadrants. A computed tomography scan illustrated markedly dilated loops of small bowel but unclear etiology of obstruction with no evidence of perforation. Stat diagnostic laparotomy showed a strangulated internal hernia secondary to a congenital mesenteric defect. The mesenteric defect was repaired laparoscopically, and 25 cm of necrotic bowel was resected with an end-to-end anastomosis. Internal hernias secondary to mesenteric defects are the most common forms of internal hernias in pediatric patients and present with a 100% mortality rate if left untreated. This case illustrates the importance of a high index of suspicion, thorough physical examination, prompt diagnosis, and treatment in preventing a fatal outcome in these patients."

This translates into inadequate care when physicians from vast majority of institutions that do not routinely perform transgender surgery encounter these patients with complications from gender-affirming surgeries. We present a case of a patient who underwent complex multiple gender-affirming surgeries, presenting to our emergency department with an acute abdomen; this resulted in a diagnostic and management dilemma and review of brief pertinent literature.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of the mesenteric veins (IMHMV) is a poorly understood disorder which poses a diagnostic challenge to clinicians and pathologists. Here we have described the case of a male patient with IMHMV along with a presumed history of ulcerative colitis for 1 year. A 55-year-old male presented to the OPD with history of chronic abdominal pain. Clinical and radiological examination coupled with endoscopic findings resulted in the patient being wrongly diagnosed to be a case of ulcerative colitis and was managed accordingly. Throughout his multiple hospital visits following treatment for ulcerative colitis, the patient was persistently symptomatic. He presented with 10 days history of increasing abdominal pain and constipation following which he developed spontaneous colonic perforation for which he underwent exploratory laparotomy left colectomy and Hartman's procedure. The final pathology of the resected colon found to be consistent of Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of the mesenteric veins and ischemic bowel changes. The absence of clear-cut endoscopic biopsy findings of ulcerative colitis made radiological picture to be the mainstay for diagnosis, which was inaccurate and exposed the patient to unnecessary treatment with immuno-modulators thus resulting in poor response to treatment. As the disease progressed, further narrowing of the vessels made the clinical picture to look closer to ischemic bowel pathology as the patient developed a top surgical emergency (i.e. bowel perforation). Such pathological finding (IMHMV) can only be diagnosed in a fully prepared tissue histology, but rather be considered when no other consistent alternative diagnosis was found. The treating physicians must definitely consider the possibility of idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins when similar manifestations are encountered in biopsy specimens of old cases with suspected inflammatory bowel disease or non-occlusive ischemia of the distal colorectum."

    "title": "Large Bowel Ischemia/Infarction: How to Recognize It and Make Differential Diagnosis? A Review.",
    "abstract": "Ischemic colitis represents the most frequent form of intestinal ischemia occurring when there is an acute impairment or chronic reduction in the colonic blood supply, resulting in mucosal ulceration, inflammation, hemorrhage and ischemic necrosis of variable severity. The clinical presentation is variable and nonspecific, so it is often misdiagnosed. The most common etiology is hypoperfusion, almost always associated with generalized atherosclerotic disease. The severity ranges from localized and transient ischemia to transmural necrosis of the bowel wall, becoming a surgical emergency, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis is based on clinical, laboratory suspicion and radiological, endoscopic and histopathological findings. Among the radiological tests, enhanced-CT is the diagnostic investigation of choice. It allows us to make the diagnosis in an appropriate clinical setting, and to define the entity of the ischemia. MR may be adopted in the follow-up in patients with iodine allergy or renal dysfunctions, or younger patients who should avoid radiological exposure. In the majority of cases, supportive therapy is the only required treatment. In this article we review the pathophysiology and the imaging findings of ischemic colitis."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis and surgical treatment are vital in order to preserve the affected gonad. Current surgical teaching emphasizes sudden, severe, persistent, unilateral scrotal pain as a cardinal symptom of testicular torsion. We present the case of unilateral testicular torsion in a 14-year-old patient who presented with the absence of severe pain. Despite a delayed presentation to the emergency department, the gonad could be salvaged successfully. Literature on the topic of testicular torsion presenting with minimal pain is limited. Nevertheless, pediatric surgeons might be faced with cases similar to the one we describe. Underestimating this phenomenon might lead to a delay of treatment. In such cases, ultrasound can be a beneficial addition in the diagnosis and accelerate definitive operative treatment. The presented case clearly demonstrates that, although we do not include testicular torsion without severe pain in our surgical teaching algorithms, we might encounter it in our clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The evisceration of the bowel through the vaginal vault is an extremely rare condition and a surgical emergency with a high-reported mortality rate. Vaginal evisceration most commonly affects menopausal women with a hysterectomy or those with previous vaginal surgery. The most common risk factors include the triad of post-menopausal atrophy, previous vaginal surgery and enterocele. Estrogen deficiency in post-menopausal women leads to weaker pelvic support structures and a thin, atrophic vagina, making it more prone to rupture. Previous vaginal surgery leaves scar tissue with diminished vascularity in the vaginal wall and apex, predisposing it to dehiscence. Post hysterectomy, the axis of the vagina may be changed, making it more vertical or shortened and resulting in the vagina losing its valve-like mechanism. We present a 70-year-old female brought to the emergency department with a vaginal prolapse complicated by bowel evisceration, without any history of vaginal surgery, hysterectomy or trauma. The bowel was inspected and irrigated copiously, then reduced into the abdominal cavity as it was still viable. A total vaginal hysterectomy with an anterior and posterior colporrhaphy was done. The patient had a successful recovery with no complication. We present this case due to its rarity, the absence of previous vaginal surgery, trauma, or hysterectomy and the successful multidisciplinary surgical approach with total recovery. None."

Case Presentation  A 60-year-old woman complained of epigastric swelling for 6 months which gradually increased and became irreducible over the last 2 months. The patient also complained of pain associated with vomiting. Radiological investigations revealed a epigastric hernia with omentum and stomach as content along with fluid collection in the right perihepatic region, with tiny air foci. The patient was explored for the same. Discussion  Perforated peptic ulcer is a serious complication and carries high risk of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis with immediate resuscitation and surgical intervention is essential to improve outcomes. This is a rare case of perforated gastric ulcer which was masked under the complicated ventral hernia."

Diagnosis of STEC-HUS was made with the appearance of bloody diarrhea and renal function impairment, and the clinical picture rapidly progressed to multiorgan failure. Relatively late and severe central nervous system (CNS) involvement was present, characterized by subacute encephalitis progressing to coma, which became apparent when the acute phase of thrombotic microangiopathy was resolving. Therefore, neurologic manifestations were thought to be related to reperfusion damage to the CNS and high-dose IV steroid pulse therapy was empirically administered. Following this therapeutic scheme, neurologic involvement resolved with no sequelae. This case offers several points of discussion on the clinical presentation and the diagnostic approach to STEC-HUS, on the related neurologic complications, and on a novel approach to their management."

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of visits in emergency departments (ED) worldwide decreased significantly based on several studies. This study aims to compare the patient flow in the emergency surgery department during the COVID-19 pandemic and a control period in the emergency department of a public tertiary care hospital in Greece. The overall patient flow reduction regarding the ED visits between the two examined periods was 49.07%. The emergency surgery department's corresponding visits were 235 and 552, respectively, which indicated an overall patient flow decrease of 57.43%. Chi-square analysis showed that age groups and ambulance use had statistically significant associations with the periods examined. An independent samples t-test was applied and deduced that the average patient's age was statistically significantly higher in the COVID-19 pandemic than in the non-pandemic period. By analyzing hospital information system data, useful conclusions can be drawn to prepare a surgical emergency unit better and optimize resource allocation in a healthcare facility in similar critical situations."

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is a lesion of variable severity. It is a rare and difficult to diagnose pathology, it has been found in 0.4% of all traumatized patients and in 1.9% of blunt traumas. It can be associated with abdominal andthoracic lesions, particularly cardiac, which can be life-threatening. Our work is a retrospective case report with a descriptive aim concerning a patient operated for a post-traumatic diaphragmatic rupture within the department of general surgery of CHU Ibn Rochd Casablanca. This work has been reported in line with the SCARE 2020 criteria (17). A 60-year-old patient was admitted to the visceral surgical emergency department following a work accident (crushing between two carts) causing a thoraco-abdominal impact point trauma without initial loss of consciousness, nor externalized digestive hemorrhage or associated signs, but with a general condition alteration. The patient was conscious, dyspneic with a blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg and afebrile. Physical examination showed diffuse abdominal sensibility. The thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan revealed the presence of a left thoracic hernia with gastric, colic and epiploic contents through a lateral defect of the left diaphragmatic dome. The decision was to directly send the patient to the operating room. Exploration found a large left diaphragmatic breach of 20 cm, a denudation of the pericardia, a medium-abundant hemoperitoneum and a hematoma of the right mesocolon. The procedure consisted of right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis, treatment of a diaphragmatic breach with a 2-silk raphia, thoracic drainage with a Joly drain, pericardial drainage with a Joly drain, pre-anastomotic drainage with 2 delbet slides, drainage of the Douglas and left subthreshold with 2 Salem catheters. The post-operative follow-up was simple. Diaphragmatic rupture is a rare and difficult to diagnose condition. Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture (TDR) was found in 0.4% of all traumatized patients and in 1.9% of blunt trauma. Associated lesions of the spleen, liver and/or lungs were found in more than 30% of cases, with an overall mortality rate of 26.8% (1). Pericardial rupture following blunt chest trauma is rare and associated with a high mortality rate ranging from 30% to 64% (9). The physiopathology of this type of injury is not well understood, but the most accepted hypothesis describes an increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to a blunt creating a sufficiently high-pressure gradient between the chest and the abdomen to cause a diaphragmatic rupture. The common clinical symptoms of a diaphragmatic rupture are a marked respiratory distress and diffuse abdominal pain but it can be asymptomatic. Medical imaging exams visualize the ascended organs but it's more difficult to visualize the rupture itself. The chest X-ray is currently the first examination to be requested (4) and also helps in the diagnosis of injuries and diaphragm rupture (13). Surgical treatment includes the reduction of any visceral hernia, repair of the diaphragm and restoration of circulation, breathing and digestive functions. Laparotomy is generally used because of the complete exploration of the abdominal viscera, although it is easier to reduce herniated tissue and repair the diaphragm. Diaphragmatic rupture with denudation of the heart is rare with poor prognosis and requires emergency surgery with close postoperative monitoring in the intensive care setting. Post-traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is a lesion of variable severity. It is a rare and difficult to diagnose pathology, it has been found in 0.4% of all traumatized patients and in 1.9% of blunt traumas. The lesions are more frequent in the left diaphragmatic dome compared to the right one, and exceptionally bilateral. Pericardial rupture following blunt chest trauma is rare and associated to a high mortality rate. It is often unrecognized and goes unnoticed in the acute phase. The most common clinical symptoms of diaphragmatic ruptures are respiratory distress and diffuse abdominal pain, as it can be asymptomatic. Its diagnosis is essentially radiological using CT scan, and requires emergency surgical treatment as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, in order to avoid the dreaded complications. Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We report the case of a patient who presented a post-traumatic diaphragmatic rupture with pericardial damage operated in the visceral emergency department at the Ibn Rochd Hospital c in Casablanca, Morocco."

    "abstract": "A 70-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 3-week history of prolonged fever, asthenia and anorexia, denying other symptoms. Physical examination was unremarkable and the patient admitted for further investigation. Initial laboratory testing showed leucocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein and cholestasis, without hyperbilirubinemia or cytolysis. Abdominal ultrasonography found no abnormalities. Viral serologies, autoimmune tests and blood cultures were collected for further investigation of causes of prolonged fever with hepatic involvement. After two days, Citrobacter koseri was isolated in blood cultures and intravenous (IV) piperacillin-tazobactam initiated. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a left lobe hepatic abscess with gas and a linear hyperdense image, possibly a foreign body, piercing through the gastric antrum into the abscess. Surgical exploration was done for source control. The abscess was drained and the foreign body, a 3.5 cm long fishbone, was removed. The patient's condition rapidly improved. Gastrointestinal perforation due to the ingestion of sharp and elongated foreign bodies usually occur in ileal loops, where the intestinal wall is thinner, causing extravasation of fluids and air into the peritoneum and typically presents with an acute abdomen. The uncommon location of perforation masked these symptoms leading to the unusual presentation with prolonged fever."

Due to its irregular nature, it has the propensity to involve any organ system thus leading to a wide spectrum of clinical features. Most patients affected by TA are females in their second or third decades of lives. Our case is of a 33-year-old male who presented with sudden onset of hypertension for which he was prescribed antihypertensives. Over the next few weeks, he had multiple visits to the emergency department for a variety of different symptoms including fever, myalgias, left arm numbness, and persistence of hypertension. His CT aortogram showed multi-vessel narrowing including that of the celiac axis, superior mesenteric, renal, and internal iliac arteries with right atrophic kidney. At this time, a diagnosis of TA was made and he was started on oral corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy and continued to be treated as an outpatient. Nearly five years after his initial symptoms, he presented to the Emergency for acute abdomen, severe vomiting, and constipation, at which time an emergency laparotomy was done and peritonitis was found. A CT angiogram of the abdomen done after this procedure showed tight stenosis of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and proximal stenosis of the left renal artery. He is currently planned for left renal artery and IMA stenting. Our case highlights the important characteristics of TA in male patients and how they differ from females. It also focuses on the importance of early initial workup and diagnosis and the need for a multi-disciplinary team when handling any patient with TA."

    "abstract": "and importance: Caecal volvulus represents 30% of colonic volvulus. It happens due to torsion or hyperflexion of a hypermobile caecum. Usually it is secondary to an axial rotation of the caecum and the ileum around the mesentery. On the other hand Intestinal malrotation occurs due to incomplete or faulty rotation and fixation of the gut during fetal life. The occurrence of these two anomalies together is scarse which makes this case report interesting. A 75 year old man with medical history of terminal kidney failure, presented to the emergency room with an intestinal obstruction syndrome. On examination the patient had a distended abdomen with tenderness in the left upper quadrant. Biology found an important biological inflammatory syndrome with hyperleukocytosis and elevated CRP. Plain X-ray of the abdomen in erect posture showed an air fluid colonic level in the left hypochondrium. CT scan showed signs of caecal volvulus with intestinal malrotation. A brief reanimation and nasogastric aspiration couldn't solve the problem therefore emergency laparotomy was needed ileocaecal resection was performed associated with LADD's procedure in order to treat both anomalies and prevent further gut volvulus. Despite it's rareness, caecul volvulus represents the second cause of large bowel volvulus just behind sigmoid volvulus. Intestinal malrotation in adults subjects is estimated to occur in 0.2-0.5%.The uniqueness of our case is that these two anomalies were associated in such a way that it made both the diagnosis and the therapy even more difficult. Abdominal CT has become mandatory for pre-operative diagnosis of intestinal volvulus. Surgery is the gold standard treatment for caecal volvulus. The usual options are manual detorsion, carcopexy, caecostomy and colectomy. This case reports a rare association of a caecum volvulus with intestinal malrotation that emphasis the place of modern technologies such as CT scan in order to achieve correct preoperative diagnosis. We also describe our approach to this uncommon surgical emergency in order to provide an efficient treatement."

This report describes the management give to such a child until they were successfully handed over to a cardiac institute. We present a newborn male baby delivered at term to a mother from a low socio-economic background with his heart and abdominal viscera outside the thoracic and abdominal cavity. Despite presenting at a centre without cardiac surgery facilities or cardiologists, they were sustained until referral. Ectopia cordis is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by defect in the fusion of the anterior chest wall resulting in the abnormal extra-thoracic location of the heart.

    "abstract": "Background: During the epidemic, surgeons cannot identify infectious acute abdomen patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) immediately using the current widely applied methods, such as double nucleic acid detection. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model, presented as a nomogram and scale, to identify infectious acute abdomen patients with suspected COVID-19 more effectively and efficiently. Methods: A total of 584 COVID-19 patients and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients were enrolled. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to develop the prediction model. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated through calibration curves, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves in the training and validation cohorts. A simplified screening scale and a management algorithm were generated based on the nomogram. Results: Five potential COVID-19 prediction variables, fever, chest CT, WBC, CRP, and PCT, were selected, all independent predictors of multivariable logistic regression analysis, and the nomogram, named the COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration, and it was validated in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis revealed that the CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified as the CIAAD scale. Conclusion: We established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons in the emergency department to use to distinguish COVID-19 patients. The algorithm based on the CIAAD scale will help surgeons more efficiently manage infectious acute abdomen patients suspected of having COVID-19."

Unless treated, appendicular abscess, perforation, and even death might be the unfavorable outcomes. Hence, this study was aimed to investigate the unfavorable outcomes and associated factors among appendicitis operated patients. A total of 300 patients who operated for appendicitis from September 1 2019 to August 30 2020 were studied using a retrospective cross-sectional study. Data were collected by using a checklist. Epi-data and SPSS version 25 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Binary logistic regression model was used to identify independent factors. A p<0.05 was used to set the statistical significance of factors. Among 300 patients who were operated for acute appendicitis, 36 (12%) developed unfavorable outcomes. Though one death because of sepsis was recorded, wound infection was the main postoperative disorder. Female (AOR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.13-0.074), living outside the hospital setting (AOR= 0.49; 95% CI: 0.13-0.074), duration of illness before arrival at the hospital (1-3 days (AOR= 1.67; 95% CI: 1.34-8.37) and ≥4 days (AOR=5.38; 95% CI: 1.63-7.69)), more than 3 days hospital stay (AOR= 3.21; 95% CI: 2.06-8.10), and mass in the right lower quadrant (AOR= 6.01; 95% CI: 2.11-14.50) were the independent predictors of unfavorable outcomes of appendicitis treatment. In this study, unfavorable outcome of acute appendicitis was high. More than one-tenth of appendicitis cases developed unfavorable outcomes. Living outside the hospital setting area, long duration of illness before arrival at the Hospital, more than 3 days hospital stay, and mass in the right lower quadrant were the risk factors, while females were less likely to have unfavorable outcomes of appendicitis. Therefore, closely working with patients who have abdominal pain and increasing their awareness about acute appendicitis will improve the operation outcome."

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world reacted by implementing curfews and sometimes nation-wide lockdowns intended to control the spread of the disease and help the already overwhelmed healthcare systems from imminent collapse. The Jordanian government was one of those countries that implemented a complete nation-wide lockdown which lasted for 3 months during the peak months of 2020. The aim of this study is to shed the light on the impact of this lockdown on the surgical emergency practice at a tertiary referral center in Amman, the capital of Jordan. A retrospective review of the medical records of the patients who were admitted to the hospital through the emergency department over the lock-down months in 2020 and compare them to the records of the patients admitted within the same period in 2019. A total of 143 patients were admitted in the 2020 group, compared to 201 patients in the 2019 group, marking a 28% reduction in admission rate. The average duration of symptoms before the ER visit was significantly longer in the 2020 period compared to 2019 (95.32 ± 148.62 min, 57 ± 64.4 min respectively, p = 0.01) which resulted in a Significant increase in the ICU admission in the same period (P=.00001). As for the type of management, there was no difference between the two groups with similar percentage of surgeries performed in the two periods (p = 0.333). Additionally, the average length of stay did not also differ (p = 0.141). The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the health care systems around the world to the point of collapse in some countries. This study has demonstrated its effects on the emergency surgery practice at our institution which was mainly related to the delay in getting medical care caused by the strict lock-down laws implemented in the country. Thus, we recommend that special measures should be taken to improve the access to medical care during future events that may require limiting the movement of people and vehicles in the country."

We describe an interesting case of spontaneous perforation of the common bile duct in a 16 year-old female who presented a week after her first birth to the emergency department with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal distention, fever, vomiting, and constipation. She was having generalized peritonitis but the etiology was unclear despite a thorough workup. She underwent exploratory laparotomy, and a perforation in the supra duodenal region of the common bile duct was found intraoperatively. The common bile duct was repaired over T-tube, and cholecystectomy was performed; the patient was recovered uneventfully. Spontaneous biliary perforation is a rare cause of acute abdomen in adults and extremely rare in pregnancy. Its delayed diagnoses and management can lead to a high morbidity and mortality. All physicians, especially surgeons, should be aware of this possibility and consider it a cause of peritonitis on differential diagnosis particularly when there is no apparent etiology available for presentation."

    "title": "The effect of the COVID pandemic lockdown measures on surgical emergencies: experience and lessons learned from a Greek tertiary hospital.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused a rise in healthcare demands leading to significant restructuring of hospital emergency departments worldwide. The aim of the present study is twofold: firstly, to discern any differences in regard to reason for surgical emergency department (SED) attendance and hospital admission during the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras in Greece, and secondly, to assess the impact of the lockdown measures implemented during the pandemic on SED patient attendance. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece (1 March 2020) and up to 15 December 2020, the charts of all adult patients arriving at the SED of the third surgical department of the \"Attikon\" University Hospital (a tertiary referral center for surgical and COVID-19 cases) were retrospectively reviewed and broken down in four periods reflecting two nationwide lockdown (period A 1/3/2020 to 30/4/2020 and period D 16/10/2020 to 15/12/2020) and two interim (period B 1/5/2020 to 15/6/2020 and period C 15/9/2020 to 30/10/2020) periods. Demographic and clinical data were compared to those obtained from the same time periods of the year 2019. The total number of patients attending the SED decreased by 35.9% during the pandemic (from 2839 total patients in 2019 to 1819 in 2020). During the first lockdown, there was statistically significant reduction of motor vehicle accidents (p=0.04) and torso injuries (p=0.01). Contrarily, the rate of head injuries (p<0.001) and abdominal pain (p=0.04) were significantly increased. The same effect was observed regarding the rate of hospital admissions (p=0.002), although in terms of absolute numbers, admissions remained unchanged. During the second lockdown, there was a reduction in the number of perianal abscess cases (p=0.04) and hernia-related problems (p=0.001). An increase in the rate of fall injuries was also demonstrable (p=0.02). Overall, application of the lockdown led to a significant decrease in minor (p<0.001) and torso (p=0.001) injuries. The burden of the new COVID-19 disease has left a noticeable imprint in the function of emergency departments worldwide. In Greece, SED attendance was significantly reduced during the pandemic, an effect that was even more pronounced during the lockdown implementation; nevertheless, the overall rate of hospital admissions remained the same, denoting that patient care was not altered."

    "abstract": "A 64-year-old man was referred to A&E by his general practitioner with worsening back and acute bilateral leg pain and weakness with urinary retention. His MRI scan demonstrated spinal canal stenosis at the level of L1-L2 and a diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome (CES) was made. CES is a rare neurological condition caused by compression of the central spinal nerves at the termination of the cord. CES is a surgical emergency requiring urgent assessment and treatment. The patient underwent urgent surgical decompression; however, he required a second surgery for further decompression as repeat MRI showed persistent stenosis with further extension. Intraoperative Doppler ultrasonography revealed an intradural lesion, which was surgically excised and found to be a sequestrated lumbar disc in the intrathecal space. The patient showed significant neurological improvement post revision decompression."

    "title": "FACTORS AFFECTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT OF APPENDICULAR MASS.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION/ PURPOSE Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in children. Appendicular mass is a relatively common complication in improperly treated patients. The management of appendicular mass remains controversial. This study aims at determining factors affecting the effectiveness of conservative management of appendicular mass. PATIENTS AND METHOD This was a retrospective study of 71 children younger than 15 years with appendicular mass who managed at Basra Children's Specialty Hospital during the period between 2015 and 2019. Factors like age of the patient, duration of symptom prior to hospital admission, size of the mass, complications, hospital stay and outcome are reviewed. RESULTS Appendicular mass complicates 3.9% of all cases of acute appendicitis. Conservative management of appendicular mass was effective in 84.5%. Appendicular mass occurred most frequently in children aged 5-10 year (48%). Male is more frequently affected than female with a ratio of 1.4. Regarding age effect on the efficacy of conservative management of appendicular mass, there is a significant association with P-value = 0.017. Duration of symptoms or size of the mass has no significant association with the success of conservative management. No mortality or major surgical complications are encountered. Although effective, conservative management prolong the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION I concluded that conservative management of appendicular mass in children should be revised particularly in children younger than 5 years old, wherein operative treatment may be the first option. The reasons for that are high rate of failure of conservative management with early progress to appendicular abscess. These could be explained by the underdevelopment of greater omentum and so lacking of its protective effect in limiting the spread of inflammation. In addition, early appendectomy has the advantage of decreased risk of adhesive intestinal obstruction, shortening of hospital stay (so that less economic burden), and avoidance of second readmission for interval appendectomy."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a surgical emergency with a high mortality rate if left untreated. Management of the aortic root in this setting constitutes an intricate decision-making framework, further complicated by the emergent nature of the dissection. There exists much controversy regarding pursuit of the aggressive aortic root replacement versus a conservative root-sparing repair, alongside considerations for valve-sparing root replacement. In this review, we critically appraise the current controversy in the literature considering the fate of the aortic root, discussing the aforementioned root interventions for which provides better outcomes for mortality and risk of re-intervention. Literature search was performed using electronic database through PubMed, Google scholar, and Embase focussing on studies reporting outcomes and re-intervention rates for these approaches. Limited by the heterogeneity in surgical strategy, with most studies being single-centred retrospective experiences, further fuel this ongoing debate. The literature reveals rather contrasting results whilst comparing root-sparing repair, versus the extensive root replacement; whilst some studies report no statistically significant difference, others show one superior over the other. There is greater consensus when considering risk of re-operation, with studies showing higher rates of re-operation in root-sparing group compared to replacement; however, many others show no statistically significant difference. In conclusion, the conflicting outcomes reported in the literature, with their inherent limitations, results in the current inability to reach a definitive answer. There remains support in the current literature for both approaches with much of the decision-making being surgeon-bound with many significant influencing factors on a case-by-case basis."

In this situation a misleading diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum may occur. The authors are going to present a case of a 79-year-old man with an asymptomatic pneumoperitoneum incidentally detected by CT-scan and subsequently revealed to be pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) at diagnostic laparoscopy. PCI is a rare condition characterized by the presence of gas-filled cyst in the submucosa/subserosa of the bowel wall that can easily mimic pneumoperitoneum on radiological imaging.

Therefore, ACS is a surgical emergency and if not treated immediately, permanent neurovascular and muscular compromise can ensue. When compartment syndrome is suspected, clinical recognition and timely assessment of the limb is essential to preventing limb ischemia. The classic cause of ACS is trauma; however, coagulopathies have been known to incite these events. Hemorrhage into a compartment can cause ACS but is rare in the literature. Here we present a case of thrombophilia resulting from pathological liver disease, leading to ACS that ultimately led to limb exsanguination.

In this report, we discuss our decision-making process for diagnosis and treatment in case with unexpected postoperative new-onset atrial fibrillation causing acute mesenteric ischemia. A 78-year-old male patient received varicose vein stripping and ligation in his right leg. The patient was previously healthy with no known comorbidities. The next day after surgery, he complained of sudden epigastric pain unresponsive to conservative treatment, and new-onset atrial fibrillation was observed on electrocardiography. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed acute embolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Emergent surgical embolectomy was performed successfully. The time to operation from the recognition of abdominal pain was 6 h. Surgical critical care was performed for life-threatening ischemic reperfusion injury. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 40th postoperative day. Atypical postoperative abdominal pain unresponsive to conservative treatment should be considered a surgical emergency, and a high level of clinical suspicion for acute mesenteric ischemia is required. Preoperative electrocardiography and postoperative telemetry might be helpful in some asymptomatic patients."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency which can lead to bowel necrosis, perforation and death. Plain abdominal X-rays are frequently used as a first-line test but the availability of immediate expert radiological review is variable. The aim was to investigate the feasibility of using a deep learning model for automated identification of small bowel obstruction. A total of 990 plain abdominal radiographs were collected, 445 with normal findings and 445 demonstrating small bowel obstruction. The images were labelled using the radiology reports, subsequent CT scans, surgical operation notes and enhanced radiological review. The data were used to develop a predictive model comprising an ensemble of five convolutional neural networks trained using transfer learning. The performance of the model was excellent with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.961, corresponding to sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 93% respectively. Deep learning can be used to identify small bowel obstruction on plain radiographs with a high degree of accuracy. A system such as this could be used to alert clinicians to the presence of urgent findings with the potential for expedited clinical review and improved patient outcomes. This paper describes a novel labelling method using composite clinical follow-up and demonstrates that ensemble models can be used effectively in medical imaging tasks. It also provides evidence that deep learning methods can be used to identify small bowel obstruction with high accuracy."

This retrospective study included 18 patients admitted with acute colon perforation and who received surgical treatment. Age of patients ranged between 1 month and 15 years. Five patients swallowed foreign objects (two swallowed magnets), two had colon perforation secondary to a malignant tumor (both colorectal adenocarcinoma) and two were iatrogenic (one prior colonoscopy, one air enema for intussusception). There was one perforation due to chemotherapy and Amyand's hernia respectively. The remaining seven patients had unknown etiologies; five of them were diagnosed with colitis. Fifteen (83.3 %) patients underwent open laparotomy, among which four attempted laparoscopy first. Three (16.7 %) patients underwent laparoscopic surgery. Fourteen (77.8 %) patients received simple suture repairs and four (22.2 %) received colonic resections and anastomosis. Four (22.2 %) patients received a protective diverting colostomy and three (16.7 %) received an ileostomy.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, regardless of age, is the gold standard for this disease, but the optimal timing of surgical intervention is an open issue since the 2007 Tokyo guidelines. We recruited from March 2015 to June 2018, in a retrospective study, 144 patients with acute cholecystitis and treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients were divided into two groups: group A (N.=66), operated within 72 hours and group B (N.=78), between 72 hours and 1 week after the onset of symptoms. After, the two groups were further stratified by the grade of severity of acute cholecystitis in according to the Tokyo guidelines: in group A, 39 patients were grade I and 27 grade II; in group B, 48 patients were grade I and 30 grade II. The operative time was longer in group B patients versus group A. In group B, there was a greater difficulty in dissecting and detecting the Calot's triangle, more conversions to open, a greater mean length of hospital stay and more post-operative days. In patients with grade II, especially in the group B, were greater inflammation stage, conversions to open, difficulty in the dissection of the Calot's triangle, mean length of hospital stay and post-operative days. The operative timing within 72 hours in patients with grade I, have only advantage in the mean length of hospital stay, while in grade II, the advantages are also in the lesser difficulty in dissecting the Calot's triangle, fewer conversions and fewer post-operative days. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis should be performed considering not only the onset of symptoms, but above all the grade of severity of AC in according with TG.

In our report, we present the case of a 27-years old male presenting with a hemoperitoneum due to ruptured middle colic artery with no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or any other pathology. The patient's hemodynamic status deteriorated abruptly requiring a damage control exploratory laparotomy for evacuation of the hemoperitoneum, ligation of the middle colic artery and transverse colectomy. The post-operative course was uneventful afterwards and the patient was discharged a week after presentation with full recovery. Patients with ISIH might exhibit the \"double rupture\" phenomenon, compromising their hemodynamic stability and necessitating urgent surgical interventions. CTA can be of paramount importance to guide such interventions if the patient's clinical status permits. Angiographic embolization is an acceptable alternative approach in specific situations. ISIH should be on the differential diagnosis of any young patient presenting to the ED with an acute abdomen, regardless of the identifiable risk factors."

We present a case series where patients with early flexor tenosynovitis are managed using a limited flexor sheath incision and drainage (I&D) in the emergency department (ED) to both confirm purulence within the flexor sheath and as definitive treatment. A retrospective study of all patients clinically diagnosed in the ED with flexor tenosynovitis at our institution from 2012 to 2019 was performed. Patients with frank purulence on examination were taken emergently to the operating room (OR). Patients with equivocal findings underwent limited flexor sheath I&D in the ED. Safety and efficacy were studied for patients with early flexor tenosynovitis managed with this treatment approach. Thirty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Ten patients underwent direct OR I&D, and 24 patients underwent ED I&D. In the ED I&D group, 96% (24 of 25) of patients did not have frank purulence in the flexor sheath and were managed with bedside drainage alone. There were no procedural complications and no need for repeat operative intervention. Time to intervention (3.1 hours vs 8.4 hours) was significantly shorter for the ED I&D group compared with the OR I&D group. Within the ED I&D group, 86% of patients exhibited good/excellent functional scores.

The most extreme expression of cervical insufficiency is known as \"hourglass membranes\". Currently no consensus exists regarding the treatment of pregnancies complicated by the protrusion of amniotic membranes; however, the majority of authors agree on recommending bed rest and performing cervical cerclage, known as \"emergent cerclage.\" We describe a series of clinical cases corresponding to second-trimester pregnancies with cervical dilation and prolapsed amniotic membranes that were admitted to our hospital, managed with conservative treatment. All patients received the same basic treatment: intravenous fluid therapy for hydration, a single-oral-dose of azithromycin and intravenous antibiotic therapy for 7 days, vaginal micronized progesterone and indomethacin administrated orally. Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 22.5 weeks with an extension of pregnancy between 2.1 and 16 weeks, with eight patients (72.72%) who extended their pregnancy for more than 8 weeks. In all cases, live fetuses were obtained, with favorable evolution. Despite our limited experience, resulting from the low number of cases presenting, our results encourage us to propose conservative management in pregnancies complicated with a dilated cervix and membranes protruding into the vagina, as a reasonable alternative to surgical emergency cervical cerclage, which is currently considered the therapy of choice when extreme cervical shortening occurs in the second trimester of pregnancy."

In certain patients, however, treatment is futile and early palliative care, lessens patient, and family distress. The aim of this study was to investigate factors, focusing on patient comorbidity, that may predict futility of treatment and hence, guide clinicians in their decision making. Consecutive adult patients with AMI diagnosed on imaging were reviewed for demographics, comorbidity, imaging, and biochemical results. Seventy patients were identified with average age of 67 (range 33 - 94). Overall hospital mortality was 72%. Patients were divided into three distinct groups, patients who recovered (27%), patients deceased despite surgical treatment (18%), and patients palliated on presentation (54%). Age was comparable between groups (61 vs. 69 vs. 69; p=.2). Length of stay was highest in the recovered group (41.6 vs. 12.3 vs. 2.8 d). Biochemically, only lactate level differed (3.1 vs. 2.3 vs. 5.3 mmol/L, p=.03). Both deceased and palliative group scored similarly but significantly higher than the recovered group in both the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (4.2 and 5.6 vs. 3.4, p=.02) and age-adjusted CCI (ACCI) (6.7 and 8.2 vs. 5; p<.01). Other co-morbidities of atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension were comparable. Raised ACCI confers poor outcomes in AMI despite surgical management. ACCI may be used to aid early decision making in AMI, predicting futility of treatment, and altering management goals to palliative comfort care."

A total of 3475 patients were included: 3135 in open group (OG), 340 (~10%) in laparoscopic group (LG). After PSM to control for comorbidities and illness severity that differed between groups on univariate analysis, 288 patients remained in each group. Analysis of the matched cohorts revealed no statistically significant difference in mortality (5.9% OG versus 3.8% LG, P = 0.245). The LG had significantly longer operative times (92 versus 79 min, P = 0.003), shorter hospital stays (8.2 versus 9.4 d, P = 0.044) and higher probability of being discharged home (81% versus 73%, P = 0.017). 30POP outcomes were largely equivalent, except that OG had higher risk for bleeding (14.6% versus 8%, P = 0.012) and pneumonia (8.7% versus 4.5%, P = 0.044). While laparoscopic repairs take longer, they lead to shorter hospital stays and higher likelihood of discharge home. Further study to identify patients that are candidates for this technique is warranted."

    "abstract": "Acute gastric volvulus is a surgical emergency with a mortality as high as 15-20%. The rarity of gastric volvulus requires high index of clinical suspicion especially in the patients with altered anatomy, to allow immediate surgical intervention and reduce the morbidity and mortality. We present an unusual case of gastric remnant volvulus several months following Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy performed in an obese patient for severe, recurrent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and failed prior fundoplication. The patient was treated with gastropexy and Stamm gastrostomy tube. Gastric volvulus is a rare phenomenon, in which the stomach rotates around the short (mesentero-axial) or longitudinal (organo-axial) axes. Diagnosis of gastric volvulus is challenging due to non-specific presentation and rarity of this clinical condition. The diagnosis of volvulus in patients with altered anatomy is even more challenging, requiring a high index of suspicion, and heavily relies on cross sectional imaging. Extensive gastric mobilization is a key step in several foregut and bariatric surgeries, this will leave the stomach with no attachments posteriorly and along the greater curvature and increases the likelihood of volvulus."

    "abstract": "Pediatric airway foreign bodies (FBs) are a surgical emergency, and peanuts and tree nuts (PN/TNs) can pose a significant aspiration risk in young children. In 2015, the Learning Early About Peanut allergy (LEAP) trial established that early introduction of peanuts in high-risk infants reduced the risk of developing a peanut allergy. Infant feeding guidelines were subsequently modified to actively encourage the introduction of allergenic foods for all infants. The impact of this shift in feeding advice on the incidence of PN/TN inhalation has not been previously studied. To determine the incidence of PN/TN inhalation presentations to a quaternary pediatric hospital between 2008 and 2018. A retrospective cohort study of children who were diagnosed with an airway FB by rigid bronchoscopy. There were 200 cases of FB inhalation (35% PN/TN, 34% other foods, and 31% inorganic material). There was a rise in the total incidence of FB inhalation over the study period (incidence ratio rate [IRR], 1.09; P < .001). The rise was due to PN/TN (IRR, 1.16; P < .002) and other food inhalation (IRR, 1.12; P = .01), with no significant increase in inorganic FB aspiration (IRR, 1; P = .94). Between pre-LEAP (2008-2014) and post-LEAP (2015-2018) periods, there was a trebling, doubling, and no increase in the rate of PN/TN, other food, and inorganic FB inhalation, respectively. Since the publication of the LEAP study, there has been a rise in PN/TN and other hard solid food inhalation at our institution. This study highlights the urgent need to engage the public to promote safe introduction of hard foods in young children."

Nasopharyngeal swab was done as a prerequisite for admission or prior to admission as part of random testing. Two methods of viral testing were employed: Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (rapid test) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Either or both tests were done, with the former performed for patients requiring surgery immediately. Surgery was performed within 24-36 h from admission. Peritoneal fluid swabs were obtained for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR test. Swabs were immediately placed in viral transfer media and delivered to the public health laboratory in an ice bag. SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in peritoneal swabs. Due to the limited number of patients, further studies are required; yet, protective measures should still be taken by surgeons when dealing with COVID-19 cases."

PPs are developed as a complication caused in patients, suffering from mainly thee conditions. Firstly, PPs appear in patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), they are also developed in patients with peritoneal trauma and finally in CD patients. Our case belongs to these three reported cases in our literature review, since it refers to a CD patient that developed PPs. He underwent emergency laparotomy and excision of the cyst, with good postoperative results. A literature review of 22 publications show that PPs often represent a diagnostic and therapeutic problem as it has a variable presentation and there are no data on what the best treatment option is - surgical excision or aspiration."

We reported the case of a 6-year-old child presented with acute abdomen and then diagnosed with MIS-C. In addition, to better portray this new entity, we performed a systematic review of MIS-C gastrointestinal features and particularly on those mimicking surgical emergencies. We described the clinical presentation, the diagnostic approach and the therapeutic outcomes of our MIS-C patient. Parallel to this, we conducted a systematic literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, focusing on gastrointestinal MIS-C. Our patient was initially assessed by the surgical team due to his query acute abdomen. Following the diagnosis of MIS-C with myocarditis, intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/Kg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulins (2 gr/Kg single infusion) were promptly started, leading to clinical improvement. According to our literature search, patients with MIS-C have a high rate of severe abdominal symptoms resembling surgical emergencies (appendicitis, obstruction, etc.) and a not negligible number of those patients have been surgically explored with variable findings. We encourage pediatric surgeons in the upcoming months of COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate myocardial function prior to surgical abdominal exploration. In children with query acute abdomen, MIS-C should be promptly ruled out in order to avoid unnecessary surgeries that could worsen the already frail outcome of this new syndrome. Nevertheless, it should be considered that MIS-C might well encompass complications (e.g. appendicitis, segmental intestinal ischemia) which need swift surgical treatment."

This study compared the outcomes and characteristics of the ACS system and traditional on-call system (TROS) for acute appendicitis in South Korea. This single-center, retrospective study included all patients (aged ≥18 years) who underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in 2016 and 2018. The TROS and ACS system were used for the 2016 and 2018 groups, respectively. We retrospectively obtained data on each patient from the electrical medical records. The independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used for continuous and nonnormally distributed data, respectively. In total, 126 patients were included. The time taken to get from the emergency room admission to the operating room, operation times, and postoperative complication rates were similar between both groups. However, the length of the hospital stay was shorter in the ACS group than in the TROS group (4.3 ± 3.2 days vs. 7.2 ± 9.6 days, p=0.039). Since the introduction of the ACS system, the length of hospital stay for surgical patients has decreased. This may be due to the application of an integrated medical procedure, such as a new clinical pathway, rather than differences in the surgical techniques."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency, and time to detorsion is imperative for testicular salvage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may delay emergency care due to stay-at-home orders and concern of COVID-19 exposure. To assess whether emergency presentation for testicular torsion was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the rate of orchiectomy increased compared to a retrospective period. Patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study from seven institutions in the United States and Canada. Inclusion criteria were patients two months to 18 years of age with acute testicular torsion from March through July 2020. The retrospective group included patients from January 2019 through February 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression. A total of 221 patients were included: 84 patients in the COVID-19 cohort and 137 in the retrospective cohort. Median times from symptom onset to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 compared to the retrospective period were 17.9 h (IQR 5.5-48.0) and 7.5 h (IQR 4.0-28.0) respectively (p = 0.04). In the COVID-19 cohort, 42% of patients underwent orchiectomy compared to 29% of pre-pandemic controls (p = 0.06). During COVID-19, 46% of patients endorsed delay in presentation compared to 33% in the retrospective group (p = 0.04). We found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a higher proportion of patients reported delaying care. Strengths of the study include the number of included patients and the multicenter prospective design during the pandemic. Limitations include a retrospective pre-pandemic comparison group. In a large multicenter study we found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a significantly higher proportion of patients reported delaying care. Based on the findings of this study, more patient education is needed on the management of testicular torsion during a pandemic."

For many patients, parenteral nutrition (PN) is the only feeding option available. The present study assessed the timing and outcomes of this decision-making process. A sample of at least 10 consecutive adult patients admitted as a general surgical emergency to eight UK hospitals over 1 year who had received PN was identified. Patient demographics, basic descriptors and nutritional data were captured. Process measures regarding dates decisions were made or activities completed were extracted from records, as were outcome measures including PN complications. Six time frames examining the process of PN delivery were analysed. Associations between categorical and binary variables were investigated with a chi-squared test with significance determined as p < 0.05. In total, 125 patients were included. Intestinal obstruction was the most common diagnosis with 59% of all patients deemed high risk on nutritional assessment at admission. Median time to decision for PN was 5 days following admission (n = 122, interquartile range = 7). Patients received PN for a mean of 11 days. Eighty-five percent of patients developed a complication, with a phosphate abnormality being the most commonly reported (54%). Only altered blood glucose levels appeared to correlate with a delay in starting PN (p < 0.01). The present study shows there are delays in the decision to use PN in the acutely ill surgical patient. Once initiated, the pathway is relatively short. There are high rates of electrolyte abnormalities in this population."

    "abstract": "Visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) are associated with a very high mortality rate when ruptured and may present as a surgical emergency. Due to their rarity and varying pathophysiology, literature concerning the optimal management of VAAs is limited. This review evaluates the evolving management options for VAAs with a focus on open and endovascular repair. A combination of databases including OVID, PubMed and Medline were used to perform a literature search. Search terms employed include 'visceral artery aneurysms', 'angiography', '3D-volumetric rendering', 'management', 'open repair' and 'endovascular repair', amongst others. 3D modelling in conjunction with existing diagnostic techniques, such as computed tomography and angiography, may improve diagnostic sensitivity. The literature surrounding operative management of VAAs highlights the effectiveness of endovascular repair for anatomically suitable aneurysms. Advances in endovascular technologies may expand the type and number of aneurysms amenable to catheter-based treatment approaches. For aneurysms not amenable to endovascular treatment, or those with an emergency indication, open repair remains an appropriate management choice. Although rare, VAAs pose a high mortality risk, especially when ruptured. Practical limitations that restrict current operative approaches may be overcome by recent developments including novel neurointerventional techniques that have been applied in VAA management."

The definitive diagnosis was made intraoperatively, by means of an emergent ileal resection with primary anastomosis, which confirmed Meckel's diverticulitis. Postoperative evolution was ordinary. The association of COVID-19 with the acute abdomen is found to be weak, therefore surgical consultation is advised to minimize delayed treatment."

A retrospective study of emergency hospitalizations with a diagnosis of acute surgical abdomen between April and July 2020 vs. a similar period in 2019 was performed. The observation sheets and the operating protocols were analyzed. Between April and July 2020, 50 cases of acute surgical abdomen were hospitalized and treated, compared to 43 cases in the same period last year. The main types of pathology in both groups included: Occlusions (60%, respectively 44.2% in 2019) and peritonitis (32%, respectively 41.8% in 2019). There was an increased rate of patients with colorectal cancers neglected therapeutically or uninvestigated, who presented during the pandemic period with emergencies for complications such as occlusion or tumor perforation (32 vs. 6.97%, P=0.0039). One case, with gastric perforation, was COVID-positive, with no pulmonary symptoms at admission. The number of postoperative infectious complications was lower during the pandemic (2 vs. 13.95%, P=0.0461). As the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be still far from ending, we should learn to adapt our surgical protocols to the new evidence. Oncological patients are a vulnerable group, who were neglected in the first months of the pandemic. SARS-Cov-2 infection may be a cause of abdominal pain and should be taken into account in different diagnoses of acute abdomen in surgical wards. Correct wearing of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and respecting strict rules of asepsis and antisepsis are required for preventing in-hospital transmission of infection."

In this observational cohort study, we aim to investigate the factors affecting patient outcomes in acute appendicitis at a rural hospital. This observational cohort study was held between November 2012 and May 2014 at a rural hospital. Patients' pre-operative, perioperative, and post-operative data were collected prospectively. Patients were followed-up for 12-months. A total of 151 patients were recorded. Factors significantly associated with complicated cases (abscess/perforation) were referral region as remote towns (OR:7.94, 95%CI [3.46-18.23]; p < 0.001), referral season as winter (OR:2.47, %95CI [1.14-5.36]; p = 0.022), pre-operative hospital delay (OR:6.52, 95%CI [3.49-12.20]; p < 0.001), and duration of referral (OR:1.01, 95%CI [1.00-1.01]; p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, only pre-operative hospital delay remained as a significant factor (OR:5.87, 95%CI [2.85 - 12.07]; p < 0.001). Factors affecting length of hospital stay (LoHS) were referral region as remote towns (95%CI, β = 3.10 [2.28-3.93], t = 1.91; p < 0.001), abscess/perforation (95%CI, β = 4.70 [4.04-5.36], t = 14.05; p < 0.001), pre-operative hospital delay (95%CI, β = 1.25 [0.87-1.62], t = 6.58; p < 0.001), and duration of referral (95%CI, β = 0.011 [0.01-0.14], t = 7.34; p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, all four factors stayed significant. The rate of complicated appendicitis was significantly high in winter than other seasons for patients referring from remote towns (75% vs 33%, p < 0.001). This observational cohort study is the only study specifically focused on the effect of season and region on abscess/perforation rates, LoHS, and accessibility to hospital in patients with acute appendicitis."

Imaging studies revealed splenic infarcts and ground-glass opacities in bilateral pulmonary bases. He was treated with full-dose anticoagulation and was discharged home on oral Rivaroxaban. Although rare in the literature, cases of acute abdomen in COVID-19 patients associated with vascular infarctions have increased. Coagulopathy may be present even without clinical respiratory manifestations of the disease. Patients meeting disseminated intravascular coagulation criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant therapy.

Our series included 18 cases of FG collected over an 18-year period, an annual incidence of one case per year. The average age of our patients was 58 years (36 to 77). The male prevalence was clear. Diabetes and old age were found to be the major risk factors.

The vaccum assisted closure (VAC) therapy is also used, which is a non-invasive system that promotes open wound healing. Healing techniques can be once the septic risk is controlled. Dressings topical treatments, such as fatty substances or calcium alginate, in addition to skin grafts, musculo-neurotic or musculo-cutaneous cover flaps can be used. During the follow-up period, no reccurrence occurred in 14 out of the 18 cases (2 patients were lost to follow-up and 2 patients died). A colostomy was closed in 10 out of 11 cases with simple follow-ups. Restorative surgery (partial thickness skin graft) at the perineal level was performed in only one case. Despite the better understanding of its etiopathogenesis, the advent of targeted antibiotic therapy, the establishment of a better codification of surgical procedures, the contribution of hyperbaric oxygenation and reconstruction techniques, mortality rates are still high and FG remains a real health threat, thus constituting a real medical and surgical emergency."

Late complications after this intervention, such as erosion of the aorta or the atria, are rare and have not been sufficiently approached and dealt with in literature. In our clinic we have been faced with the problematic situation of diagnosing and treating such cases. That is why, we have decided to share our experience with other colleagues. We present two cases of severe late complications after percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects (ASD). In both cases, the atrial septal occluder (Amplatzer™ Atrial Septal Occluder Device, Abbott, Chicago USA) caused the erosion between the left atrium and the aortic root. The atrio-aortic erosion led to acute cardiac tamponade with upper venous congestion and shock. As the bleeding source remained undetectable for any imaging tools, a diagnostical sternotomy remained the only solution. The cause of the acute bleeding was discovered to be the erosion between the left atrium and the aortic root. The treatment consisted in the removal of the occluder, direct suturing of the perforated areas and the surgical closure of the remaining ASD. The patients fully recovered within the nine to fourteen days' hospital stay. Six months after surgery both patients were well and able to recover their daily routine. The atrio-aortic erosion after percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects is a surgical emergency. The more so, since it can be complicated by the absence of specific symptoms. A key-element in the diagnosis of this rare pathology remains the medical history of the patient, which the surgeon has to consider thoroughly and launch the diagnostic sternotomy without delay."

Associated amputation rates for all popliteal artery (PA) injuries range between 10 and 50%. It is unclear whether PA repair or bone stabilization should be performed first. We analyzed (long-term) clinical outcomes of BPAI patients that received initial PA repair (vessel-first, VF) versus initial external stabilization (bone-first, BF). Retrospectively, all surgically treated BPAI patients between January 2000 and January 2019, admitted to two level 1 trauma centers were included. Clinical outcomes were determined, stratified by initial management strategy (VF and BF). Treatment strategy was determined by surgeon preference, based on associated injuries and ischemia duration. Primary outcomes (amputation and mortality) and secondary outcomes (claudication and complications) were determined. Of 27 included BPAI patients, 15 were treated according to the VF strategy (56%) and 12 according to the BF strategy (44%). Occlusion was the most frequently encountered BPAI in 18/27 patients (67%). Total delay and in-hospital delay were comparable between groups (p = 1.00 and p = 0.82). Revascularization was most frequently performed by PA bypass (59%). All patients had primary limb salvage during admission (100%). One secondary amputation due to knee pain was performed in the BF group (4%). During a median clinical follow-up period of 2.7 years, three PA re-interventions were performed, two in the BF group and one in the VF group. None suffered from (intermittent) claudication. Blunt popliteal artery injury (BPAI) is a rare surgical emergency. Long-term outcomes of early revascularization for BPAI appear to be good, independent of initial management strategy. The BF strategy may be preferred in case of severe orthopedic injury, if allowed by total ischemia duration."

    "abstract": "We describe here the first laparotomy involving a COVID-19 patient in Malaysia. A 60-year-old man screened positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020 and developed acute abdomen in the ward in Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Kedah. He underwent laparotomy and cholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. All personnel adhered to infectious control precautions, donning full personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the surgery. Post-operatively, due to raised septic parameters, he was carefully diagnosed with and treated empirically for superimposed bacterial sepsis instead of cytokine release syndrome, with confirmed blood culture of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Patient was discharged well later. None of the staff involved in his care developed COVID-19 infection."

    "abstract": "Septic arthritis in children is considered an orthopedic surgical emergency, which requires prompt intervention to prevent later sequela. In the last decades, several minimal invasive techniques were suggested as an alternative to the standard treatment of septic arthritis in the pediatric hip via open arthrotomy. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a new minimal invasive technique-double luminal catheter drainage (DLDC)-in treating septic hip arthritis in children. Retrospective case series analysis was performed on all patients 1-18 years of age diagnosed with septic hip arthritis and treated by the new suggested minimal invasive technique between the years 2009-2019 at medium-sized medical center. Five patients were treated by DLDC with a follow-up period of 12 months posttreatment. The diagnosis was based on joint aspirated fluid analysis criteria. During the follow-up period, no later sequel, including avascular necrosis, or infection recurrence were observed. The new minimal invasive treatment technique suggested in this study seems to be efficient and safe in treating septic hip arthritis in children without later sequela or the need for open arthrotomy, especially if performed early on. However, due to the small study sample, no generalization of the findings can be made as future studies with larger study samples are needed to validate the DLDC technique."

A number of unusual presentations and complications of dengue fever have been reported, and acute abdomen is one such presentation. However, intussusception as the cause of acute abdomen in a patient with dengue haemorrhagic fever has not been previously reported. The authors report a child who was diagnosed to have intussusception during the critical phase of dengue haemorrhagic fever while having a platelet count of 15×103/cumm. The child had initial point-of-care ultrasound followed by detailed ultrasound of the abdomen by the radiologist, and the diagnosis of ileocaecal intussusception was confirmed. Intussusception was relieved by saline reduction and without needing laparotomy. Early diagnosis and non-operative management prevented emergency laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Omental infarction is a rare cause of an acute abdomen with nonspecific signs that can be easily mistaken with other more common intra-abdominal pathologies. The increased use of radiological imaging has brought this diagnosis to attention with respect to management plan. We present the experience of an Australian hospital network with the diagnosis and management of omental infarction to raise awareness of this uncommon pathology. A retrospective review of medical records of adult patients diagnosed with omental infarction from 2010 to 2020 was conducted across four major hospitals in South Western Sydney. Data relating to clinical presentation, investigations, management and outcomes were obtained. Omental infarction was diagnosed in 61 patients (mean 51.1 years, range: 19-76 years old). All patients presented with nonspecific abdominal pain with the most common sites being the right iliac fossa followed by the right upper quadrant, respectively, over an average period of 2.7 days. Computed tomography and/or diagnostic laparoscopy identified omental infarction in all cases. Forty-two patients (68.9%) had successful conservative management, six failed conservative management and 19 patients had emergency laparoscopic omentectomy. The average hospital length of stay was 3.4 days with no significant morbidity or mortality. Omental infarction generally presents with nonspecific clinical signs often masquerading as other more common abdominal diagnosis like cholecystitis or appendicitis. A trial of conservative management initially coupled with appropriate imaging should be recommended within the first 24-48 h before considering surgical treatment in refractory cases."

However, measures for prevention and treatment options are based on a single surgeon´s experiences and small case series in the literature. Retrospective single-center analysis on patients who underwent surgical repair of trans-hiatal hernia following gastrectomy or esophagectomy from 01/2003 to 07/2020 regarding clinical symptoms, hernia characteristics, pre-operative imaging, hernia repair technique and perioperative outcome. Trans-hiatal hernia repair was performed in 9 patients following abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy (40.9%), in 8 patients following trans-hiatal esophagectomy (36.4%) and in 5 patients following conventional gastrectomy (22.7%). Gastrointestinal symptoms with bowel obstruction and pain were mostly prevalent (63.6 and 59.1%, respectively), two patients were asymptomatic. Transverse colon (54.5%) and small intestine (77.3%) most frequently prolapsed into the left chest after esophagectomy (88.2%) and into the dorsal mediastinum after gastrectomy (60.0%). Half of the patients had signs of incarceration in pre-operative imaging, 10 patients underwent emergency surgery. However, bowel resection was only necessary in one patient. Hernia repair was performed by suture cruroplasty without (n = 12) or with mesh reinforcement (n = 5) or tension-free mesh interposition (n = 5). Postoperative pleural complications were most frequently observed, especially in patients who underwent any kind of mesh repair. Three patients developed recurrency, of whom two underwent again surgical repair. Trans-hiatal herniation after esophago-gastric surgery is rare but relevant. The role of surgical repair in asymptomatic patients is disputed. However, early hernia repair prevents patients from severe complications. Measures for prevention and adequate closure techniques are not yet defined."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute compartment syndrome represents a surgical emergency to restore blood supply by fasciotomy and decompression. Compartment syndrome is most commonly associated with crush-related injuries and fractures; however, other non-traumatic etiologies can occur. This report illustrates a rare case of acute atraumatic compartment syndrome of the upper extremity due to Streptococcus pyogenes cellulitis in an 84-year-old man, presenting a challenging clinical scenario. CASE REPORT An 84-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with 24 h of significant right-arm pain and swelling. Due to the amount of increased swelling and significant pain, compartment pressure was obtained. He underwent emergency fasciotomy of his right forearm, hand, and carpal tunnel release. Both blood and intraoperative wound cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus). The patient suffered a prolonged hospital course requiring multiple subsequent surgeries and eventual skin grafting. Despite his complicated hospital course, he made a remarkable recovery and was discharged home in excellent condition. CONCLUSIONS This report illustrates that compartment syndrome should be considered as a complication of cellulitis in patients with severe pain, even without a history of trauma. Early diagnosis, antibiotic therapy, and emergency fasciotomy are required to preserve the affected limb."

Lower GI tract perforations in the elderly predominate in the West compared to upper GI perforations in the younger population in the tropics. Fungi and viruses have been reported to cause GI perforations in immuno-compromised individuals but it is rare in immuno-competent individuals. We report a very rare case of gastric perforation secondary to fungal gastritis in an immuno-competent 35-year-old female who presented with features of peritonitis. At emergency laparotomy, gastric perforation was found which was repaired by the Cellan-Jones method. Perforation edge biopsy findings were consistent with fungal etiology. She responded well to Antifungal therapy. We conclude that fungal etiology can be considered in patients with gastric perforation without any history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) or use of oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."

The objective of this study is to compare the median plasma values of LRG1 in patients with acute abdomen with and without appendicitis. This case-control study was conducted prospectively at the emergency room (ER) of a tertiary teaching hospital, between March 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2012. Patients with recent abdominal pain, aged 18-70 years who attended at the ER were included in the study. Blood samples were drawn at the first presentation. Those who were submitted to surgery and had a pathology report of AA were considered as cases. Those without a need for surgery and treated for other conditions, e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease, were considered as controls. Follow-up in controls was made up to 30 days. LRG1 plasma median values were measured using an ELISA kit and compared between groups. A total of 28 participants, 14 cases with acute appendicitis and 14 controls, were included. The median (range) values of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein-1 level in the group with appendicitis and control group were 8.8 ng/ml (5.5-31) and 11 (4.6-108) ng/ml, respectively (Mann-Whitney test P = 0.26).

It often indicates a very serious infection which could result in septic shock even death within a very short time, even though the mortality of patients with HPVG went down with the increased use of computed tomography and ultrasound which allows early and highly sensitive detection of such severe illnesses. Here I report a case in which an 84-year-old man was admitted to emergency department for three days of vomiting and two days of abdominal distension after eating an apple who had HPVG associated with intestinal ischemia and acute gastric dilatation and then died of septic shock in a short time. And the pathogenesis of HPVG is not completely clear at present, while three hypotheses may explain the relation between them. Attention must be paid closely to the patient who has HPVG associated with intestinal ischemia, and something must be done because it may indicate a life-threatening acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Arterial aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade (PDA) represent approximately 2% of all aneurysms of visceral arteries. Despite a low incidence, this group of aneurysms is clinically significant due to its high risk of rupture. A 45 years old patient presented with a pancreaticoduodenal arcade aneurysm rupture along with a tight stenosis at the origin of the coeliac trunk. Retrograde blood flow from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) to the hepatic artery (HA) via PDA limited our therapeutic options due to the necessity to maintain liver perfusion. The patient was indicated for an interventional radiology procedure, which consisted of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stent placement at the origin of the coeliac trunk and subsequent transarterial embolisation (TAE) - trapping of the aneurysm using coils. Due to clinical signs of the intra-abdominal compartment syndrome, within 24 hours of the radiological treatment, the patient was indicated for surgical revision (laparotomy). During the surgery, no signs of active bleeding were found; coagula were evacuated from the abdominal cavity (800 ml) and laparostomy was performed with a temporary closure using a grid. Final closure of the abdominal cavity was performed on postoperative day 20 from the initial procedure. Follow-up abdominal CT performed 22 months after TAE showed no recurrence of the aneurysm. Aneurysm rupture represents a serious case of acute abdomen which requires urgent treatment. The preferred method of treatment for ruptured PDA aneurysms is the endovascular intervention using TAE, which is associated with lower morbidity and mortality than the surgical intervention. Concurrent coeliac trunk stenosis requires consideration given the need to maintain sufficient liver perfusion after TAE of the PDA aneurysm, acting up to this point as a collateral circulation of the liver. The choice of the therapeutic approach should be individualised taking into account the above mentioned recommendations."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is a common surgical emergency that classically presents with right lower abdominal pain and tenderness on palpation. The diagnosis is often based on clinical examination in order to avoid the complications of surgery delay, yielding a high rate of negative appendectomies. Ultrasonography is a regularly used modality for establishing the diagnosis, whereas abdominal computed tomography (CT) is often used in sonologically equivocal cases. Other parameters include total leukocyte count, granulocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte elastase activity, D-lactate, phospholipase A2, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). We conducted a prospective study to assess the combined accuracy of total leukocyte count, neutrophil count, and ultrasound as an integrated diagnostic tool. The results of these investigations were tabulated and compared to histopathological evidence of acute appendicitis on biopsy (taken as the gold standard) to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Combined sensitivity and specificity were calculated using cross-tabulation, whereas diagnostic accuracy was estimated from the receiver operating curve (ROC) at the optimal cut-off point. The results showed that the absence of inflammatory findings on ultrasound and normal blood parameters (total leukocyte count and neutrophil count) have a high combined diagnostic accuracy and appendicitis may be ruled out."

Despite being a surgical emergency, this diagnosis is often overlooked before surgery. To raise awareness of this diagnosis among clinicians, we describe here five cases, which occurred at different times in reproductive life. We present five cases of isolated fallopian tube torsion at different ages (13-54 years). It often manifests with sudden onset of acute pelvic pain in four cases and chronic pelvic pain in one case. At admission, patients were suspected of adnexal torsion (3 cases), genital infection (1 case), and renal pain (1 case). CT-scan showed IFTT in only one patient. Laparoscopic surgical management, performed by experienced surgeons, consisted of salpingectomy in 4 cases and conservative treatment in one case. The latter was complicated with hydrosalpinx 6 years later. All patients were followed in outpatient clinic at least one time after surgery and had favorable outcomes. Given the rarity of the pathology and the lack of pathognomonic imaging, IFTT is rarely diagnosed before surgery. Its etiology is still unknown but hydrosalpinx following an infectious process seems to be a major risk factor. Increasing awareness of this rare entity is advocated, especially in woman of reproductive age. Torsion should be evoked in front acute pelvic pain in patients with hydrosalpinx or paratubal cyst. Conservative management must be privileged especially in women of childbearing age and in pediatric population."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is the most common pediatric surgical emergency. Ultrasonography is recommended as first-line imaging for appendicitis in children; however, this is often followed by more advanced imaging. Our goal was to determine if point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) could reduce cost and length-of-stay (LOS) in suspected pediatric appendicitis. We performed a chart review of patients presenting to our pediatric emergency department (ED) from August 1, 2017 to June 30, 2019 who had imaging for appendicitis. We compared cost and LOS for patients who received POCUS to those who had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as first-line imaging, which is standard at our institution. We identified 695 visits of 685 unique patients. Patients who received POCUS (n = 209) had a significantly shorter mean LOS (274 minutes) in the ED compared to patients who did not (317 minutes, P <.001). This was true regardless of the month of their visit. The POCUS group was younger, less likely to have right lower quadrant pain/tenderness, less likely to be admitted, and less likely to have appendicitis than the MRI group. Average appendix imaging cost per patient was lower in the POCUS group at $1308 compared to the MRI group at $1371 (P <.001), although patients who had both POCUS and MRI (n = 102) had the highest average imaging costs ($2010). POCUS can reduce LOS and imaging cost in suspected pediatric appendicitis. Further study is warranted to determine which patients benefit the most from POCUS and whether the results are applicable in other settings."

When the procedure is performed in precarious conditions, by unqualified personnel, it leads to serious consequences, including uterine perforation and its associated lesions. Its management remains a medico-surgical emergency. We present two cases of unsafe abortions performed by cervical dilatation and intrauterine curettage which resulted in uterine perforation and intestinal evisceration through the vagina leading to acute intestinal obstruction. Both patients underwent intensive resuscitation followed by an emergency laparotomy. The first case was a 26-year-old woman living in rural Cameroon. Following a procedure of termination of her pregnancy, the patient noted the presence of bowel at the vaginal introitus associated with signs of intestinal obstruction. She was transferred to a specialized center was after 4 days later of the onset of the evisceration. Considering the gangrened eviscerated terminal ileum, a right hemicolectomy with anastomosis was performed, as well as a suture of the uterine perforation. The second patient was an 18-year-old African living as a refugee in Cameroon. She was referred for abdominal pain in the context of intestinal obstruction with a viable jejunal loop extruding through the vagina. A simple jejunal resection was performed with end-to-end anastomosis and suture of the uterine perforation. In both cases, the postoperative course was uneventful. Uterine perforation is a serious complication of intrauterine gynecological procedures and instrumental abortion in particular. It can lead to evisceration of the intra-abdominal viscera through the uterine perforation. It is therefore a real surgical emergency with multiple and fatal consequences."

CT abdomen revealed thickening of walls of colon and ileum in the right lower quadrant, with signs of small bowel obstruction. Patient underwent emergency laparotomy for the repair of hernia and resection of ischemic bowel, and intraoperatively, was found to have dusky, edematous, thickened, inflamed, and distended distal bowels with adhesions in the right lower quadrant. The pathological examination revealed a thin membrane encasing the ileum, colon and the mesenteric tissue diffusely. Microscopic examination of resected bowel showed marked submucosal edema with myxoid and inflammatory changes. Based on these clinical, radiological and pathological findings, a diagnosis of EPS was established. Her postoperative course was complicated by recurrent intraabdominal bleeding with hemoperitoneum, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiorgan failure, and death, two weeks after the surgery. EPS can present as an acute abdominal catastrophe. Although there are recommendations for ascertainment of EPS diagnosis, there are no clear guidelines for safe and effective surgical strategies and these warrant further research."

We retrospectively studied the proportion of patients referred with suspected cauda equina syndrome who required out of hours transfer for magnetic resonance imaging and decompressive surgery. Retrospective cohort study of patients referred using online referral platforms with suspected acute cauda equina syndrome and transferred out of hours between 6pm to 8am on weekdays and all day on weekends to two of the largest neurosurgical units in the UK in Birmingham and Cambridge. A total of 441 patients were referred across both sites with a suspicion of acute cauda equina syndrome; 339 patients were transferred for diagnostic scans and only 16 of them (4.7%) were positive for cauda equina compression, necessitating prompt decompressive surgery. Of the patients with negative magnetic resonance scans, 50% had their discharge or transfer back to referring hospitals delayed by more than 24 hours. Over 95% of patients who were transferred for imaging did not undergo emergency decompression. The authors propose a greater role for the provision of out of hours magnetic resonance imaging in all hospitals admitting emergency patients to streamline management."

On laparotomy, there was a dilated gut with long appendix having inflamed tip buried into adjoining mesentery and then appendectomy was done and obstruction was relieved. Also, bowel was found to be viable hence simple appendectomy was found to be sufficient treatment. Histopathological findings was suggestive of chronic fibrosing appendicitis. Hence, in cases of bowel obstruction in an elderly patients with clinical examination which was not typical for appendicitis can be managed with laparotomy and simple appendectomy when early intervention is made to avoid the risk of ischemia and gangrenous changes in intestinal mesentery which may require resection in later stages."

Here, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of emergency cPD for patients with advanced colon carcinoma manifesting as acute abdomen. We retrospectively reviewed 4898 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent curative colectomy during the period from 1994 to 2018. Among them, 30 had locally advanced right colon cancer and had received cPD. Among them, surgery was performed in 11 patients in emergency conditions (bowel obstruction: 6, perforation: 3, tumor bleeding: 2). Selection criteria for emergency cPD were the following: (1) age ≤ 60 years, (2) body mass index < 35 kg/m2, (3) no poorly controlled comorbidities, and (4) perforation time ≤ 6 h. Three patients did not meet the above criteria and received non-emergency cPD after a life-saving diverting ileostomy, followed by cPD performed 3 months later. We analyzed these patients in terms of their clinicopathological characteristics, the early and long-term postoperative outcomes, and compared findings between emergency cPD group (e-group, n = 11) and non-emergency cPD group (non-e-group, n = 19). After cPD, staged pancreaticojejunostomy was performed in all e-group patients, and on 15 of 19 patients in the non-e-group. The non-e-group was older and had a higher incidence of associated comorbidities, while other clinicopathological characteristics were similar between the two groups. None of the patients in the two groups succumbed from cPD. The postoperative complication rate was 63.6% in the e-group and 42.1% in the non-e-group (p = 0.449). The 5-year overall survival rate were 15.9% in the e-group and 52.6% in the non-e-group (p = 0.192). Emergency cPD is feasible in highly selected patients if performed by experienced surgeons. The early and long-term positive outcomes of emergency cPD are similar to those after non-emergency cPD in patients with acute abdominal conditions."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery. Contrary to elective procedures, emergency operations should not be postponed. We aim to evaluate the profile and outcomes of COVID-19 patients who underwent emergency abdominal surgery. We performed a retrospective analysis of perioperative data of COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgery from April 2020 to August 2020. Eighty-two patients were evaluated due to abdominal complaints, yielding 22 emergency surgeries. The mean APACHE II and SAPS were 18.7 and 68, respectively. Six patients had a PaO2/FiO2 lower than 200 and more than 50% of parenchymal compromise on chest tomography. The most common indications for emergency surgery were hernias (6; 27.2%). The median length of stay was 30 days, and only two patients required reoperation. Postoperatively, 10 (43.3%) patients needed mechanical ventilation for a mean of 6 days. The overall mortality rate was 31.8%. Both postoperative morbidity and mortality are high in COVID-19 patients with respiratory compromise and abdominal emergencies."

    "abstract": "Visceral artery aneurysms are rare, but they may cause heavy bleeding and high mortality. In addition, aneurysms originating from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) account for only 1% of visceral artery aneurysms. We report the rare case of a ruptured transverse pancreatic artery aneurysm originating from the SMA that required urgent surgical treatment. A 66-year-old woman presented with acute back pain after lunch, and she was transported by ambulance. She had upper quadrant spontaneous pain and moderate tenderness, but no guarding or rebound pain. She had rheumatoid arthritis, and was taking 10 mg of steroids per day. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a retroperitoneal hematoma spreading to the ventral side of the left kidney and extravasation of contrast agent from a branch of the SMA. We diagnosed rupture of aneurysm. We conferred with our IVR team on treatment strategy for the ruptured aneurysm. In addition, we finally selected operation, since the branch of the SMA to the aneurysm was too thin and complex to conduct IVR. For this reason, we performed emergency simple aneurysmectomy of the transverse pancreatic artery. The postoperative course was relatively smooth. Rupture of a transverse pancreatic artery aneurysm originating from the SMA is rare. However, when diagnosing patients with acute abdomen or back pain, we should consider rupture of a visceral artery aneurysm. Endovascular treatment may currently be common for ruptured visceral artery aneurysms, but we should flexibly treat them according to the patient's condition and facility considerations."

    "abstract": "In recent times, there has been an increasing burden in traumatic, medical, and surgical emergency conditions, placing more emphasis on the need for quality emergency care. This study aimed to explore the challenges experienced by nurses working in the emergency unit of a secondary referral hospital. The study used an exploratory qualitative research design with a constructivist approach and a grounded theory method. Data were collected through in-depth interviews lasting between 30 to 45 minutes using a semi-structured interview guide. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse data. Eleven (11) participants were interviewed. The majority were female (9), aged between 31-40 years. From the inductive content analysis, four themes emerged. These were; 1) overcrowding in the emergency unit, 2) understaffing at the emergency unit, 3) lack of emergency equipment, 4) inadequate managerial support. The study identified several major challenges confronting nurses working in the emergency unit which are linked with managerial processes and inadequate managerial support. These challenges need to be addressed to promote quality emergency nursing care. To foster a positive working environment, hospital management should validate and address the aforementioned concerns of the Emergency Department nurses."

    "abstract": "The term Gossypiboma is used to describe a retained surgical sponge in body after surgical procedure. It is an infrequent but serious surgical complication which is seldom reported because of the medicolegal implications. It can present within days as a surgical emergency or years after the operation. We report a case of 30-year-old female who presented in emergency with acute pain abdomen and severe distention of abdomen. She had history of caesarean section 15 days ago at another hospital. On clinical examination and investigation, it appeared like a surgical abdomen. Contrast enhanced computed tomography suspected an intrabdominal Gossypiboma. On exploratory laparotomy there was a lump in left side of abdominal cavity. Retained surgical sponge was removed that confirmed the diagnosis of Gossypiboma. Gossypiboma is a real, serious but preventable surgical complication. It affects the patient safety, cost of treatment and may cause mortality if there is delay in diagnosis and treatment. It is commonly seen in emergency and difficult surgeries. Its clinical presentation is extremely variable. It can cause acute surgical abdomen, that needs urgent surgical intervention. Meticulous counts of surgical items with careful inspection of surgical site can lessen these complications.

If severe, an urgent surgical intervention may be life saving. Our aim is to alert paediatric surgeons to this rare condition. Early detection and early treatment with a minimally invasive surgical procedure may be life saving and prevent severe sequelae due to respiratory distress. We present a healthy newborn girl who was admitted to neonatal intensive care with progressive respiratory distress. After a full work-up, she was diagnosed with bilateral dacryocystocoele with intranasal extension and complete obstruction of the anterior nasal cavity. Emergency bilateral endoscopic marsupialization of the cysts with probing of the nasolacrimal duct was performed. The girl recovered without sequelae. In congenital dacryocystocoele, coexistent obstruction of the valve of Rosenmüller and the valve of Hasner is observed. Subsequent intranasal protrusion with obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity may occur. The incidence is unknown, but if bilateral, it is very rare. In most cases, a dacryocystocoele is uncomplicated and may be treated conservatively. However, if intranasal protrusion occurs, and especially if the involvement is bilateral, it is a surgical emergency. Early diagnosis with subsequent minimally invasive surgical treatment of bilateral congenital dacryocystocoele with intranasal protrusion may prevent serious complications due to respiratory distress."

Though isolated mesenteric arterial occlusion associated with COVID-19 has been reported in literature, combined superior mesenteric arterial and venous thrombosis is rare. We report a case of combined superior mesenteric arterial and venous occlusion associated with COVID-19 infection. We report a case of a 45-year-old man who was a health care worker who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. The clinical examination was unremarkable, but imaging revealed acute mesenteric ischemia caused by superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein occlusion. Imaging of the chest was suggestive of COVID-19 infection, which was later confirmed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of his nasopharyngeal swab. To date, only 1 case of combined superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis caused by COVID-19 has been reported. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: During the COVID-19 pandemic it is important to keep mesenteric ischemia in the differential diagnosis of unexplained abdominal pain. Routinely adding high-resolution computed tomography of the chest to abdominal imaging should be considered in patients with acute abdomen because it can help to identify COVID-19 immediately. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

Efforts to improve efficiency and quality of care have increased reliance on computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US) in children with suspected appendicitis. To evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic health record-linked clinical decision support intervention, AppyCDS, on diagnostic imaging, health care costs, and safety outcomes for patients with suspected appendicitis. In this parallel, cluster randomized trial, 17 community-based general emergency departments (EDs) in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin were randomized to the AppyCDS intervention group or usual care (UC) group. Patients were aged 5 to 20 years, presenting for an ED visit with right-sided or diffuse abdominal pain lasting 5 days or less. We excluded pregnant patients, those with a prior appendectomy, those with selected comorbidities, and those with traumatic injuries. The trial was conducted from October 2016 to July 2019. AppyCDS prompted data entry at the point of care to estimate appendicitis risk using the pediatric appendicitis risk calculator (pARC). Based on pARC estimates, AppyCDS recommended next steps in care. Primary outcomes were CT, US, or any imaging (CT or US) during the index ED visit. Safety outcomes were perforations, negative appendectomies, and missed appendicitis. Costs were a secondary outcome. Ratio of ratios (RORs) for primary and safety outcomes and differences by group in cost were used to evaluate effectiveness of the clinical decision support tool. We enrolled 3161 patients at intervention EDs and 2779 patients at UC EDs. The mean age of patients was 11.9 (4.6) years and 2614 (44.0%) were boys or young men. RORs for CT (0.94; 95% CI, 0.75-1.19), US (0.98; 95% CI, 0.84-1.14), and any imaging (0.96; 95% CI, 0.86-1.07) did not differ by study group. In an exploratory analysis conducted in 1 health system, AppyCDS was associated with a reduction in any imaging (ROR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73- 0.93) for patients with pARC score of 15% or less and a reduction in CT (ROR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.45-0.74) for patients with a pARC score of 16% to 50%. Perforations, negative appendectomies, and cases of missed appendicitis by study phase did not differ significantly by study group. Costs did not differ overall by study group. In this study, AppyCDS was not associated with overall reductions in diagnostic imaging; exploratory analysis revealed more appropriate use of imaging in patients with a low pARC score.

    "abstract": "Recent consensus guidelines suggest that the laparoscopic approach may be a useful, safe and feasible approach in emergency general surgery. Despite this, the UK National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) suggests the rate of laparoscopy is low (9% fully laparoscopic) and slow to increase over time. A European survey found uptake to be variable. This UK survey was therefore undertaken to establish current UK practice and to determine factors affecting implementation. A questionnaire survey of currently practising UK consultant general surgeons was carried out by the North West Surgical Research Collaborative, using a secure web-based database maintained by the North West Surgical Trials Centre. A total of 151 completed questionnaires were returned from 22 UK centres; 18% of respondents were unaware that laparoscopic cases should be reported to NELA. Appendicectomy (97%) and cholecystectomy (87%) were routinely performed laparoscopically. Laparoscopy was infrequently used in perforation, ischaemia or obstructed hernias. There appears to be equipoise regarding laparoscopic compared with open surgery in small-bowel obstruction among all subspecialty emergency general surgeons, in perforated peptic ulcer among upper gastrointestinal surgeons and in Hinchey III diverticulitis among colorectal surgeons. Uptake of laparoscopy in UK emergency general surgery is influenced by surgeon preference, subspecialty, patient and operative factors. Further research into outcomes may help to identify areas of greatest potential benefit. The rate of laparoscopy reported by NELA may be an underestimate due to the 18% of surgeons unaware that laparoscopic cases should be reported, which may affect the validity of analyses performed from this dataset."

This article describes the ultrasound features of diverse bowel diseases that can cause acute abdomen, such as acute diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, bowel ischemia, intraabdominal fat necrosis, and miscellaneous processes such as endometriosis, foreign bodies, or vasculitis. Radiologists must be familiar with the different features of abnormal bowel that can be detected incidentally in patients without clinical suspicion of bowel disease.

Fecal impaction is generally preventable, and early recognition of the typical radiological findings is important for making an early diagnosis. The factors that lead to fecal impaction are usually similar to those causing constipation. Few cases with fecal impaction associated with a diverticulum have been reported. We present the case of a 62-year-old woman who suffered from abdominal pain and vomiting, had a medical history of repeated acute abdomen and was diagnosed with fecal impaction in the descending colon based on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging. After examination by gastrografin-enhanced colonography following colonoscopy and CT colonography, the fecalith was suspected to have been produced at the site of a large diverticulum in the transverse colon. The fecalith was surgically resected, and a histological diagnosis of pseudodiverticulum was made. There was no recurrence during 33 mo of follow-up. This case highlights the importance of accurate identification and treatment of a fecal impaction. This case indicated that the endoscopic evacuation and subsequent colonography were effective for identifying a diverticulum that might have caused fecal impaction. A fecal impaction was associated with the diverticulum. Consequently, the planned diverticulectomy was performed. Appropriate emergency medical treatment and maintenance treatments should be selected in such cases to prevent recurrence."

To compare the 30-d mortality rate and complications of hip fracture patients treated during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times. The search of electronic databases on 1st August 2020 revealed 45 studies related to mortality of hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and pre-pandemic times.

We report the case of a 71-year-old immunocompetent man who was admitted to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and features of perforation peritonitis. A sigmoid perforation on cancer was suspected on computed tomography (CT) scan and surgical exploration. A standard sigmoidectomy with end colostomy (Hartmann's procedure) and peritoneal toileting was done. The pathological assessment of the surgical specimen revealed the sigmoid colon tuberculosis, complicated by perforation and peritonitis. Thus, the unexpected diagnosis of sigmoid colon tuberculosis was only made after the histopathological examination. Then, he received anti-tuberculosis treatment for six months. Therefore, a complete colonoscopy was performed at the end of the treatment, which returned to be normal. Thereafter, the restoration of intestinal continuity was performed. Colon tuberculosis is a rare disease and even rarer in people without immunodeficiency or on immunosuppressive therapy. If diverticulitis is the most common cause of sigmoid perforation, sigmoid perforation because of tuberculosis is extremely rare. However, an isolated primary sigmoid perforation of tubercular origin is not reported. We report this exceptional case of sigmoid colon tuberculosis complicated by perforation and generalized peritonitis to sensitize the medical team to its rare occurrence, which will be of paramount importance due to the increasing incidence of tuberculosis worldwide."

Here, we report a pediatric surgery case with incarcerated inguinal hernia and suspected COVID-19. A 11-month-old male was brought to our emergency department with the main complaint of recurrent yellowish-green vomiting that was experienced from one day before admission. High fever and shortness of breath were also reported. This patient was also suffering from moderate dehydration. Neither history of contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 nor traveling from any local transmission area were found. However, a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody test revealed a positive result. A lump in the left scrotum that persisted during admission was found. Fluid resuscitation and nasogastric tube placement for decompression was performed. Manual reduction was attempted but failed to reduce the lump. Accordingly, we decided to perform an emergency high ligation using tertiary protection regulations, i.e., full personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19. Intraoperatively, we found a small intestine loop trapped in the scrotum and stuck in the inguinal canal. Postoperatively, the baby was continued to be managed as a patient with COVID-19 while waiting for the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results. Manual reduction is standard treatment for incarcerated inguinal hernia in children. The successful rate of manual reduction is about 70%, therefore, if the manual reduction fails, an emergency surgery is mandatory.During the COVID-19 pandemic, all medical procedures require clarity of the patient's status including whether infected with COVID-19. Along with proper precautions, great care must be taken during surgery to minimize the risk of cross infection to health workers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons should always be aware of the possibility of cross-transmission from the patient, since children are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. When and wherever possible, surgeons should perform the procedure in the quickest and most effective manner to shorten exposure time with patient and anesthetic aerosols as well as using appropriate PPE."

We report the case of a 34-year-old woman in the first trimester of pregnancy who had a missed diagnosis of acute appendicitis after she had complained of vague abdominal symptoms for three weeks. She presented to a gynaecologist with vaginal bleeding for three days and was noted to have a heterotopic pregnancy on ultrasound scan. At laparotomy, she was noted to have a gangrenous appendicitis with pyoperitoneum concurrent with a ruptured left fimbrial ectopic pregnancy. Left salpingectomy and saline lavage were done and she had uneventful post-operative recovery. Unsuspecting clinicians, in patients without risk factors, can miss both heterotopic pregnancy and acute appendicitis. As assisted reproductive techniques become widespread, the possibility of heterotopic pregnancies must always be considered and any patient who presents with vague abdominal symptoms must be suspected to have the possibility of acute appendicitis. Because of the unreliability of laboratory investigations and clinical predictive scores in pregnancy, sonographers must be specifically asked to scan for heterotopic pregnancy and appendicitis in suspected cases."

    "abstract": "To determine if boys with acute testicular torsion, a surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment to optimize salvage of the testicle, delayed presentation to a medical facility and experienced an extended duration of symptoms (DoS), and secondarily, a higher rate of orchiectomy, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Single-center, descriptive retrospective chart review of boys presenting with acute testicular torsion from March 15, to May 4, 2020 (\"during COVID-19\" or group 2), as well as for the same time window in the 5-year period from 2015 to 2019 (\"pre-COVID-19\" or group 1). A total of 78 boys met inclusion criteria, group 1 (n = 57) and group 2 (n = 21). The mean age was 12.86 ± 2.63 (group 1) and 12.86 ± 2.13 (group 2). Mean DoS before presentation at a medical facility was 23.2 ± 35.0 hours in group 1 compared with 21.3 ± 29.7 hours in group 2 (P < 0.37). When DoS was broken down into acute (<24 hours) versus delayed (≥24 hours), 41 (71.9%) of 57 boys in group 1 and 16 (76.2%) of 21 boys in group 2 presented within less than 24 hours of symptom onset (P < 0.78). There was no difference in rate of orchiectomy between group 1 and group 2 (44.7% vs 25%, P < 0.17), respectively. Boys with acute testicular torsion in our catchment area did not delay presentation to a medical facility from March 15, to May 4, 2020, and did not subsequently undergo a higher rate of orchiectomy."

    "title": "Teaching the Evaluation of Female Pelvic Pain: A Hands-On Simulation to Reinforce Exam Skills and Introduce Transvaginal Ultrasound.",
    "abstract": "Reproductive-age female patients commonly seek evaluation for pelvic pain in a variety of health care settings. Thus, teaching medical students how to effectively evaluate female pelvic pain is a necessary part of medical education. There are limited opportunities, however, to reinforce the needed skills for this common but sensitive presentation that can be anxiety-producing for preclinical students. The case involved a 23-year-old female presenting with lower abdominal/pelvic pain. Students performed the necessary history, physical examination, cervical sampling, and transvaginal ultrasound evaluation to make the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) complicated by a tubo-ovarian abscess. The 30-minute simulated patient encounter was followed by a 30-40 minute faculty-led debrief. This simulation case has been sustained in the curriculum since 2011 for 65 students per year. Through use of a faculty critical action checklist, debrief discussion, examination performance, and student evaluation feedback, this simulation has demonstrated effectiveness. Of students, 93 of 193 students (48%) who participated in the simulation case from 2018-2020 completed a survey in which they rated the degree of agreement with statements about the simulation based on a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). All questions had a mean response of 4.5-4.8 in 2018-2020, demonstrating the consistent agreement by students of the clarity, fidelity, and knowledge-enhancing value of the simulation. This simulation provided a useful opportunity and a safe environment for preclinical medical students to acquire knowledge and skills necessary to evaluate a female patient with pelvic pain and PID."

    "abstract": "Acute upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding is one of the most frequent presentations to a surgical emergency. Most of them respond to initial resuscitation, and a definite diagnosis is established as soon as possible, thereby helping the clinician in management. We present the diagnostic challenges that we faced with a 70-year-old man who presented with UGI bleed. He initially responded to resuscitation, but later deteriorated and became haemodynamically unstable. The source of the UGI bleed on evaluation was found to be pseudoaneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery (PsGDA) and treated successfully by coil embolisation. The cause of the PsGDA was diverticulum arising from the first part of duodenum with changes of diverticulitis. Diverticulum originating from the first part of the duodenum is seldom reported. Moreover, diverticulitis involving this part and causing PsGDA has not been reported so far."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency in children. However, it is challenging to seek appropriate treatment for childhood ileus since many diagnostic measures suitable for adults are not applicable to children. The rapid development of machine learning has spurred much interest in its application to medical imaging problems but little in medical text mining. In this paper, a two-layer model based on text data such as routine blood count and urine tests is proposed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and assist in clinical decision-making. The samples of this study were 526 children with intestinal obstruction. Firstly, the samples were divided into two groups according to whether they had intestinal obstruction surgery, and then, the surgery group was divided into two groups according to whether the intestinal tube was necrotic. Specifically, we combined 63 physiological indexes of each child with their corresponding label and fed them into a deep learning neural network which contains multiple fully connected layers. Subsequently, the corresponding value was obtained by activation function. The 5-fold cross-validation was performed in the first layer and demonstrated a mean accuracy (Acc) of 80.04%, and the corresponding sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and MCC were 67.48%, 87.46%, and 0.57, respectively. Additionally, the second layer can also reach an accuracy of 70.4%. This study shows that the proposed algorithm has direct meaning to processing of clinical text data of childhood ileus."

Since the established parameters have low sensitivity and specificity, the aim of this study is to analyze the diagnostic quality of the established parameters of AMI. All patients that underwent emergency surgery due to suspected diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf between 2008 and 2014 were evaluated. Overall, 275 patients were enrolled and pre-, intra- and postoperative data were evaluated. In 200 patients, a mesenteric ischemia was confirmed intraoperatively, and 75 patients had no ischemia. Comparing these groups, the rate of patients with pH < 7.2 (25 vs. 12%; p = 0.021) and elevated mean CRP level (175 ± 117 mg/L vs. 139 ± 104 mg/L; p = 0.019) was significantly higher in ischemic patients. There was no significant difference in the level of preoperative lactate. Concerning abdominal CT scan, a sensitivity and specificity of 61 and 68%, respectively, was found. New diagnostic parameters are needed. So far, explorative laparotomy is the only reliable diagnostic method to detect mesenteric infarction."

    "abstract": "Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain often undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan as part of their diagnostic workup. We investigated the relationship between availability, timeliness, and interpretation of CT imaging and outcomes for life-threatening intra-abdominal diseases or \"acute abdomen,\" in older Americans. Data from a 2015 national survey of 2811 hospitals regarding emergency general surgery structures and processes (60.1% overall response, n = 1690) were linked to 2015 Medicare inpatient claims data. We identified beneficiaries aged ≥65 admitted emergently with a confirmatory acute abdomen diagnosis code and operative intervention on the same calendar date. Multivariable regression models adjusted for significant covariates determined odds of complications and mortality based on CT resources. We identified 9125 patients with acute abdomen treated at 1253 hospitals, of which 78% had ≥64-slice CT scanners and 85% had 24/7 CT technicians. Overnight CT reads were provided by in-house radiologists at 14% of hospitals and by teleradiologists at 66%. Patients were predominantly 65-74 y old (43%), white (88%), females (60%), and with ≥3 comorbidities (67%) and 8.6% died. STAT radiology reads by a board-certified radiologist rarely/never available in 2 h was associated with increased odds of systemic complication and mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.6 [1.3-5.4] and 2.3 [1.1-4.8], respectively). Delays obtaining results are associated with adverse outcomes in older patients with acute abdomen. This may be due to delays in surgical consultation and time to source control while waiting for imaging results. Processes to ensure timely interpretation of CT scans in patients with abdominal pain may improve outcomes in high-risk patients."

    "title": "Rectus Sheath Hematoma: A Rare Surgical Emergency.",
    "abstract": "A rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is a rare medical condition that consists of blood accumulating in the rectus abdominis muscle sheath. RSH is most frequently due to a hemorrhage from the superior or inferior epigastric artery. RSH has many specific risk factors, such as anticoagulant use. As the use of anticoagulants increases, the incidence of RSH has also increased. This condition can present with the infrequent complication of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), which can require surgical decompression of the abdomen to avoid high morbidity and mortality. We present the case of a 79-year-old male who, after receiving anticoagulants, developed a right-sided RSH which progressed to ACS. The patient was transferred to our care for community-acquired pneumonia, pneumothorax, and increasing respiratory support. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU), was placed on a nasal cannula, and given vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia. After two days, the patient was switched to enoxaparin for anticoagulation. After three days, the patient's pneumothorax had resolved. At this time, the patient reported swelling in his right lower quadrant (RLQ) with mild pain, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty voiding completely. The physical examination confirmed RLQ swelling, and a kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) x-ray and ultrasound were ordered. A CT with and without contrast was also obtained which showed a large right rectus sheath hematoma extension into preperitoneal space and a small amount of intraperitoneal fluid along the right paracolic gutter. Soon after, the patient became lightheaded and fell after using the restroom. Vitals at the time were a blood pressure of 79/56, heart rate (HR) of 127, and oxygen saturation of 88% with his hemoglobin dropping from 11.4 g/dL earlier that morning to 8.4 g/dL. The patient's care was transferred to our surgical team in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU). He received an arterial line, two doses of protamine, 1-liter of crystalloids, and two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's vitals normalized. Interventional radiology (IR) was consulted but they requested the coagulopathy be corrected before any intervention. Reversal of his Lovenox® was thromboelastographic (TEG)-guided and included platelets, cryoprecipitate, and prothrombin complex concentrate/fresh frozen plasma (PCC/FFP), in addition to more PRBCs. During these interventions, the patient acutely decompensated with hypotension, difficulty breathing, and expansion of his hematoma. A bladder pressure in the 30s was obtained, causing him to be sent to the operating room (OR) for decompression, extraperitoneal packing, and the wound was temporarily closed. The patient returned and IR was able to embolize the right inferior epigastric artery. The patient was taken to the OR again for exploration, removal of packing, and closure. RSH is a rare complication that can occur due to trauma, coagulopathy, obesity, and muscle strains during a pregnancy. Larger hematomas tend to occur below the arcuate line because there is an absence of the posterior rectus sheath which enables the hematomas to spread. An RSH can be treated with conservative measures, but for patients who continue to bleed, more aggressive measures should be taken to avoid life-threatening complications, such as ACS."

    "abstract": "Spermatic cord torsion (SCT) is a surgical emergency. Any delay in diagnosis or treatment may compromise the vital and functional prognosis of the testicle. The orchiectomy rate remains very high in the literature; it can even reach 50 % in certain series. Several factors have been reported in the literature as being significantly correlated with the risk of orchiectomy: duration of symptoms, the number of turns, the younger ages, etc. The objective of this study has been to analyse the predictive factors of orchiectomy in adult SCT in our context. During the study period, 74 cases of SCT were included. Orchidopexy was performed in 43.2 % (32/74) versus orchiectomy in 56.8 % (42/74) of cases. The patients' median age was 22 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 18-26.75 years). The duration of symptoms (p = 0.009), the previous medical management (p < 0.001), performing a scrotal ultrasonography (p = 0.004) were statistically significant at univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis only the previous medical management was statistically significant (p = 0.017). The orchiectomy rate was very high in our cohort. The previous medical management was the only significant predictive factor of orchiectomy on multivariate analysis. Our findings demonstrated that the delay in diagnosis is the determining factor in testicular loss in our context. RéSUMé: CONTEXTE: La torsion du cordon spermatique est une urgence chirurgicale. Tout retard dans le diagnostic ou le traitement peut compromettre le pronostic vital et fonctionnel du testicule. Le taux d'orchidectomie reste très élevé dans la littérature;il peut même atteindre 50 % dans certaines séries. Plusieurs facteurs ont été rapportés dans la littérature comme étant significativement corrélés au risque d'orchidectomie. L'objectif de cette étude était d'analyser les facteurs prédictifs d'orchidectomie dans la torsion du cordon spermatique de l'adulte dans notre contexte. RéSULTATS: Durant la période d’étude 74 patients ont été inclus. Une orchidopexie a été réalisée dans 43,2 % (32/74) des cas et une orchidectomie dans 56,8 %(42/74) des cas. L'âge médian des patients était de 22 ans (écart interquartile=18-26,75 ans). La durée des symptômes (p = 0,009), la prise en charge médicale antérieure(p<0,001), la réalisation d'une échographie des bourses (p = 0,004) étaient significativement corrélées au risque d’orchidectomie à l’analyse univariée. A l'analyse multivariée, seule la prise en charge médicale antérieure était significativement corrélée au risque d’orchidectomie (p=0.017). CONCLUSION: Le taux d'orchidectomie était très élevé dans notre cohorte. La prise en charge médicale antérieure était le seul facteur prédictif significatif de l'orchidectomie à l'analyse multivariée. Nos résultats ont montré que le retard diagnostic est le facteur déterminant de la perte testiculaire dans notre contexte.

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is a rare condition when at least two pregnancies are present simultaneously at different implantation sites and only one located in the uterine cavity. The majority of cases are diagnosed in the first trimester. We present a unique case of HP diagnosed at 26 weeks of spontaneous pregnancy in a patient without any relevant risk factors. We performed an extensive review of HP cases from MEDLINE (PUBMED) published in English between 2005-2019 to prove this case's uniqueness. A 24-year-old woman presented because of threatened preterm birth. Despite treatment, pain aggravated, without progression of labor. An emergency ultrasound exam revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity. Suspicion of active bleeding prompted the medical team to perform an exploratory laparotomy. The surgery team found a ruptured heterotopic pregnancy. This was an unexpected cause of nontraumatic hemoperitoneum at such advanced gestational age. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the intrauterine pregnancy continued to term. The final review included 86 out of 124 records. A total number of 509 cases were identified, but not all of them had complete data. The maximum reported gestational age at the time of diagnosis was 16 weeks of pregnancy, while our case became symptomatic and was diagnosed at 26 weeks of pregnancy. Regardless of pregnancy age, HP can be a cause of hemoperitoneum, and it should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in the second trimester."

    "abstract": "Peritonitis attacks of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) usually requires emergency medical admissions and it’s hard to distinguish a typical abdominal attack from surgical causes of acute abdomen. Therefore, history of abdominal surgery, particularly appendectomy, is very common in patients with FMF. However, history of appendectomy might also give some clues about the course of FMF in the adulthood. This study was to determine whether the history of appendectomy help to anticipate disease course of FMF in the adulthood. All patients recruited from FMF in Central Anatolia (FiCA) cohort, comprising 971 adult subjects. All patients fulfilled the Tel Hashomer criteria. Demographic data, FMF disease characteristics, co-morbid conditions, past medical history, surgical history and disease complications were meticulously questioned and laboratory features and genotype data (if available) were recruited from patient files. Appendectomy history was evident in 240 (24.7%) subjects. Disease onset was earlier and peritonitis is strikingly more prevalent (97.1% vs. 89.6%, p < 0.001) in appendectomized patients. These patients had reported almost two fold more frequent attacks in the last year compared to appendix intact patients (median 3.5 vs. 2 attacks, p = 0.001) without a difference in frequency of musculoskeletal and skin attacks. Severe disease was more common (10% vs. 5.9%, p = 0.038) due to involvement of more attack sites throughout the life and more frequent attacks. Appendectomy patients had used higher daily doses of colchicine to control disease (1.43 ± 0.6 mg vs. 1.27 ± 0.52 mg, p = 0.002) but colchicine resistance was also more common in these patients, 15% vs. 6.7% respectively, p < 0.001. Appendectomy history is common in FMF patients and associated with frequent serositis attacks in adulthood. These patients require higher colchicine doses with a lower rate of response and more need for Interleukin-1 antagonist therapies."

    "abstract": "An infectious disease named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19) currently has brought a threat to global health security and trends to be more and more severe in many countries. It also has introduced great challenges to the diagnosis and management of children with hepatoblastoma (HB). During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric surgeons should not only develop personalized treatment plans for HB therapy, but also emphasize the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of this virus. Children with both HB and COVID-19 are recommended to undertake multidisciplinary assessment. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy may be a preferred treatment for the infected without presenting a surgical emergency. However, emergent operation may be necessary for HB children with concurrent COVID-19 who developed a life-threatening surgical emergency condition. Otherwise, for children with negative virus examination results, treatment advice should be based on the impact of the epidemic and regional economic considerations. A \"wait and see\" strategy is recommended for children with resectable tumors after new adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (NACT). Assessment of liver transplantation is recommended for children with HB whose tumors cannot be resected after NACT. Children with HB with pulmonary metastasis may have abnormal findings on chest imaging due to COVID-19. Besides, the detailed therapeutic regimens may vary for children with HB with or without an emergency presentation. Based on previous consensus, current research, and the experiences of our hospital, we aim to offer available management plans for the above-mentioned concerns."

    "abstract": "Orbital floor fractures occur commonly as a result of blunt trauma to the face and periorbital region. Orbital floor fractures with a \"trapdoor\" component allow both herniation and incarceration of contents through a bone defect into the maxillary sinus as the bone rebounds faster than the soft tissue, trapping muscle, fat, and fascia in the fracture site. In children, the fractured floor, which is often hinged on one side, tends to return toward its original anatomical position due to the incomplete nature of the fracture and elasticity of the bone. The entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle itself is considered a true surgical emergency-prolonged entrapment frequently leads to muscle ischemia and necrosis leading to permanent limitation of extraocular motility and difficult to correct diplopia. For this reason, prompt surgical intervention is recommended by most surgeons. In adults, true entrapment of the muscle itself is not as common because the orbital floor is not as elastic and fractures are more complete. We present an adult patient with an isolated orbital floor fracture with clinical and radiologic evidence of true entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle itself. Despite the delayed surgical repair (4 days after the injury), the patient's inferior rectus muscle function returned to near normal with mild upward gaze diplopia. Inferior rectus entrapment in adults may more likely be associated with immobilization of the muscle without total vascular compression/incarceration significant enough to lead to complete ischemic necrosis."

The patient was treated with decompressive laminectomy and discectomy that resulted in significant neurological improvement. Etiologic factors of CES in the pediatric population include tumors, trauma, iatrogenic injuries, spinal dysraphism, constipation and inferior vena cava syndrome. This case is being reported for the rarity of this syndrome in pediatric population especially when the etiological factor is acute disc herniation, which is also rare in this particular population.

Although the condition is relatively rare, the associated morbidity can be devastating to patients. While substantial research has been conducted on the timing of treatment, the literature regarding long-term rates of bladder dysfunction in CES patients is scarce. The aim of this study was to identify long-term rates of bladder dysfunction in CES patients and to compare those rates to non-CES patients who underwent similar spinal decompression. Retrospective database study. The CES cohort was comprised of 2,362 patients who underwent decompression surgery following CES diagnosis with a 5-year follow-up. These patients were matched to 9,448 non-CES control patients who underwent spinal decompression without a diagnosis of CES. Diagnosis of bladder dysfunction, surgical procedure to address bladder dysfunction METHODS: Using the national insurance claims database, PearlDiver, CES patients who underwent decompression surgery were identified and 1:4 matched to non-CES patients who underwent similar spinal decompression surgery. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year rates of progression to a bladder dysfunction diagnosis and surgical intervention to manage bladder dysfunction were recorded. The CES and non-CES groups were compared with univariate testing, and an analysis of risk factors for bladder dysfunction was performed with multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 2,362 CES patients who underwent decompression surgery were identified and matched to 9,448 non-CES control patients. After 5 years, CES patients had a 10%-12% increased absolute risk of continued bladder dysfunction and a 0.7%-0.9% increased absolute risk of undergoing a surgical procedure for bladder dysfunction, as compared to matched non-CES patients. Multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, obesity, tobacco use, and diabetes, identified CES as independently associated with increased 5-year risk for bladder dysfunction diagnosis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.72; 95% confidence interaval [CI] 1.56-1.89; p<.001) and procedure (OR: 1.40; 95% CI 1.07-1.81; p=.012). Understanding the long-term risk for bladder dysfunction in CES patients is important for the future care and counseling of patients. Compared to non-CES patients who underwent similar spinal decompression, CES patients were observed to have a significantly higher long-term likelihood for both bladder dysfunction diagnosis and urologic surgical procedure."

    "abstract": "Health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced to adhere to current COVID-19 prevention recommendations. Recommendations for surgical emergency trauma care measures need to be adequately informed by available evidence and adapt to particular settings. To inform future recommendations, we set to summarize the effects of different personal protective equipment (PPE) on the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for trauma surgery patients. We conducted an umbrella review using Living Overview of Evidence platform for COVID-19, which performs regular automated searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and more than 30 other sources. Systematic reviews of experimental and observational studies assessing the efficacy of PPE were included. Indirect evidence from other health care settings was also considered. Risk of bias was assessed with the AMSTAR II tool (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews, Ottawa, ON, Canada), and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for grading the certainty of the evidence is reported (registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42020198267). Eighteen studies that fulfilled the selection criteria were included. There is high certainty that the use of N95 respirators and surgical masks is associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 when compared with no mask use. In moderate- to high-risk environments, N95 respirators are associated with a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 infection compared with surgical masks. Eye protection also reduces the risk of contagion in this setting. Decontamination of masks and respirators with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, or dry heat is effective and does not affect PPE performance or fit. The use of PPE drastically reduces the risk of COVID-19 compared with no mask use in health care workers. N95 and equivalent respirators provide more protection than surgical masks. Decontamination and reuse appear feasible to overcome PPE shortages and enhance the allocation of limited resources. These effects are applicable to emergency trauma care and should inform future recommendations. Review, level II."

It is a surgical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to explore the temporal and seasonal trends in NF infection in Qatar. Methods: A total of 327 patients diagnosed with NF, aged ≥ 18 years, and admitted to the Hamad General Hospital, Qatar, in 2002-2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The hospitalization and mortality rates in the general population in Qatar and the case fatality rate (CFR) were calculated for each year. The patients were grouped into summer, autumn, winter, and spring admissions based on their admission dates. Seasonality was studied by comparing the characteristics, bacteriological status, and outcomes of the patients admitted in different seasons. Results: The hospitalization rate of NF in Qatar was 2.9 per 100,000 population; in the study duration, this rate decreased from 2.8 to 1.6 per 100,000 population in 2002 and 2013, respectively. The mortality rate among NF cases increased from 1.9 to 3.6 per million population, and the CFR increased from 6.7 to 23 per 100 admissions in the same duration. No temporal trends in the hospitalization and mortality rates or CFR were evident in the study duration. Polybacterial infections were higher in autumn than in other seasons. Monobacterial Gram-positive infections were higher in spring than in other seasons, and monobacterial Gram-negative infections were higher in summer than in other seasons (p = 0.02). However, seasonality was not evident after further analysis in terms of species, severity, complications, length of hospital stays, and CFR in patients with NF. Conclusion: No clear trend or seasonality was observed in terms of outcomes; however, seasonality in NF-causing bacteria was evident, as polybacterial infections were significantly higher in autumn than in other seasons, whereas monobacterial infections were more frequent in spring and summer than in other seasons. However, the severity of infections, length of hospital stay, and mortality did not significantly vary. Further microbiological studies are needed to obtain confirmatory data regarding the temporal and seasonal trends of NF."

    "title": "Second trimester rupture uterus, unusual presentation.",
    "abstract": "Spontaneous uterine rupture before onset of labour is extremely rare. This is even more so in the second trimester of pregnancy, in nulliparous women and in the absence of myometrial surgery. The initial presentation of this potentially catastrophic event may be non-specific, with upper or lower abdominal discomfort, vague gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms preceding rapid deterioration. This case report demonstrates that a high index of suspicion, rapid diagnosis aided by imaging modalities and immediate surgical intervention are crucial steps in successful management. A postulated etiology in our patient is that of an upper scar from a previous uterine curettage with abnormal placentation predisposing to spontaneous rupture. A case of spontaneous uterine rupture at 16 week's gestation in a multiparous, 32 year old patient with no history of myometrial surgery. She had presented with lower abdominal discomfort, progressing to severe pain with hypotension and tachycardia. An urgent ultrasound pelvis showed a live fetus, free intra-peritoneal fluid with blood clots. An emergency laparotomy performed revealed 2 L of hemoperitoneum, with the fetus intact in the amniotic sac. The uterine fundal rupture was successfully repaired. Despite the gestation, in women presenting with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute abdomen and hemodynamic instability, prompt resuscitation must be instituted, and a high index of suspicion for rupture must be suspected."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is a rare, life-threatening clinical entity with an overall incidence of about 1:30,000 in spontaneous natural conception cases, especially in cases of delayed diagnosis or conflicting clinical features. Here, we present an unusual case of heterotopic pregnancy in a 22-year-old multigravida presented to the emergency department (ED) with a clinical picture of the acute abdomen following recent abdominal trauma. Abdominal ultrasound revealed hemoperitoneum and a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at seven weeks' gestation. Following surgical exploration, the patient underwent removal of the ectopic pregnancy tissue with right salpingectomy. Since the presence of a conflicting history or equivocal physical signs and symptoms makes it difficult to diagnose heterotopic pregnancy, ED physicians and surgeons must consider the diagnosis even when dealing with viable intrauterine pregnancies. Besides, acute abdominal pain associated with shock should be regarded as suggestive of heterotopic pregnancy. Thus, prompt evaluation and a high index of suspicion are of paramount importance to prevent unwanted sequelae."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency. There is no adequate information to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute appendicitis and its surgical management. The present comparative study reports successful appendectomy and infection control in patients with appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic and last year covering the same period. This retrospective observational study was conducted in acute appendicitis-treated patients from 13.03.19 to 13.05.19 and from 13.03.20 to 13.05.20, respectively. This study included 150 patients (110 patients in 2019; 40 patients in 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic)). The patients were named as Group A (Normal period) and Group B (Pandemic period), respectively. The groups were comparable as there was no significant difference between the mean age, mean BMI, and mean length of stay. There is a significant difference between the comorbidities of Group A and Group B (p=0.033). There was no significant difference between the laboratory and radiological findings of Group A and Group B. There was a significant difference between the perforation number of Group A and Group B (p=0.029). There was no significant difference between the needs of ICU and conversion from laparoscopic to conventional appendectomy of Group A and Group B. The findings obtained in this study suggest that late admission to the hospital caused complicated cases and made acute appendicitis management more difficult during the pandemic period, which was already a troubling period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the principles applied to emergency surgery for infected patients should be applied to both suspected and confirmed cases."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of non-obstetric acute abdomen in pregnant women. We examined the patients who were admitted to our emergency department with abdominal pain and diagnosed with acute appendicitis in the light of the literature. Seventeen pregnant patients with acute appendicitis who were admitted to the emergency department of Sanliurfa Training and Research Hospital between the years of 2016-2019 were retrospectively analyzed using an electronic recording system. Our patients were evaluated concerning age, gestational week, clinical status, the operation performed, ultrasonography results, pathology results, presence of additional diseases, laboratory results and hospital stay length. The mean age of our patients was 25.5 (18-41) years. Three patients were in the first trimester (17.6%), 11 patients were in the second trimester (64.8%), and three patients were in the third trimester (17.6%) at the time of admission. All of our patients had abdominal pain. Acute appendicitis was detected in 11 patients, while it was not detected in six patients on the USG examination. Two patients having term delivery underwent caesarean section with concurrent appendectomy. The mean hospital stay length was 2.9 (2-5) days. Histopathologically, 13 (86.7%) of our operated patients were diagnosed with appendicitis. No additional problems were observed in the mothers and infants in the postoperative period. Acute appendicitis should be considered as a non-obstetric pathology in pregnant patients admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain. We think that it is important for both maternal and infant health to examine this condition, which shows differences concerning clinical course and physical examination, with a meticulous and multidisciplinary approach."

Congenital and acquired factors play a role in its etiology. It is a rare condition and may cause life-threatening complications as torsion or infarction. Rarely, patients may present to the emergency department with an acute abdomen. They may also present with chronic abdominal pain or intraabdominal mass. Given that its clinical diagnosis is difficult to make, radiological studies have an important role for an accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we presented a 24-year-old patient with torsion of a wandering spleen who presented with an acute abdomen and underwent laparoscopic splenectomy under urgent conditions."

Emergency femoral artery thrombectomy can successfully treat this issue. However, polycythemia vera (PV) may sometimes explain this medical emergency. Recurrent thrombosis in the lower extremities after thrombectomy can be found in patients with PV, and reoperation is needed for this condition. A 68-year-old man in China suffered from sudden pain in the left lower extremity for 14 h. The examination in the emergency department showed a diagnosis of acute arterial embolism of the extremities combined with PV. The patient's complaint disappeared after repeat emergency thrombectomy. Patients with acute arterial embolism of the extremities should be treated carefully, especially those who have recurrent thrombosis after emergency thrombectomy. Clinicians should be aware of PV, a rare cause of acute arterial embolism of the extremities. The combination of thrombectomy, phlebotomy, and antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs may be a suitable therapeutic regimen for these patients."

    "abstract": "Torsion of an undescended testis (UT) is a surgical emergency, difficult to diagnose, whose prognosis depends on a quick management. To evaluate the management and outcome of these patients. We retrospectively analyzed all cases of UT torsion operated in nine French hospitals between 1997 and 2017. We divided patients in two groups: patients referred less than 6 h after the onset of symptoms (group A) or more than 6 h (group B). We collected 60 cases (17 in group A and 43 in group B). Median age was 2.2 years [IQR = 0.7-7.8] (2.3 y in group A and 2 y in group B, p = 0.76). Eleven patients (10 in group B) had neurological disorders (p = 0.15). The main reason for absence of UT treatment was the absence of surgical consultation in a normal delay (n = 44, 73%). Symptoms were pain (n = 58, 97%), inguinal mass (n = 55, 92%) and vomiting (n = 16, 27%). An inguinal mass with no palpable testis in the ipsilateral hemiscrotum was seen in 55 patients (92%). An ultrasound scan performed in 27 patients led to the diagnosis in 16 patients (59%). At surgery, an orchiectomy was performed in 4 patients (23%) of group A and 24 patients (56%) of group B (p = 0.04). After a median follow-up of 11 months [IQR = 4-23], 11 patients of group A (65%) and 7 patients of group B (16%) had a clinically normal testis (p = 0.03). The salvage rate among patients with conservative treatment was 85% for group A and 37% for group B (p = 0.01). Our study reveals that although UT torsion is an emergency, 72% of patients are referred more than 6 h after the onset of symptoms. We mostly found classic clinical presentation of UT torsion: a painful inguinal mass with an empty ipsilateral scrotum. Ultrasound was performed in half cases, and even if the result was not significant, it still seemed to be associated with a higher rate of orchiectomy especially in group B because of the delay in care. However, when ultrasound was realized early, it led to diagnosis in all cases. This dilemma poses the problem of the role of imaging in diagnostic management. Early clinical diagnosis in front of a painful inguinal mass with an empty scrotum is essential to improve the salvage rate of testis in UT torsion. Early management of UT should have avoided 68% of testis loss."

    "title": "Acute Diffuse Peritonitis Due to Spontaneous Rupture of an Infected Endometrioma: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Endometriosis is defined as a chronic, inflammatory, estrogen-dependent gynaecologic disease. It affects approximately 5-10% of reproductive-age women worldwide. Ovarian endometriosis is the most frequent form of this condition. Endometriotic cysts are found in about 17-44% of women diagnosed with endometriosis. It is well known, that ovarian endometriomas can cause infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Enlarging cysts can also cause ovarian torsion. In addition, ovarian endometriosis slightly increases the risk for ovarian cancer. The rupture of endometriotic ovarian cysts is an exceptional complication. According to the literature, the prevalence is less than 3% among women with endometriosis. The rupture of an ovarian endometrioma can cause acute peritonitis, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock and can be lethal. The occurrence of abscesses within an ovarian endometrioma is an extremely rare complication. Generally, the origin of infected endometriotic ovarian cysts is related to the previous invasive procedures involving pelvic organs or the use of intrauterine devices. Also, ovarian abscesses can be caused by the hematogenous or lymphatic spread of bacteria. Although, the literature points out that infection of endometriotic ovarian cysts can develop spontaneously. In these rare cases, reservoir and route of infection remains an enigma. A 49-year-old female was brought to the emergency room with severe generalized lower abdominal pain (6/10) and three days lasting fever. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain with anterior abdominal wall muscle tension. Painful solid masses were felt on both sides of the uterus during the pelvic examination. Cystic masses were detected in both ovaries during transvaginal sonography. Computer tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed abnormal changes in both ovaries. A small amount of free fluid was found in the pelvic cavity along with thickened pelvic peritoneum. Suspecting acute peritonitis and bilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses, surgical treatment was performed. Lower midline laparotomy with bilateral adnexectomy and abdominal lavage with 4000 ml normal saline were done. The outcome of peritonitis was evaluated using the Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI=17 - low risk of morbidity and mortality). The histopathological examination revealed the diagnosis of bilateral endometriotic cysts complicated with acute inflammation, with associated acute inflammation of both fallopian tubes. Microbiological cultures from the purulent fluid were negative. Although the occurrence of abscesses within an ovarian endometrioma is an extremely rare finding in clinical practice, it has to be considered by gynaecologists because it might result in a surgical emergency that can be life-threatening. Being aware of the risk factors of abscesses within an endometrioma can lead to an early diagnosis of this rare condition and help to avoid serious complications. Santrauka. Apžvalga.  Endometriozė yra lėtinė, recidyvuojanti, uždegiminė ginekologinė liga, nustatoma bendrosios populiacijos 5–10 proc. reprodukcinio amžiaus moterų. Dažniausia endometriozės forma yra kiaušidžių endometrioma, diagnozuojama 17–44 proc. atvejų. Dažniausios endometriozės komplikacijos yra nevaisingumas ir lėtinis dubens skausmas. Didėjančios endometrioidinės cistos gali sukelti kiaušidės apsisukimą. Be to, sergant kiaušidžių endometrioze, didėja rizika išsivystyti kiaušidžių vėžiui. Kiaušidžių endometrioidinių cistų plyšimas yra reta komplikacija, nustatoma mažiau nei 3 proc. moterų, sergančių endometrioze. Ši komplikacija gali sukelti ūminį peritonitą, sepsį, septinį šoką ar net mirtį. Mokslinėje literatūroje minima dar viena reta komplikacija – absceso formavimasis endometriomoje. Dažniausiai infekcija endometrioidinėse cistose išsivysto dėl dubens srityje atliktų invazinių procedūrų arba dėl netinkamo intrauterinių prietaisų naudojimo. Taip pat abscesų susidarymą kiaušidėse gali sukelti į endometriomą hematogeniniu arba limfogeniniu keliu patekę mikroorganizmai iš kitų organizme esančių infekcijos židinių. Mokslinės literatūros šaltiniuose yra aprašyta keletas itin retų atvejų, kai abscesas kiaušidžių endometriomoje susiformavo spontaniškai, be žinomų rizikos veiksnių, nepavykus identifikuoti infekcijos šaltinio. Atvejo aprašymas.  49 metų pacientė atvyko į skubios pagalbos skyrių dėl stipraus pilvo skausmo (6/10) ir tris dienas trunkančio subfebrilaus karščiavimo. Pilvo apčiuopos metu nustatytas viso pilvo ploto skausmingumas, jaučiami pilvaplėvės dirginimo ir priekinės pilvo sienos raumenų įtempimo simptomai. Taip pat abipus gimdos čiuopiami skausmingi, lygiu paviršiumi, vidutinio kietumo dariniai. Transvaginalinio ultragarsinio tyrimo metu dubenyje buvo matomi cistiniai dariniai abiejose kiaušidėse. Pilvo ir dubens organų kompiuterinėje tomografijoje rasta pokyčių abiejose kiaušidėse, taip pat buvo laisvo skysčio ir aiškiai infiltruota pilvaplėvė. Ginekologijos skyriuje pacientei skubos tvarka buvo atlikta apatinė išilginė laparotomija, kurios metu buvo rastas ūminis difuzinis pūlingas peritonitas ir abipusiai plyšę tuboovariniai abscesai, todėl pacientei buvo atlikta abipusė adneksektomija, kruopščiai išplauta pilvo ertmė. Operacijos metu pacientės būklė buvo įvertinta pagal Manheimo peritonito indeksą – nustatyta maža sergamumo ir mirtingumo rizika (MPI = 17). Pašalintos kiaušidės ir kiaušintakiai buvo nusiųsti histologiniam ištyrimui. Patohistologinio tyrimo metu buvo nustatytos abipusės endometrioidinės kiaušidžių cistos su ūminiu uždegimu ir ūminis abipusis kiaušintakių uždegimas. Mikrobiologiniame pasėlyje iš pūlingo pilvo ertmės skysčio bakterijų augimo nerasta. Išvados.  Kiaušidžių endometriomos infekcija yra itin retai aptinkamas reiškinys klinikinėje gydytojų akušerių-ginekologų praktikoje, tačiau svarbu mokėti šią patologiją diferencijuoti nuo kitų ūminio pilvo sindromo klinikinius simptomus sukeliančių ligų. Laiku nediagnozuoti gimdos priedų abscesai gali plyšti ir sukelti pacientės gyvybei pavojingą ūminę būklę, sepsį ar net septinį šoką. Svarbu žinoti rizikos veiksnius, galinčius sukelti abscesų formavimąsi kiaušidžių endometrioidinėse cistose, nes tai gali padėti laiku diagnozuoti šią patologiją ir išvengti sunkių komplikacijų.Raktažodžiai: infekuota endometrioma, kiaušidės abscesas, kiaušidės endometrioidinė cista, endometriozės komplikacijos."

This is a retrospective chart review of patients presenting with TT resulting from minor genital trauma that was performed from January 2010 to December 2018 at a single tertiary care institution. The demographic, clinical, and perioperative characteristics, as well as data on follow-up and complications, were analyzed. Of the 155 patients treated for TT, 15 were included in this study. The average age of the patients was 10.3 years (range: 3.2-13.3 years). All patients experienced a direct scrotal trauma and subsequently presented with an ipsilateral scrotal or testicular pain secondary to the twisted testicle. Six patients were misdiagnosed as having scrotal inflammation or hematoma, and all were initially treated at local hospitals. The mean duration of symptoms before hospitalization was 138 h (range: 5-504 h). The mean degree of torsion was 390° (range: 180-720°). The testicular salvation rate, at 33%, was poor. No serious postoperative complications or recurrences of TT was observed. TITT is a rare entity and still has delayed diagnosis. This may subsequently lead to a low testicular salvation rate. Emergency surgeons, especially in local hospitals, should be aware of the possibility of TT following testicular trauma in pediatric patients. Improving the parents' awareness regarding TT is also important."

    "abstract": "When deployed abroad, military surgeons frequently have to deal with casualties involving head trauma. The emergency treatments, as well as craniotomies, are often performed by non-neurosurgeons qualified with basic neurotraumatological skills. Previous neurotrauma courses for education of non-neurosurgeons in Germany teach surgical emergency skills but do not include the training of skills needed to successfully utilize imaging in surgical planning, which is of importance for the safety and success of the treatment. To overcome these limitations, 3D printed models of neurotrauma cases were fabricated for application in the training of non-neurosurgeons. Five models of actual neurotrauma cases from our neurosurgical department were segmented from CT scans and 3D printed using multi-part fused deposition modeling. Model quality was assessed with respect to the representation of pre-defined anatomical landmarks. The models were then fixed to a wooden mount with a central light source and covered by a latex mask for skin simulation. Surgical planning by means of craniometric measurements on the basis of available CT scans of the corresponding patients was then applied to the model. The 3D printed models precisely represented the cranium, the lesion, and anatomical landmarks, which are taken into consideration during surgical planning. Surface covering with washable latex masks ensured sufficient masking of the now non-noticeable lesion within the semi-translucent skull. Surgical planning was performed using washable marker drawings. When lighted, the otherwise non-visible lesion within the semi-translucent 3D printed craniums became visible and facilitated immediate success control for the course participants. The presented method provided a way to fabricate precise 3D models of neurotrauma cases, which are suitable to teach the application of medical imaging in surgical planning. For further benefit analysis, the application of the presented education tool needs to be investigated within a neurotrauma course."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection is a surgical emergency and management of such pathology can be complex with poor outcomes when there is organ malperfusion. Carotid artery involvement is present in 30% of patients diagnosed with acute type A aortic dissection, and given its emergency and complex nature, there is much controversy regarding the approach, extent of treatment, and timing of the intervention. It is clear that the occurrence of cerebral malperfusion adds an extra layer of complexity to the decision-making framework for treatment. Standardization and validation of the optimal management approach is required, and this should ideally be addressed with large-scale studies. Nonetheless, current literature supports the need for rapid recognition and diagnosis of acute type A aortic dissection with cerebral malperfusion, immediate and extensive surgical repair, and the appropriate use of cerebral perfusion techniques. This paper aims to discuss the current evidence regarding the impact of carotid artery involvement in both the management and outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV2 infection is associated with high mortality for individuals who undergo emergency surgery. The United Kingdom surgical associations and Colleges of Surgeons collectively recommended the addition of CT Thorax to all emergency CT abdomen/pelvis imaging in order to help identify possible COVID-19 patients. Early identification of these patients would lead to optimal treatment strategies for the patient and protection for staff members. However, an extension of CT would be associated with increased irradiation doses for the patient, and its diagnostic relevance was unclear. This was a retrospective observational review looking at all surgical admissions that required a CT Thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis across 7 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic, across four Scottish Hospitals. CT thorax investigations (of non-surgical patients) were also re-assessed by a single radiologist to assess the extent of pathology identified at the lung bases (and therefore would be included in a standard CT abdomen and pelvis). Of 216 patients identified who had a CT thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis during the timeframe, 5 were diagnosed with COVID-19. During this timeframe, 77 patients underwent solely CT thorax. Across the entire cohort, 98% of COVID pathology was identified at the lung bases. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of CT thorax was 60 and 86.4% respectively. In a region with relatively low prevalence of SARS-COV2 infection, inclusion of CT Thorax in surgical admission imaging does not significantly contribute to identification and management of SARS-COV2 patients. We therefore suggest that imaging the lung bases can be sufficient to raise clinical suspicion of COVID-19. This paper adds further evidence to that from other single UK centres that the addition of CT chest for all patients does not yield any further diagnostic information regarding coronavirus. Additionally, rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in the UK (which is currently widely available) further demonstrates that inclusion of the entire chest during CT examination of the acute abdomen is not required."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication of an intrauterine pregnancy with a simultaneous ectopic pregnancy. There is a higher incidence with assisted reproduction techniques (ART) and radiology can be pivotal in its diagnosis. A 28-year-old woman underwent ART and at 7 weeks' gestation presented with acute right iliac fossa pain. Transvaginal ultrasound (US) imaging confirmed a viable intrauterine pregnancy. The patients' pain persisted however, and transabdominal US demonstrated a complex, heterogeneous right adnexal mass. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an HP with a ruptured ectopic and haemoperitoneum. Emergency laparoscopic surgery and right salpingo-oopherectomy were performed without complication. We highlight the importance of considering HP as a diagnosis in the acute gravid abdomen, especially when initial investigations have confirmed a viable intrauterine pregnancy. Furthermore, this case highlights MRI as a useful modality in complex cases due to its high soft tissue contrast resolution using non-ionising radiation."

    "abstract": "Appendicitis is a common pediatric surgical emergency, and the diagnosis may be delayed or missed because of nonspecific findings in children. Not all patients with abdominal pain need to be imaged for appendicitis, and laboratory evaluation may improve diagnostic accuracy in this population. To determine if C-reactive protein (CRP) and symptom duration could be used to improve diagnosis of appendicitis compared with white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC). This was a retrospective chart review from June 2017 to 2019 at our tertiary academic children's hospital. A consecutive sample of all children <18 years of age being evaluated for appendicitis who had magnetic resonance imaging ordered were included. The diagnostic accuracy of WBC, ANC, and CRP were compared for patients with symptom duration ≤1 day compared with symptom duration for >1 day. Five hundred thirty-nine patients were identified. The sensitivity and specificity of WBC (10,000 cells/μL) was 87.1% and 65.2%, respectively; ANC (7,500 cells/μL) was 86.5% and 70.8%, respectively; and CRP (0.5 mg/dL) were 73.7% and 58.1%, respectively. At >1 day of symptom duration, the specificity of WBC and ANC increased to 74.9% and 80.9%, respectively, and the sensitivity of CRP increased to 88.9%. Three patients with appendicitis (2.8%) had no laboratory abnormalities. No laboratory test studied has adequate characteristics to be used alone. CRP adds minimal sensitivity beyond WBC and ANC when symptoms are >1 day but with poor specificity, making it of limited utility."

    "title": "[Clinical characteristics and management of Petersen hernia after gastrectomy in patients with gastric cancer].",
    "abstract": "Objective: Petersen hernia is a rare but severe complication after gastrectomy, which has been reported by very few studies. This study is dedicated to summarize the clinical characteristics and management of Petersen hernia after gastrectomy in patients with gastric cancer in order to provide reference to clinical practice. Methods: A descriptive case-control study was carried out. All the qualified patients were screened from the database of digestive malignancies in Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Petersen hernia confirmed during operation; previous gastrectomy history due to gastric cancer; complete clinical data. The clinical manifestation, perioperative data and follow-up outcome were summarized. Results: A total of 12 qualified patients were included. They were all male with a mean age of (65.3±8.5) years old, and whose clinical presentation had last for (6~143) hours (median: 21 hours). Common complaints included abdominal pain and bloating. All the patients were admitted to the emergency department. Preoperative CT showed dilatation and effusion of small intestine. Other imaging manifestations included whirlpool sign, target sign, mesenteric retraction or congestion and edema, abdominal and pelvic effusion, etc. Hematological examination showed white blood cell count, ratio of neutrophils, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein were higher than the normal range. The median interval to previous gastrectomy is 20.5 (0.5-55.0) months. The previous gastrectomy of 12 cases included 2 cases of laparoscopic surgery and 10 of laparotomies. Ten cases underwent emergency surgery immediately, and 2 cases underwent surgery after ineffective conservative treatment. Six cases received small bowel restoration without bowel resection, and the other 6 cases received small bowel resection with a mean length of 76 (11~300) cm. Six cases were transferred into ICU with a stay of (2.5±0.8) days. One case deceased at postoperative day 2, due to subtotal small bowel resection, and the other 11 cases survived without grade III or above complication according to Clavien-Dindo classification. The overall postoperative hospitalization was (9.2±3.6) days. During the postoperative follow-up, no acute gastrointestinal symptoms or acute abdomen recurred. Conclusions: Petersen hernia is more common in male, whose onset and progress are rapid and emergent, and prognosis is poor. 目的： Petersen疝是胃癌胃切除术后少见但严重的并发症。但目前国内外对Petersen疝的报道十分有限。因此，本文总结胃癌胃切除术后Petersen疝的临床特征和治疗方式，为临床诊治提供参考。 方法： 本研究采用描述性病例系列研究方法。通过南京大学医学院附属鼓楼医院消化道肿瘤数据库，筛选自2010年1月至2019年12月期间收治的Petersen疝患者。病例纳入标准：经术中证实为Petersen疝；既往接受过胃癌切除术；临床资料完整。分析总结本组Petersen疝临床表现、围手术期情况及治疗后随访情况。 结果： 全组12例患者均为男性，年龄（65.3±8.5）岁，中位发病时长21（6~143）h，常见主诉包括腹痛和腹胀。所有患者均为急诊入院，术前CT均表现为小肠扩张积液，其他影像学表现包括漩涡征、靶征、肠系膜回缩或充血水肿、腹盆腔积液等。血液学检查显示患者白细胞计数、中性粒细胞比例、降钙素原及C反应蛋白均高于正常范围。距上次胃切除术20.5（0.5~55.0）个月，胃切除术式为腹腔镜手术2例，开放手术10例。10例即刻接受了急诊手术，2例经保守治疗无效后行手术治疗。6例经小肠复位后血供恢复未行小肠切除，另6例术中证实小肠坏死行部分小肠切除术，中位切除长度为76（11~300）cm。6例术后转入重症监护室，重症监护室住院天数为（2.5±0.8）d；1例因小肠广泛坏死行小肠次全切除术，术后2 d死亡；其他11例术后均未发生Clavien-Dindo分级Ⅲ级或以上并发症；全组患者术后总住院时间（9.2±3.6）d。术后随访，均未再出现急性消化道症状或急腹症。 结论： 胃癌术后Petersen疝发病急、进展快，多集中于男性，预后不良。."

We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample database from 2009 through the first three-quarters of 2015 of patients aged ≥65 years who were malnourished and underwent major abdominal surgery for the acute abdomen within the first 2 days of hospital admission. Of 3 246 721 patients analyzed, 4311 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, only 507 (11.8%) patients had surgical nutritional access (gastrostomy or jejunostomy) (group I), while 3804 patients (88.2%) did not (group II). In the propensity score-matched population, there were 482 patients in each group. The patients in group I had lower odds of mortality and postoperative gastrointestinal complications (paralytic ileus, anastomotic dehiscence, and intestinal fistulae) (P-value <.01, respectively).

    "abstract": "Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare disease associated with mucinous ascites. Pseudomyxoma peritonei has a low incidence and is difficult to diagnose. Pseudomyxoma peritonei usually presents with vague abdominal pain after significant progression. Computed tomography imaging is the most common modality for diagnosis; however, diagnosis as a result of surgical intervention in cases of acute abdomen has become increasingly common. We present a unique case of a 66-year-old man who was incidentally diagnosed with PMP after undergoing an emergent splenectomy for presumed blunt trauma. The patient presented to the emergency room with abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. Computed tomography imaging revealed a splenic hematoma with suspicion of extravasation and a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal fluid consistent with blood. The patient was taken to the operating room emergently for an emergent splenectomy where splenic laceration was noted, as were multiple areas of nodularity in the omentum and cecum. Histologic evaluation of these lesions led to the diagnosis of PMP. After recovery from his initial splenectomy, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, cytoreductive surgery, cholecystectomy, removal of appendiceal mucocele, and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy without complication. Final pathology was consistent with PMP and primary mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma. This case highlights an unusual presentation of PMP for a patient who was undergoing surgery for presumed splenic trauma. Surgeons must maintain a high index of suspicion and should perform histological evaluation when such unexpected findings are encountered."

    "title": "[The role of laparoscopy in the treatment of perforated gastro-duodenal ulcers].",
    "abstract": "Introduction: The incidence of peptic ulcer disease decreased due to proton pump inhibitors and Helicobacter pylori eradication. Bleeding from peptic ulcer decreased, as well, although perforation did not decrease and it is permanently between 2–10%. This is a potential surgical emergency, the mortality can reach up to 25% and the morbidity 50%, respectively. Urgent surgical intervention in the right time can improve the results. Aim: To compare the morbidity, mortality, the length of hospital stay and duration of operating time in open and laparoscopic repair of perforated peptic ulcer. Results: A cohort of 55 patients were operated on with perforated peptic ulcer from 01.01.2017 to 30.06.2019 31 open (51.36%) and 24 laparoscopic (43.63%) operations were performed from which 4 (16.6%) needed conversion to open approach. The average age of 23 men and 8 women were 56.3 and 70.3 years respectively in the open operations group, while 13 men and 11 women with average age of 49.7 and 53.7 years was in the laparoscopic operations group. Within 30 days the number of complications were 5 in the open and 2 in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.45). The average duration of operation was 51.95 minutes (30–85) in the open and 63.41 minutes (25–110) in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.13). 6 from the open group with average age of 74.3 years and 2 from the laparoscopic group with average age of 68.5 years died within 30 days (p = 0.44). The average length of stay was 7.13 (5–16) days in the open and 6.19 (4–13) days in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.24). The average size of the perforation was 7.4 mm (3–20) in the open and 5.3 mm (3–10) in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.14). Free air was seen in the abdominal cavity in 25 cases (80%) of the open and in 11 cases (54%) of the laparoscopic group. Conclusion: Early diagnosis, prompt supportive care and antibiotic treatment and urgent surgical intervention are essential to improve outcomes. The standard operation is the simple suture with pedicled omental flap which can be performed by either open or laparoscopic surgical repair. Laparoscopic method spreads slowly, the learning curve is longer and it needs more expertise but the morbidity is lower than that of the open surgery. The morbidity does not increase after conversion according to the literature so if there is no contraindication and there is enough expertise it should be suggested as the first choice. Összefoglaló. Bevezetés: A protonpumpagátló kezelés és Helicobacter pylori eradikáció következtében a fekélyincidencia csökkent, a fekélyből származó vérzések száma is csökkent, ellenben a perforációk előfordulása változatlanul 2–10% között van. A perforáció egy potenciálisan fatális sebészi sürgősségi helyzet, a mortalitás elérheti a 25%-ot, a morbiditás pedig az 50%-ot. Az időben végzett sürgős sebészi kezelés javíthatja az eredményeket. Célkitűzés: A fekélyperforáció nyitott és laparoszkópos módon történt ellátásának összehasonlítása a morbiditás, mortalitás, műtéti idő és ápolási idő alapján. Eredmények: 2017. 01. 01. és 2019. 06. 30. között 55 műtét történt gastro-duodenális fekélyperforáció miatt, 31 műtétet (56,36%) nyitott és 24 műtétet (43,63%) pedig laparoszkópos módon végeztünk. A laparoszkópos csoportban 4 konverzió történt (16,6%). A nyitott műtéti csoportban 23 férfi (átlagéletkor 56,3 év) és 8 nő volt (átlagéletkor 70,3 év), míg a laparoszkópos csoportban 13 férfi (átlagéletkor 49,7 év) és 11 nő (átlagéletkor 53,7 év) volt. A nyitott csoportban 5, a laparoszkópos csoportban 2 szövődmény fordult elő (p = 0,45). Az átlagos műtéti idő a nyitott műtétnél 51,95 perc (30–85), míg a laparoszkópos műtétnél 63,41 (25–110) perc volt (p = 0,13). A nyitott csoportból 6 (átlagéletkor 74,3 év), a laparoszkópos csoportból pedig 2 (átlagéletkor 68,5 év) beteget veszítettünk el 30 napon belül (p = 0,44). Az átlagos ápolási idő a nyitott csoportban 7,13 (5–16), a laparoszkópos csoportban pedig 6,19 (4–13) napnak bizonyult (p = 0,24). Az átlagos perforációméret a nyitott műtéti csoportban 7,4 mm (3–20 mm), míg a laparoszkópos műtéti csoportban 5,3 mm (3–10 mm) volt (p = 0,14). Szabad levegő natív hasi röntgenvizsgálaton a nyitott csoportban 25 esetben (80%), míg a laparoszkópos csoportban 13 esetben volt látható (54%). Megbeszélés: A korai diagnózis, az azonnal kezdett szupportív és antibiotikus kezelés és a sürgős műtét elengedhetetlen az eredmények javításához. A standard műtét a sutura csepleszlebennyel, amit lehet nyitottan és laparoszkóppal is végezni. Bár a viszonylag kis esetszám miatt anyagunkban nem sikerült igazolni a szövődmények arányának szignifikáns csökkenését, az irodalmi adatok alapján a laparoszkópos beavatkozásnak kisebb a morbiditása, mint a nyílt műtétnek, és ha nincs ellenjavallata a laparoszkópiának (anamnézisben többszörös hasi műtét, nem kellő laparoszkópos gyakorlat, felvételkori sokkos állapot és magas életkor), a laparoszkópia általános előnyei miatt és a szabadlevegő-hiány okozta diagnosztikus bizonytalanság esetén is a laparoszkópia első választásként javasolható."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection, according to Stanford classification, is a surgical emergency with high morbidity and carries 56% of in-hospital mortality when surgical intervention is not performed. The surgical mortality at 30 days is 10 to 20%. The therapeutic goals are to replace the diseased ascending aorta and to treat or to monitor the distal aortic patent false lumen. When the dissection involves the aortic root and the architecture of aortic valve is normal, the surgical techniques used could be multiple: reinforce the aortic root and spare the native aortic valve or replace the aortic valve and the aortic root. The Florida sleeve technique has been developed to treat the aortic aneurysm, sparing the aortic valve in patients with connective tissue disease. Some case reports have described the use of this technique to treat an acute aortic dissection. In the following case, we present a single stage repair of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and proximal intrathoracic aorta in a patient with Type A aortic dissection through the contemporaneous use of two techniques: Florida sleeve and Vascutek \"Thoraflex\" hybrid prosthesis. The use of these two techniques allows the repair/replacement of the proximal intrathoracic aorta, the sparing of the native aortic valve, the employment of a hybrid prosthesis to replace the supraortic vessels, and the creation of a descending aortic landing zone for later, distal intervention."

Several scoring algorithms have been used to establish the expected mortality in these patients. Our objective was to define the predictive factors for mortality in our center and to validate the EuroSCORE and Penn classification system. Patients who underwent surgery for AAD from 2006 to 2016 were retrieved from the institution's database. Preoperative, operative and postoperative variables were collected. Observed and expected mortality was calculated by EuroSCORE. Logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to find predictors of operative mortality and survival, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for logistic EuroSCORE, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated. 87 patients (27.6% female) underwent surgery for AAD. The mean age was 58.6±9.7 years. Expected and observed operative mortality was 25.8±15.1% and 20.7%, respectively. Penn Aa, Ab and Abc shared similar observed/expected (O/E) mortality ratio. The only independent predictor of operative mortality (OR: 3.63; 95% CI: 1.19-11.09) and survival (HR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.5-4.8) was female gender. EuroSCORE showed a very poor prediction capacity, with an AUC=0.566. Female gender was the only independent predictor of operative mortality and survival in our institution. EuroSCORE is a poor scoring algorithm to predict mortality in AAD, but with consistent results for Penn Aa, Ab and Abc."

A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated free air and hyperdense round structures in the stomach, pelvic cavity and right paracolic gutter. During emergency laparotomy a traumatic gastric perforation was sutured, a splenic rupture was treated with a vicryl mesh and multiple spherical food scraps were removed from the abdomen. After surgery, the boy clarified that he had eaten a whole bag of colorful and spherical shaped candy just before the accident. Traumatic gastric rupture in children is rare but physicians should be aware of this diagnosis in case of blunt abdominal trauma with free air on the CT scan. Gastric contents, in this case candy, can present as hyperdense shaped structures in the abdominal cavity on the CT scan."

Descriptive observational study with a cross-sectional design based on data from the emergency/urgency appendectomy records between September 2018 and April 2019. Variables of interest were considered based on intrinsic patient data, clinical status, and perioperative management factors. Primary outcomes considered: postoperative complications from hospital admission discharge and prolonged hospital stay for > 2 days. Secondary outcome: death. The results were evaluated by Fisher's exact test (p <0.05). We identified 48 patients undergoing an appendectomy. Young adults accounted for 68.7%. From the total, 58.3% were males, 6 (12.5%) had hospitalization> 2 days, 4 (8.3%) had complications and no deaths. Among the variables, the stage of AA, the time of complaint up until seeking care, and advanced age were correlated with worse prognosis during hospitalization (p <0.05). The emergence of immediate postoperative complications was correlated with longer hospital stay (p <0.05). The descriptive data of the sample converge with the epidemiological profile of patients with AA in the literature, corroborating the applicability of conventional guidelines. The results strengthen the hypothesis that the patient's flow with abdominal manifestations is complicated from the first contact with SUS to the resolution of the condition. Knowledge of the epidemiological profile and perioperative predictors that are most related to complications favor the appropriate management of patients."

The aim of reporting this case is to highlight this surgical emergency in terms of clinical presentations, surgical management and outcomes. A 68 year-old male with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic constipation on daily laxatives presented to the emergency department with a diffuse abdominal pain and distention for 4 days associated with vomiting and absence of defecation where he was prescribed phosphate rectal enemas. Patient was in sepsis with generalized abdominal tenderness and distention. Intraoperative findings of feculent peritonitis with isolated cecal perforation was identified, for which a right hemicolectomy with end ileostomy was performed. The first case was described in a woman presented with spontaneous rectum rupture by Brodie in 1827, with a less than 100 cases being reported in literature. In 1984, spontaneous perforations were classified into either \"stercoral\" or \"idiopathic\" perforations. More than 60% of colonic perforations were reported in the sigmoid or at the recto-sigmoid junction, mainly at the anti-mesenteric border, making spontaneous cecal perforation a very uncommon condition. Cecal perforation is associated with high mortality in the range of 30%-72%. The outcome of SPC depends on multiple factors like onset of perforation, peritoneal contamination, and time of intervention. Regardless the surgical technique, early detection and surgical management are the main strategies associated with improving the outcomes."

We present the case of self-inflicted impalement with intestinal perforation in a 44-year-old man, who attends the emergency department without the cause of the injury and with an acute abdomen, due to hemoperitoneum, fecal peritonitis and a perforation in the rectosigmoid junction."

    "title": "Impact of Surgery on Older Patients Hospitalized With an Acute Abdomen: Findings From the Older Persons Surgical Outcome Collaborative.",
    "abstract": "Background: The impact of surgery compared to non-surgical management of older general surgical patients is not well researched. Methods: We examined the association between management and adverse outcomes in a cohort of emergency general surgery patients aged > 65 years. This multi-center study included 727 patients (mean+/-SD, 77.1 ± 8.2 years, 54% female) admitted to five UK hospitals. Data were analyzed using multi-level crude and multivariable logistic regression. Outcomes were: mortality at Day 30 and 90, length of stay, and readmission within 30 days of discharge. Covariates assessed were management approach, age, sex, frailty, polypharmacy, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Results: Approximately 25% of participants (n = 185) underwent emergency surgery. Frailty and albumin were associated with mortality at 30 (frailty OR = 3.52 [95% CI 1.66-7.49], albumin OR = 3.78 ([95% CI 1.53-9.31]), and 90 days post discharge (frailty OR = 3.20 [95% CI 1.86-5.51], albumin OR=3.25 [95% CI 1.70-6.19]) and readmission (frailty OR = 1.56 [95% CI (1.04-2.35)]). Surgically managed patients and frailty had increased odds of prolonged hospitalization (surgery OR = 5.69 [95% CI 3.67-8.80], frailty OR = 2.17 [95% CI 1.46-3.23]). Conclusion: We found the impact of surgery on length of hospitalization in older surgical patients is substantial. Whether early comprehensive geriatric assessment and post-op rehabilitation would improve this outcome require further evaluation."

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to analyse the changes that occurred after the COVID-19 pandemic using the data of EMS of Ankara province. EMS data for the same time interval (March 11-April 24) in the last 3 years (2018, 2019 and 2020) were compared. While the number of calls increased by 90.9% during the pandemic period (from 2019 to 2020), the number of cases increased by 9.8%. Of all cases transported to hospital, 15.2% were suspected of and 2.9% were diagnosed with COVID-19. In the pandemic period, case frequency decreased in the 0-6 age group (-4.1%) and 7-18 age group (-39.9%) while the number of patients in the 19-65 age group (12.9%) and 65+ age group (21.5%) increased. There was a statistically significant difference between pre-pandemic and pandemic period in terms of rural area case frequency. During the pandemic period, case frequency of angina pectoris (-35.2%), myocardial infarction (-45%), acute abdomen (-23.8%) and cerebrovascular diseases (-2.9%) decreased contrary to pre-pandemic period (2019). During the same period, symptoms of fever (+14.1%) and cough (+956.3%) increased. There was a statistically significant difference between pre-pandemic and pandemic period in terms of forensic case frequency (P < .05). In addition, there was a statistically significant difference between these periods in terms of the frequency of patients who died at the scene. Although the use of ambulances has increased in the pandemic process, the use of EMS for time-sensitive diseases has decreased."

    "abstract": "During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, German health care centres were restructured for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This was accompanied by the suspension of the surgical programme. The aim of the survey was to determine the effects of COVID-19 on surgical care in non-university hospitals in Germany. This cross-sectional study was based on an anonymous online survey, which was accessible from April 24th to May 10th, 2020 for surgeons of the Konvent der leitenden Krankenhauschirurgen (Convention of leading Hospital Surgeons) in Germany. The analysis comprised of 22.8% (n = 148/649) completed surveys. Communication and cooperation with authorities, hospital administration and other departments were largely considered sufficient. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 28.4% (n = 42/148) of the respondents complained about a short supply of protective equipment available for the hospital staff. 7.4% (n = 11/148) of the participants stated that emergency operations had to be postponed or rescheduled. A decreased quantity of emergency surgical procedures and a decreased number of surgical emergency patients treated in the emergency room was reported in 43.9% (n = 65/148) and 63.5% (n = 94/148), respectively. Consultation and treatment of oncological patients in the outpatient clinic was decreased in 54.1% (n = 80/148) of the surveyed hospitals. To increase the capacity for COVID-19 patients, a reduction of bed and operating room occupancy of 50.8 ± 19.3% and 54.2 ± 19.1% were reported, respectively. Therefore, 90.5% (n = 134/148) of all participants expected a loss of revenue of 28.2 ± 12.9% in 2020. The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on surgical care in Germany. The reduction in the bed and the operating room capacity may have lead to considerable delays in urgent and semi-elective surgical interventions. In addition to the risk of worsening patient care, we anticipate severe financial damage to the clinics in 2020 and beyond. National and supranational planning is urgently needed to ensure the surgical care of patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."

We present the case of a 79-year-old Caucasian male with acute renal dysfunction and incarcerated inguinoscrotal hernia containing the entire urinary bladder. The patient presented in the surgical emergency department due to an incarcerated right inguinoscrotal hernia and deteriorated renal function. Preoperatively, ultrasound imaging was performed, which showed the presence of the whole bladder in the hernia sac. The bladder was repositioned to its anatomic position and hernia was repaired through a modified Lichtenstein technique. In patients with inguinoscrotal hernia and acute urinary tract symptoms, surgeons should be aware of the possibility of inguinal bladder hernia.

    "abstract": "Patients with spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection (SISMAD) usually present with acute or chronic abdominal pain and are admitted to the emergency or digestive diseases department to undergo auxiliary examinations, typically abdominal plain CT or contrast-enhanced CT (CECT). Plain CT is the most crucial examination in emergency radiology. An enlarged SMA diameter and perivascular fat stranding (PFS) on plain CT, though non-specific, may be the only indications for SISMAD. These results may be easily overlooked and the diagnosis of SISMAD may be missed. However, PFS around the SMA on CT may be the only indicator of the possible presence of SISMAD, particularly during the early stage when there are no massive changes in the vascular wall. The present study aimed to determine whether PFS surrounding the SMA on CT may help with the diagnosis of SISMAD by indicating the requirement for further examination. The data of 161 consecutive patients with SMA dissection who underwent abdominal CECT or underwent SMA CT angiography (CTA) after abdominal plain CT between February 2015 and February 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. SMA diameter, classification, PFS, complications, comorbidities and treatments were analyzed. The results demonstrated that SISMAD with PFS was significantly associated with admission type (emergency), clinical manifestations (abdominal pain), diagnostic modality and dissection subtype. On plain CT, PFS surrounding the SMA may be a marker for SISMAD, particularly in the emergency setting, and indicates the requirement for CTA examination."

The bullet entered through the skin midline over the navel area, passed through the stomach perforating the vena cava and, by breaking the right pedicle of L4, moved inside the vertebral canal (bridging the cauda equina) stopping just in front of the body of S2. Because of the sudden onset of acute abdomen due to a massive retroperitoneal hematoma, the patient underwent emergency explorative laparotomy with the evacuation of the hematoma and the suture of the perforated cava vein, the peritoneum, and the stomach. No neurological deficits were observed after the gunshot. Two weeks later, the patient underwent spinal surgery to remove the bullet from the spinal canal, which was performed successfully without any instrumentation and with no onset of new neurological signs and symptoms or surgery-related complications. Patient was discharged on day 9 after surgery in good general conditions."

    "abstract": "Acute cholecystitis (AC) is a common surgical emergency. The Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) provides a reliable algorithm for the treatment of AC patients to achieve optimal outcomes. However, the economic benefits have not been validated. We hypothesize that good outcomes and cost savings can both be achieved if patients are treated according to the TG18. This retrospective study included 275 patients who underwent cholecystectomy in a 15-month span. Patients were divided into three groups (group 1: mild AC; group 2: moderate AC with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class ≤ 2 and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score ≤ 5; and group 3: moderate AC with ASA class ≥ 3, CCI score ≥ 6, or severe AC). Each group was further divided into two subgroups according to management (followed or deviated from the TG18). Patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and hospital costs were compared. For group 1 patients, 77 (81%) were treated according to the TG18 and had a significantly higher successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) rate (100%), lower hospital cost ($1896 vs $2388), and shorter hospital stay (2.9 vs 8 days) than those whose treatment deviated from the TG18. For group 2 patients, 50 (67%) were treated according to the TG18 and had a significantly lower hospital cost ($1926 vs $2856), shorter hospital stay (3.9 vs 9.9 days), and lower complication rate (0% vs 12.5%). For group 3 patients, 62 (58%) were treated according to the TG18 and had a significantly lower intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate (9.7% vs 25%), but a longer hospital stay (12.6 vs 7.8 days). However, their hospital costs were similar. Early LC in group 3 patients did not have economic benefits over gallbladder drainage and delayed LC. The TG18 are the state-of-the-art guidelines for the treatment of AC, achieving both satisfactory outcomes and cost-effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Majority of compartment syndromes are associated with trauma or surgery. Spontaneous compartment syndrome in multiple limbs is rare and alternative diagnosis should be sought. We report a young adult man who developed compartment syndrome in all four limbs sequentially over 4 years. On further evaluation, he was found to have a gene mutation in exon 3 of GYG1 gene. Spontaneous compartment syndrome in patients with GYG1 gene mutation does not appear to have been previously recognised. Although a direct causality cannot be confidently drawn, this gene is involved in muscle energy utilisation and is known to cause metabolic defect. Acute compartment syndrome, once diagnosed, warrants emergency surgical decompression. The subsequent management of spontaneous compartment syndrome demands a thorough medical assessment to identify any underlying metabolic or genetic predisposition."

    "abstract": "Paragangliomas (PGLs) are extremely rare neuroendocrine tumours arising from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells. PGLs are clinically rare, difficult to diagnose and usually require surgical intervention. PGLs mostly present catecholamine-related symptoms. We report a case of Acute abdomen as the initial manifestation of haemorrhagic retroperitoneal PGL. There has been only one similar case reported in literature. We present a unique case of a 52-year-old female with acute abdomen induced by haemorrhagic retroperitoneal PGL. The patient had a 5-h history of sudden onset of serve right lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the right flank and right lumbar region. Patient had classic symptoms of acute abdomen. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a large abdominal mass with a clear boundary. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of superior mesenteric artery was also performed to in the emergency department. The CTA demonstrated a large retroperitoneal mass measured 9.0 × 7.3 cm with higher density inside. A provisional diagnosis of retroperitoneal tumour with haemorrhage was made. The patient received intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics and somatostatin. On the 3rd day of admission, her abdominal pain was slightly relieved, but haemoglobin decreased from 10.9 to 9.4 g/dL in 12 h suggesting that there might be active bleeding in the abdominal cavity. Thus, we performed a midline laparotomy for the patient. Haemorrhage was successfully stopped during operation. The retroperitoneal tumour with haemorrhage was completely removed. The abdominal pain was significantly relieved after surgery. The patient initially presented with acute abdomen instead of catecholamine-related symptoms. The diagnosis of retroperitoneal PGL with haemorrhage was finally confirmed by postoperative pathological and immunohistochemical results. The postoperative course was uneventful. At the 1-year follow-up visit, no tumour recurrence was observed by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography. A literature review was performed to further understand and analyse the aforementioned disease. Acute abdomen as the initial manifestation of haemorrhagic retroperitoneal paraganglioma is extremely rare. Abdominal Computed Tomography is essential to locate the lesion and differentiate between other causes of acute abdomen. PGLs are hypervascular tumours. We should be aware that ruptured retroperitoneal PGL with massive bleeding could be life threatening and require emergency laparotomy."

Parenchymal rupture usually occurs in patients with renal cell carcinoma, angiomyolipoma, renal cysts, arteriovenous malformation or vascular diseases such as periarteritis nodosa. Collecting system rupture is usually a rare complication of obstructive urolithiasis. We describe the unusual cases of spontaneous kidney rupture in patients with acute urinary obstruction. The case report describes the left parenchymal kidney explosion related to ipsilateral ureteral obstruction caused by a single ureteral stone. The patient reached our emergency department with acute left flank pain and massive haematuria. At the moment of admission, the patient was in stage III hypovolemic shock and had a lower haematocrit (haemoglobin = 4.9 g/dL). Despite blood transfusions, emergency surgical exploration, extrafascial nephrectomy and intensive support care, the patient died twelve hours after surgery. Parenchymal renal rupture can be a life-threatening emergency. Despite its rarity, in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, parenchymal renal rupture should always be considered in patients with abdominal pain and an anamnesis or history of urinary stones, pointing out the need of early diagnosis also in benign urological conditions."

    "abstract": "Penile fracture (PF) is a surgical emergency. Given its rarity, we queried a national cohort over an 11-year period to study the temporal and demographic variations in presentation, evaluation, and management of patients with PF compared with a cohort of control patients. The National Inpatient Sample was queried between the years 2005 and 2016 for patients with a diagnosis of PF. Appendectomy patients were selected as a control cohort, given the non-discriminatory nature of this disease. Clinical and demographic data of the patients were compared with that of controls. Presenting symptoms, rates of surgical repair, and rates of associated surgical procedures were evaluated in the PF cohort. During the study period, 5802 patients were hospitalized for PF. The annual incidence of PF remained unchanged at 1.0-1.8 cases per 100 000 hospitalizations over the study period. Compared with the control cohort, PF patients were more likely to be younger (38.7 years vs 41.2 years, P ≤ 0.001), have lower rates of comorbidities except erectile dysfunction (1.4% vs 0.1%, P ≤ 0.001), and were more likely of Black race (25.4% vs 6.2%, P ≤ 0.001). Notably, PF patients had significantly higher rates of substance abuse (26.4% vs 18.1%, P ≤ 0.001), despite no difference in the diagnosed psychiatric disorders. PF rarely presented with hematuria (3.5%); however, urethral evaluation was performed in 23.1%, most commonly with cystoscopy (19.2%). PF occurs more commonly in a younger, healthier male population, and among minorities. Importantly, rates of substance abuse appear to be higher in the PF cohort compared with those of controls."

    "abstract": "Regardless of the anatomic site of malignant bowel obstruction leading to the need for palliative intervention, decisions must consider the natural history of the disease, the availability and success of nonsurgical treatments, the individual patient's symptom severity, goals, preferences, quality, and expectancy of life. Therapy for symptoms must remain flexible and individualized because the specific needs of the patient will change as disease progresses. Because strangulation is uncommon, malignant bowel obstruction is usually not a surgical emergency. There is usually time to proceed with deliberate and thoughtful decisions on how best to meet the needs and expectations of the individual patient and family. Providers must be well versed in both surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic options, the natural history of disease, and be active and compassionate providers to foster meaningful ongoing dialogue focused on excellent care even after cure is no longer possible. The palliative triangle not only allows patient, family, and surgeon to effectively utilize the full continuum of care that can be delivered, but also it supports end-of-life decisions when continuity in care matters most. Due to social distancing requirements, the dynamics of communication between patient, family, and surgeon have changed. Zoom, Skype, and FaceTime have become tools in our communication armamentarium."

Most commonly it is a result of luminal occlusion that leads to ischaemia and eventually to perforation with resultant localised or diffuse peritonitis. Unusual causes have been documented including viral infections, parasites, tuberculosis and neoplasms. These conditions are important to recognise, as they may need additional specific management. This study endeavours to identify the incidence and type of unusual histopathology of appendicitis. A retrospective review of histopathological reports of appendix specimens obtained during appendectomies done between January 2012 and December 2014 in the three academic hospitals of Johannesburg - Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH), Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH), and Helen Joseph Hospital (HJH). All specimens were examined by pathologists of the National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS). A total of 2 408 histopathology results were obtained from the NHLS. 164 specimens were excluded because they were part of colonic resection for unrelated conditions. Of the 2 244 specimens included, 8.1% were normal, 52.7% showed acute appendicitis and 30.1% showed complicated appendicitis. Unusual pathology comprised 5.3% (119/2 244). The median age of all patients was 25.6 years (0-88yrs) and the gender distribution was 61.9% males and 38.1% females. The most common unusual causes were parasites (37%), mainly schistosomiasis (24.3%), followed by neoplasm (20%) and fibrous obliteration (14.2%). All appendectomy specimens must be submitted to the pathologist for histological diagnosis. It is important that the result be checked before the patient is discharged as further specific treatment may be indicated."

All general surgical emergency operations recorded prospectively on the operation theater database of Krishna Hospital and Medical Research Centre, Karad, between April 01, 2018, and March 31, 2019, were included in this study. The operations were categorized according to whether they commenced during the daytime (08:01-20:00 h), or nighttime (20:01-08:00 h). The type of procedure and grade of the participating surgical personnel were also recorded. In total, 1128 emergency operations were performed over the study period. The number of emergency procedures performed during the daytime and nighttime was 652 (57.8%) and 476 (42.2%), respectively. Laparotomies and complex vascular procedures collectively accounted for half of all the cases performed after midnight, whereas they represented only 30% of the combined daytime emergency workload. Thirty-two percent (n = 152) of all nighttime operations were supervised or performed by a consultant surgeon. When considering a surgical procedure, surgeons must bear in mind that cases that start after the routine hours may face an elevated risk of complications that warrants further evaluation and surgical start times are associated with risk-adjusted patient outcomes."

Most reported cases involve genital self-mutilation induced by underlying psychiatric disorder, especially schizophrenia. The self-mutilation of external genitals in psychiatric patients, also known as Klingsor syndrome, is a rare form of urotrauma. We present a case of partial penile amputation in a 46-year-old male with Klingsor syndrome admitted to the hospital 3 days after the incident. Urological examination revealed a subtotal cut of the penis, including the distal part of the mons pubis, dorsal and lateral parts of the penile skin, corpus cavernosum, and corpus spongiosum, as well as a partial bulbous urethra rupture. The penis remained suspended by only a thin ventral part of the penile skin. After macroscopic surgical replantation, the patient recovered well and could urinate without any symptoms of urethral stricture. The entire penis remained viable with minimal scarring at the surgical site, and penile erection could be achieved and maintained. The case demonstrates a rare instance of the successful proximal penile shaft amputation via macrosurgical techniques by an experienced urologic surgeon."

    "abstract": "Obstructed colon cancer is not an uncommon surgical emergency. Many other surgical diseases may overlap their presenting symptoms. This paper aims to report a colon cancer case with delayed diagnosis due to a long-standing para-umbilical hernia (PUH). 60-year-old female patient presented to our emergency department (ED) with an obstructed PUH. The patient underwent watchful conservative management many times before due to associated comorbidities. This history of recurrent intestinal obstruction and incomplete regain of regular bowel habits after every hospital admission raises the possibility for concealed pathology. Further investigations, including computed tomography (CT), revealed a suspicion of an obstructed malignant mass at the colon's splenic flexure accompanied with complete bowel obstruction. The patient and their family consulted for exploratory laparotomy and the possibility of stoma formation. The intra-operative finding was constant with a small ventral defect, and a dilated bowel loops up to a left colon transition zone. We achieved left hemicolectomy with a primary anastomosis after intra-operative bowel lavage. The postoperative period was uneventfully, and the patient was discharged home after seven days of admission. Follow up in the outpatient surgical clinic for three months revealed no recordable complications. The patient had transferred to the oncology center for the completion of adjuvant therapy. This case had a small PUH with recurrent obstruction. The delay in its management was due to the patient's comorbidities. However, the incomplete resolution of patient symptoms during watchful oversight increases the likelihood of another hidden pathology that required further investigation. We expanded CT indication in such patients to find the exact cause of patient symptoms, especially chronic constipation and incomplete recovery after every admission. While concurrent pathology is the norm in elective surgery and can be dealt with safely, in non-elective surgery, a thorough search about the patient's exact complaints is mandatory to decrease morbidity and mortality rates. In the same patient, both colon cancer and abdominal wall hernias can produce conflicting symptoms and delay diagnosis. However, with a high index of suspicion and correlation of patient symptoms, can be safely managed without morbidity."

    "abstract": "Tetanus is an acute onset neurological disease that is often lethal. It has a high disease burden in low and middle-income countries. Tetanus is caused by a toxin made by spores of the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which are found in soil, dust, and animal feces. The toxin impairs the motor neurons leading to muscle stiffness. However, with the development of a toxoid vaccine, the incidence has sharply declined and is now categorized as a vaccine-preventable disease. The treatment of tetanus is primarily supportive and focuses on managing the complications until the effects of toxins resolve. We report the case of a 67-year-old farmer who previously sustained a laceration injury approximately 45 days prior to presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain and rigidity. After a comprehensive evaluation to rule out other items in the differential diagnoses, he was diagnosed with tetanus based on clinical symptoms and ultimately required mechanical ventilation. The patient was then managed in the intensive care unit and later made an uneventful recovery. This case illustrates an uncommon presentation of tetanus and the latency of the infectious process. Often when patients present with atypical symptoms, it poses a diagnostic dilemma to the clinicians. Thus, it is very important to carefully elicit a history of contaminated injury. This case also highlights the importance of prophylactic vaccine in low and middle-income countries, which can reduce disease-related mortality and morbidity."

When he presented to hospital, computed tomography (CT) findings indicated perforated jejunoileal diverticulitis; however, in the operating room clockwise volvulization of the jejunum and ileum, secondarily inflamed jejunoileal diverticula, incomplete malrotation (right-sided duodenojejunal flexure), right retroperitoneal adhesions (Ladd's bands) and numerous other congenital adhesive bands were found. A modified Ladd's procedure and umbilical hernia repair were completed including detorsion, division of Ladd's bands with medialization of the cecum and lysis of other congenital adhesions without appendectomy. The patient recovered to baseline function by 3 weeks postoperatively. Acute midgut volvulus is a life-threatening surgical emergency that is exceptionally rare in the elderly. CT is relatively insensitive, so misdiagnosis is common. A high index of suspicion is required, especially in patients with a history of congenital gastrointestinal abnormalities. Prompt surgical exploration for correction and prevention is crucial."

Typhiodal salmonella includes S. enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi that cause the systemic disease but are restricted to human infections, while NTS consists mainly of other serovars that predominantly cause self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans. Localisation of foci with persisting infection occurs due to dissemination of the bacteria throughout the body and can cause a variety of rare clinical syndromes at aberrant sites. Fournier's gangrene, a rapidly progressive, often fatal, necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia and perineum due to Salmonella typhimurium, is a rare manifestation and has never been reported. A 22-year-old male, apparently healthy patient with no relevant past medical history, was presented to surgical emergency with chief complaints of swelling of bilateral scrotal area. Infective etiology was considered and a diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene was made. Pure growth of Salmonella typhimurium was obtained after repeated subculture and was identified biochemically and on serotyping, as Salmonella enterica, Serotype typhimurium using specific antisera. In our case report, we describe a case of Fournier's gangrene due to Salmonella Typhimurium in an otherwise healthy male to highlight the unusual presentation of Non typhoidal salmonellae at an aberrant site. We also emphasize the importance of using selective media like Selenite F broth for isolation of Salmonella typhimurium from a pus sample."

    "abstract": "Insertion of an Intra gastric Balloon (IGB) has widely been used as a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of obesity. Gastric balloons are usually inserted for a period of six months only. They have a high safety profile and one of their rare, reported, serious complications include gastric or esophageal perforation, which are usually early and require immediate operative management. We report a 26-year-old lady who presented to the ED with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen and five-year history of endoscopic placement of Intra-gastric Balloon. Emergent endoscopic removal of the balloon revealed a large pressure ulcer at gastric incisura with central necrosis. Laparoscopy confirmed gastric perforation along lesser curvature with extensive soilage of peritoneal cavity. Extensive irrigation and drainage and Graham omental patch repair were carried out laparoscopically, and the perforation sealed satisfactorily. She recovered well from surgery and within days she was tolerating a diet. Broad spectrum IV antibiotics were given for 10 days. Gastric perforation is a rare complication reported in 0.1% of patients undergoing IGB insertion. It can ensue as early as days after placement or late at weeks to months. In our review of literature, we found the maximum time frame in which a patient presented with an IGB induced gastric perforation was at 22 months. This makes our case unique as the patient was able to tolerate it for 5 years (60 months) before presenting to the emergency with this sinister complication. Very late Gastric perforations in patients with IGB placement are rare. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be arranged as soon as possible to remove the balloon and assess the stomach visualize the perforation followed by a laparoscopic approach to repair the defect if expertise is available."

    "abstract": "Duodenal perforation is a common surgical emergency and carries mortality ranging from 4% to 30% reported in Western countries, but there is a paucity of reports from India. We aimed to determine the factors which influence the surgical outcomes in patients with duodenal perforation. We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data from January 2010 to December 2018. A total of 55 patients were included in the study of which 69% (38) were males and 31% (17) were females (M : F = 4.5 : 2). The mean age was 52.3 years. The cause for duodenal perforation was duodenal ulcer (n = 25, 45.5%), followed by post-ERCP complications (n = 15, 27.3%), surgery (n = 11, 20%), and blunt trauma (n = 4, 7.2%) with perforations localized at D2 (n = 28, 51%) and at D1 (n = 27, 49%). Patients underwent primary repair with an additional diversion procedure (n = 28, 51%) and repair only in 18 (32.8%). There were 21 (38%) deaths. Patients with ERCP-associated duodenal perforation had longer hospital stay (P ≤ 0.001), ICU stay (P=0.049), duration of drainage (P ≤ 0.001), and higher leak rate (P=0.001) and re-exploration rate (P=0.037). A high mortality rate was seen in patients with preoperative organ failure (n  = 18, 78% versus 9.4%, P=0.001), postoperative leak (n = 7, 64% versus 32%, P=0.05), and longer duration from onset of symptoms to surgery (≥4 days) (P=0.045). Perforation of the duodenum is associated with high morbidity and mortality regardless of its cause and is higher in those who have a longer interval to surgery, preoperative organ failure, and a postoperative leak."

    "abstract": "Low- and middle-income countries like Uganda face a severe shortage of pediatric surgeons. Most children with a surgical emergency are treated by nonspecialist rural providers. We describe the design and implementation of a locally driven, pilot pediatric emergency surgical care course to strengthen skills of these providers. This is the first description of such a course in the current literature. The course was delivered three times from 2018 to 2019. Modules include perioperative management, neonatal emergencies, intestinal emergencies, and trauma. A baseline needs assessment survey was administered. Participants in the second and third courses also took pre and postcourse knowledge-based tests. Forty-five providers representing multiple cadres participated. Participants most commonly perform hernia/hydrocele repair (17% adjusted rating) in their current practice and are least comfortable managing cleft lip and palate (mean Likert score 1.4 ± 0.9). Equipment shortage was identified as the most significant challenge to delivering pediatric surgical care (24%). Scores on the knowledge tests improved significantly from pre- (55.4% ± 22.4%) to postcourse (71.9% ± 14.0%, p < 0.0001). Nonspecialist clinicians are essential to the pediatric surgical workforce in LMICs. Short, targeted training courses can increase provider knowledge about the management of surgical emergencies. The course has spurred local surgical outreach initiatives. Further implementation studies are needed to evaluate the impact of the training. V."

To analyze a series of cases of advanced PD in which a clinical or surgical emergency played a trigger role in the irreversible progression of landmarks of the course of the disease. Data were collected during a 13-month observational period of a cohort of 230 PD patients, in 751 medical appointments. We included a total of 13 (5.65% of the total number) patients with advanced PD defined by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage ≥3 who presented with various clinical and surgical complications which, with the contribution of drug interventions, led to significant worsening of patients' overall clinical condition. Hip fractures and infections were the most common complications identified. As part of this scenario, most patients presented with delirium, often requiring treatment with dopamine receptor blocking agents and/or had dopaminergic treatment withdrawn. Upon reassessment after 3 months, all patients remained bed or wheel chair bound (H&Y 5) and presented significant worsening of their UPDRS part III score of at least 10 points (mean 51.5 ± 3.3; paired t-test two-tailed p < 0.0001 compared to baseline). The mean dose of levodopa at baseline was 907.7 ± 149.8 mg (600-1200) and significantly higher (paired t-test two-tailed p < 0.0001) on follow-up, 1061.5 ± 175.8 mg (700-1300). Clinical and surgical emergencies are major determinants for a progression of PD to more advanced stages."

The purpose of the present scientific report is to describe the surgical retrieval of IOFB secondary to ballistic wound in a wild Rhesus macaque. A juvenile female wild Rhesus macaque was brought with the history of swollen and inflamed right eye for the past several days. Clinical examination revealed presence of partially healed wound over the dorsal eyelid. Radiographic examination revealed the presence of a metallic foreign body inside the right orbit. Inflamed and persistently closed eyelid prevented the further localization of the metallic foreign body. Lateral canthotomy was performed under general anesthesia. Following the failure to recover the metallic foreign body from the ocular adnexa, right eye vitrectomy was performed to retrieve the IOFB. The metallic foreign body was recovered from the posterior chamber of the right eye. Due to the poor prognosis of the already damaged eye, enucleation of the eye was performed which was followed by tarsorrhaphy. Further examination of the foreign body identified it as a 4.5 mm (.177 Calibre) air gun pellet. Post-operatively animal was treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. The animal recovered uneventfully. Intraocular foreign bodies secondary to gunshot wound should always be considered as a surgical emergency. Enucleation should be performed in cases having poor prognosis to avoid further complications especially in wild animals like Rhesus macaque."

The clinical features of COVID-19 are heterogeneous and subtle in many cases. They may easily be overlooked in the case of other acute diseases. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter gastrointestinal epithelial cells. However, these complaints can also be caused by a COVID-19-independent concomitant abdominal pathology. Therefore, patients with acute abdominal pain and fever need to be assessed very thoroughly. Based on a clinical case, we present our approach of managing emergency patients with acute abdomen and concomitant suspicion of -COVID-19."

According to first adult studies association of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with COVID 19 infection was as high as 79% (1).But later study showed lower association around 18% (2).As the pandemic of COVID 19 is going on, different clinical presentation of disease especially in children are well appeared. In addition atypical presentations may confuse and mislead physician to do different diagnostic procedures and interventions. We report a 6 years and half old boy with diarrhea, abdominal pain with first diagnosis acute abdomen due to acute appendicitis. At last diagnosis of pneumatosis intestinalis due to enterocolitis was confirmed. A 6 years and half old boy with severe abdominal pain admitted in emergency ward. He had history of fever, nine days of diarrhea and recurrent vomiting. The abdominal pain was severe with moderate tenderness in right lower quadrant. He admitted in pediatric surgery ward after surgical consultation for rolling out acute appendicitis. The results of first lab studies were shown leucopenia, lymphopenia and COVID 19 PCR was positive. During admission the cough has increased and abdominal distention has evolved. Vomiting was intractable and feeding was impossible. Pneumatosis intestinalis in ascending colon and dilatation in colon caliber were detected abdominal. Miliary like pattern in lung has reported in chest CT. Stool exam results revealed loss of protein in high amount in spite of normal pancreatic and enterocyte function. The calprotectin was high and implied high inflammation in large intestine. With all above data necrotizing enterocolitis management was started. After 14 days patients had good appetite and feeding slowly introduced. All symptoms resolved with exception of cough. Albumin and other electrolytes remained stable. The patient discharged without morbidity. COVID 19 infection has many different and mysterious presentations. GI manifestations are among important, common presentations. The acute abdomen like presentation with different complications like pneumatosis intestinalis, protein losing enteropathy are not common but knowledge about these presentations assist physician to be aware and make decision accurately."

    "abstract": "Introduction Acute calculus cholecystitis is one of the most common causes of acute abdominal pain in patients presenting to the emergency department, representing a third of all surgical emergency hospital admissions. Laparoscopic surgery is typically performed within 24 to 48 hours of hospital admission. Due to similarities in presentation, it is often difficult to differentiate between biliary colic and acute cholecystitis. Currently, it is not clear how the clinical and radiological diagnosis of acute calculus cholecystitis correlates with the histopathological diagnosis.  Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 350 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in our community hospital for acute calculus cholecystitis. The aim was to compare pre-operative radiological diagnoses of acute calculous cholecystitis to post-operative histopathological diagnosis. Four radiographic modalities were used for diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis: ultrasound, computerized tomography, MRI, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan). A correlation was found between both the clinical pain of biliary origin and radiological diagnosis with subsequent histopathological diagnosis after laparoscopic surgery. Results When the four commonly used imaging modalities were compared, HIDA scan had the highest sensitivity and ultrasound had the highest specificity in successfully diagnosing acute calculus cholecystitis that had been confirmed with histopathological analysis. Conclusion No absolute correlation was found between any of the imaging modalities when compared to the pathological diagnosis. The ultrasound had maximum specificity, while the HIDA scan had maximum sensitivity when radiological imaging was compared to histopathology."

    "abstract": "Interfacility transfers may reflect a time delay of definitive surgical care, but few studies have examined the prevalence of interfacility transfers in the urban low- and middle-income (LMIC) setting. The aim of this study was to determine the number of interfacility transfers required for surgical and obstetric conditions in an urban MIC setting to better understand access to definitive surgical care among LMIC patients. A retrospective analysis of public interfacility transfer records was conducted from April 2015 to April 2016 in Cali, Colombia. Data were obtained from the single municipal ambulance agency providing publicly funded ambulance transfers in the city. Interfacility transfers were defined as any patient transfer between two healthcare facilities. We identified the number of transfers for patients with surgical conditions and categorized transfers based on patient ICD-9-CM codes. We compared surgical transfers from public vs. private healthcare facilities by condition type (surgical, obstetric, nonsurgical), transferring physician specialty, and transfer acuity (code blue, emergent, urgent and nonurgent) using logistic regression. 31,659 patient transports occurred over the 13-month study period. 22250 (70.2%) of all transfers were interfacility transfers and 7777 (35%) of transfers were for patients with surgical conditions with an additional 2,244 (10.3%) for obstetric conditions. 49% (8660/17675) of interfacility transfers from public hospitals were for surgical and obstetric conditions vs 32% (1466/4580) for private facilities (P<0.001). The most common surgical conditions requiring interfacility transfer were fractures (1,227, 5.4%), appendicitis (913, 4.1%), wounds (871, 3.9%), abdominal pain (818, 3.6%), trauma (652, 2.9%), and acute abdomen (271, 1.2%). Surgical and obstetric conditions account for nearly half of all urban interfacility ambulance transfers. The most common reasons for transfer are basic surgical conditions with public healthcare facilities transferring a greater proportion of patient with surgical conditions than private facilities. Timely access to an initial healthcare facility may not be a reliable surrogate of definitive surgical care given the substantial need for interfacility transfers."

The preoperative diagnosis was panperitonitis due to gastrointestinal perforation. Although his parents had not suffered from vEDS, he had been diagnosed with the disease at 25 years of age because of his history of arterial dissection.

    "abstract": "Current guidelines do not specify timing for management of acute spinal cord injury (aSCI) due to lack of high-quality evidence supporting specific intervals for intervention. Randomized prospective trials may be unethical. Nonetheless, physicians have been sued for delays in diagnosis and intervention. The authors reviewed both the medical literature supporting the guidelines and the legal cases reported in the Westlaw and Lexis Advance databases from 1972 to 2018 resulting in awards or settlements, to identify whether surgeons are vulnerable to litigation despite the existence of guidelines not mandating specific timing of care. Timing of intervention was related to claims in 59 (36%) of 163 cases involving SCI. All 22 trauma cases identified cited timing of intervention, sometimes related to delayed diagnosis, as a reason for the lawsuit. The mean award of 10 cases in which the plaintiffs' awards were disclosed was $4,294,384. In the majority of cases, award amounts were not disclosed. Because conduct of a prospective, randomized trial to investigate surgical timing of intervention for aSCI may not be achievable, evidence-based guidelines will be unlikely to mandate specific timing. Nonetheless, surgeons who unreasonably delay intervention for aSCI may be at risk for litigation due to treatment delay. This is increasingly likely in an environment where \"complete\" SCI is difficult to verify. SCI may at some point be recognized as a surgical emergency, as brain injury generally is, despite a lack of prospective randomized trials supporting this implementation, challenging the feasibility of the US trauma infrastructure to provide care for these patients."

Button battery ingestion is an established surgical emergency, requiring immediate removal. Timing of removal for other foreign bodies remains controversial. We hypothesize that there is no difference in complication rate or successful removal of esophageal foreign bodies that wait until the following morning for removal. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review for cases involving esophageal foreign body removal by pediatric surgery or pediatric gastroenterology from November 2015 to November 2019 was performed. Patients were divided into two groups based on ED arrival-daytime (05:00-16:59); nighttime (17:00-04:59). Imaging confirmed an esophageal foreign body. Data collected included basic demographics, time of presentation, time of procedure, symptoms, location of the foreign body, and complications within 30 days. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: After excluding button batteries, 273 children underwent esophageal foreign body removal. Two-thirds presented at night. A significant difference was identified in the median time from ED to the operating room when comparing daytime (194.8 minutes; interquartile range [IQR]: 108.5-347) versus nighttime groups (643 minutes; IQR: 471.5-745; P < .001). Nine children had a complication or readmission within 30 days of their procedure and 25 patients had migration of their foreign body into the stomach, both with no significant difference (P = .94; P = .98, respectively). Conclusion: We found that waiting until the following morning had minimal impact on complications or success rate when removing esophageal foreign bodies. By waiting, institutions with limited personnel can keep resources and staff available for more pressing emergencies."

This was a retrospective review of all children presenting with benign ovarian tumors between January 2014 and January 2019. A standardized dataset was used to compare between both sides. Eighty-nine patients were included (54 English and 35 Egyptians). Median age at diagnosis in England was 13 years (2-16y), while in Egypt it was 7 years (9m-16y) with P =0.001. Mature teratomas or dermoid cysts were the most common findings in England and Egypt; 75.9% and 82.8% of cases, respectively. The presentation with an acute abdomen represented 27.8% of English and 28.6% of Egyptian patients. Incidentally diagnosed lesions constituted 15% of English patients, whereas none of the Egyptian cases were discovered incidentally. There were variations in diagnostic imaging; England: Ultrasound (USS) (54), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (37), and computed tomography (CT) (only one)-Egypt: USS (35), CT (17), and MRI (only one). Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) was performed in 15% of English and 23% of Egyptian patients (P = 0.334). Ovarian-sparing surgery (OSS) was performed in: England 35%, Egypt 37%; P = 0.851. OSS was performed using MIS in 87.5% (7/8) of English patients and 100% (8/8) of Egyptians. Patients presented as emergencies generally had open oophorectomies: England; 86.7% open and 80% oophorectomy-Egypt; 100% open and 90% oophorectomy. Recurrences or metachronous disease occurred in 5.6% of English and 5.7% of Egyptian patients. There were no significant differences regarding surgical management, tumor pathology, and recurrence or metachronous disease. However, age, incidental diagnosis, and imaging modalities showed notable differences. MIS was correlated with ovarian preservation, whereas emergency surgery generally resulted in open oophorectomy."

    "title": "Primary omental torsion with massive necrosis A case of uncommon surgical emergency.",
    "abstract": "A 61-year-old male patient presented to our hospital's emergency department with a history of worsening abdominal pain. The symptoms began as epigastric pain and later localized to the right lower quadrant. On physical examination, there was rebound tenderness mainly in the right lower quadrant and in the right upper quadrant. The laboratory results showed leukocytosis. Abdominopelvic computed tomography scan revealed that a definite twisting on the long axis with three complete counter-clockwise turns was observed in the vascular structures of greater omentum. At operation, the greater omentum was found to be twisted and gangrenous. The infarcted omentum was ligated at the pedicle and excised. Primary torsion of the omentum is one of the uncommon causes of acute abdominal pain. Although rarely diagnosed, the entity is important to the surgeon because it mimics the common causes of the acute surgical abdomen. Omental torsion usually occurs on the right side. Abdominal pain starts suddenly after a heavy meal or hard exercise, and is not accompanied with nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Abdominal computed tomography may show peculiar features suggestive of omental torsion. Treatment consists of ligation and resection of the involved portion of the omentum and recovery is usually rapid, uneventful and complete. Primary omental torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. The surgeon must remain aware of the disease and search for it if, at laparotomy, other adequate cause is not found to explain the symptoms, especially if free sero-sanguineous fluid is found in the peritoneal cavity. KEY WORDS: Acute abdomen, Greater omentum, Omental torsion, Omental infarction, Omental necrosis. L’infarto del fegato è una rara causa di addome acuto e viene diagnosticato solo con la chirurgia esplorativa. Un paziente maschio di 61 anni si è presentato al pronto soccorso del nostro ospedale con una storia di peggioramento del dolore addominale. I sintomi sono iniziati come dolore epigastrico e successivamente localizzati nel quadrante inferiore destro. All’esame fisico, vi era una tenerezza di rimbalzo principalmente nel quadrante inferiore destro e nel quadrante superiore destro. I risultati di laboratorio hanno mostrato leucocitosi. La tomografia computerizzata addominopelvica ha rivelato che nelle strutture vascolari di maggiore omento è stata osservata una torsione definita sull’asse lungo con tre giri completi in senso antiorario. All’operazione, il maggiore omento è risultato essere contorto e cancrenoso. L’omento infarto fu legato al peduncolo e fu rimosso. La torsione primaria dell’omento è una delle cause non comuni di dolore addominale acuto. Sebbene diagnosticata raramente, l’entità è importante per il chirurgo perché imita le cause comuni dell’addome chirurgico acuto. La torsione ossea di solito si verifica sul lato destro. Il dolore addominale inizia improvvisamente dopo un pasto pesante o un intenso esercizio fisico e non è accompagnato da nausea, vomito e anoressia. La tomografia computerizzata addominale può mostrare caratteristiche peculiari che suggeriscono la torsione omentale. Il trattamento consiste nella legatura e nella resezione della parte interessata dell’omento e il recupero è generalmente rapido, senza incidenti e completo. La torsione omentale primaria dovrebbe essere presa in considerazione nella diagnosi differenziale dell’addome acuto. Il chirurgo deve rimanere a conoscenza della malattia e cercarla se, alla laparotomia, non viene trovata un’altra causa adeguata per spiegare i sintomi, specialmente se nella cavità peritoneale si trova un liquido siero-sanguigno libero."

    "abstract": "Introduction  The ongoing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted health services throughout the world. It has brought in several new challenges to deal with surgical emergencies. Herein, we report two suspected cases of COVID-19 that were operated during this \"lockdown\" period and highlight the protocols we followed and lessons we learned from this situation. Result  Two patients from \"red zones\" for COVID-19 pandemic presented with acute abdomen, one a 64-year male, who presented with perforation peritonitis and another, a 57-year male with acute intestinal obstruction due to sigmoid volvulus. They also had associated COVID-19 symptoms. COVID-19 test could not be done at the time of their presentation to the hospital. Patients underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy assuming them to be positive for the infection. Surgical team was donned with full coverall personal protective equipment. Sudden and uncontrolled egression intraperitoneal free gas was avoided, Echelon flex 60 staplers were used to resect the volvulus without allowing the gas from the volvulus to escape; mesocolon was divided using vascular reload of the stapler, no electrosurgical devices were used to avoid the aerosolization of viral particles. Colostomy was done in both the patients. Both the patients turned out to be negative for COVID-19 subsequently and discharged from hospital in stable condition. Conclusion  Surgeons need to adapt to safely execute emergency surgical procedures during this period of COVID-19 pandemic. Preparedness is of paramount importance. Full precautionary measures should be taken when dealing with any suspected case."

A total of 350 consecutive patients with perforation peritonitis were studied in terms of age, sex, seasonal variation, biochemical parameters, clinical presentation, radiological and intraoperative findings, surgical intervention, and postoperative outcome. Results: The most common cause of perforation peritonitis in our study was a duodenal ulcer (~50%) followed by typhoid (20%), traumatic (14.5%), appendicular (7.4%), and tubercular (3.1%) cases. Males were three times more commonly affected than females. Peak incidence was noted in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life. Peptic ulcer perforations were common in autumn and winter and typhoid perforations were common during the summer and rainy seasons. Conclusion: Spectrum of perforation peritonitis cases in this part of world is different from developed western countries. It is different in respect of younger age at presentation, site of perforation, and etiological factors. Infective pathology makes up to a quarter of total cases in the developing world. The developing world has more perforation peritonitis cases involving the upper gastrointestinal tract, while the western world has a predominance of lower gastrointestinal tract perforations."

    "title": "'POLIDON' Approach-A Novel Solution for the ENT & Skull Base Surgeons in COVID-19 era.",
    "abstract": "Health care providers (HCP) of ENT and Skull base surgery are highly vulnerable and mostly infected by novel coronavirus as they have to examine and perform procedures directly in oral cavity, oropharynx, nose, nasopharynx, where coronavirus remains in plenty. ENT & Skull base surgeons need to do several aerosol generating procedures (AGP). Most of the endoscopic and microscopic ENT & skull base surgery are AGP; like-mastoid surgery, sinus surgery, surgery of pituitary, tympanomastoid paraganglioma, temporal bone malignancy, tracheostomy etc. All of we know, COVID negative by RT-PCR test is not always COVID negative. In COVID-19 pandemic-routine, even cancer surgeries are avoided or postponed for the sake of safety of HCPs. Moreover, in case of surgical emergency there's no way to refuse a patient for not having a report of COVID test. We thought about neutralizing or destroying the novel coronavirus from it's route of entry zone, as well as preventing aerosol to be transmitted in the air of OT. We designed a novel approach, i.e. 'POLIDON' (POLIDON = Polythene + Povidone Iodine), which can be the solution for these patients as well as surgeons or HCPs of above mentioned specialties. Use of Povidone Iodine as mouthwash and nasal spray or irrigation for both patient and HCPs prior to surgery is proposed. Then, use of simple polythene as barrier drape of patient or operative area for prevention of spread of aerosol in OT during surgery is the other component. With the POLIDON' approach-all these ENT & skull base surgeries can be done with more safety and confidence."

    "abstract": "We report a case of spontaneous bladder rupture due to bladder carcinoma. A 52-year-old female presented in septic shock, and computed tomography revealed free air in the subphrenic space and a mass in the middle of the pelvis. The exploratory laparotomy helped to confirm a definitive diagnosis: bladder rupture due to bladder carcinoma. She underwent a radical cystectomy and survived. Surgical intervention is recommended to manage carcinomatous bladder rupture. Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential to optimize the patient's outcomes. The possibility of spontaneous bladder rupture should not be overlooked as a differential diagnosis in cases of the acute abdomen."

    "abstract": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a heterogeneous group of congenital cardiac malformations which associates hypoplastic/aplastic left ventricle, mitral and aortic valve, hypoplastic/atresia and severe aortic artery coarctation, and represents a medical-surgical emergency. We present a case of a newborn hospitalised in three clinics (two clinics from Timisoara and one from Vienna), and operated for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, without aortic coarctation, using a mixed technique cardiovascular repair surgery. The initial therapeutic conduct included maintaining the permeability of the arterial canal with prostaglandin E1. At the Vienna General Hospital, at the age of 17 days, bilateral banding of the pulmonary artery was performed and, at the age of 20 days, during the cardiac catheterisation, the Rashkind procedure (balloon atrial septostomy) was performed, with two stents being implanted in the arterial canal. Postoperative complications were postcardiotomy syndrome, pneumonia with Enterococcus faecalis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, sepsis with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulopathy, mixed anaemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient died 1 month after the intervention due to cardiorespiratory arrest, bilateral congestive heart failure, left heart hypoplasia with shunt through the arterial canal and pulmonary artery banding, multiorgan failure, and severe secondary haemorrhagic disease. In conclusion, the initial cardiac surgical reconstruction consisted of a mixed technique, and anticoagulant medical treatment with heparin, antibiotics (bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis to be performed throughout life); postintervention hypoxic and infectious complications resulted in multiorgan failure and death."

Non-operative treatment (hydrostatic reduction) of intussusception is increasingly being practiced in developing countries. this was a review of our experience in the hydrostatic reduction of intussusception in children at a teaching hospital in Enugu, Nigeria. This study covered an 18-months period, October 2017 to March 2019. Patients on presentation were resuscitated, appropriate investigations done and prepared for surgery before the hydrostatic reduction (using normal saline) was carried out. Patients with features of peritonitis and marked abdominal distension were excluded from hydrostatic reduction. twenty patients who had 21 episodes of intussusception were analyzed. One patient had a recurrence that necessitated repeat hydrostatic reduction. Eighty percent of the patients were male. The mean and peak age of the patients was 8 months and 6 months respectively. Significant number of the patients presented after 48 hours of onset of their symptoms. Abdominal pain was the predominant presenting symptom. Twenty percent and fifteen percent of the patients had a history of preceding gastrointestinal and respiratory infections preceding the intussusception respectively. Ileocolic intussusception was the most common type and the most distal end of the intussusception was at the transverse colon. Hydrostatic reduction was successful in 13 patients (65%). hydrostatic reduction is a simple and effective method of treatment of intussusception. However, early presentation and proper patient selection is necessary for optimal outcome."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints that lead to an emergency department visit. Depending on the interpretation of the definition, 20-40 % of these patients present with an acute abdomen. This term summarizes a variety of diseases that often occur in the abdominal cavity, mostly acute, and can be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The challenge for the physician is to differentiate a whole range of vital diseases from less urgent causes of complaints. Extra-abdominal differential diagnoses should also be considered. Initial diagnosis often requires a great deal of clinical experience.The targeted medical history and clinical assessment together with the selection of the appropriate technical investigation play a central role. The goal must be to move from symptom-based to causal therapy as quickly as possible and to clarify whether a patient needs to be referred to an emergency operation or whether there is time for further differential diagnostic measures. The prognosis of the acute abdomen often depends on the time latency until the definitive therapy is initiated. Rapid and determined action by the experienced initial examiner are important prerequisites for a favorable course of the disease process."

Laboratory analyses revealed mild leukocytosis and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed unspecific findings, including segmental jejunal wall thickening without obstruction and ascites. Regarding the clinical findings, similar to an acute abdomen with no clear cause, the patient underwent an emergency laparoscopy that excluded other pathological features. The symptoms recurred 1 month after and the CT scan revealed the same pattern. Perindopril was stopped and the patient improved, concluding that ACE inhibitor-induced visceral angioedema was responsible for this clinical presentation."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a common clinical scenario encountered in clinical practice. Perforations related to foreign bodies are rare (<1%) but can present as a serious element in Emergency surgery. The most common site of perforations are angulated areas like ileocecal valve, sigmoid colon and duodeno-jejunal flexure and small bowel. We describe a rare case of duodenal perforation related to foreign body ingestion which has rarely been reported in the literature. This case report describes the presentation and management of a 65 year old male who presented with septic shock without symptoms and signs of an acute abdomen. Imaging revealed a sealed foreign body perforation in the first part of duodenum with a localized abscess. The abscess cavity was drained and the foreign body (fish bone) was removed laparoscopically. Foreign body perforations were often missed in view of its atypical and latent presentation with the history of foreign body ingestion is rare. Early multiplanar reformatting CT images help in identifying the cause and also to locate the foreign body in most of the patients, thus making it an important tool for preoperative diagnosis which assists in surgical planning. Though the majority of patients will require an exploratory laparotomy, minimally invasive procedures can be attempted in stable patients similar to this case."

This study aimed at characterizing immune responses towards a large variety of gut commensals and pathogens, and pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands, and investigating the course of systemic inflammation in a prospective cohort of acute appendicitis patients. PBMC responses of 23 patients of the cohort and 23 healthy controls were characterized more than 8 months post-surgery. Serum cytokine levels were measured in 23 patients at the time of appendicitis and after one month. CRP, WBC and percentage of neutrophils were analyzed in the total cohort of 325 patients. No differences in PBMC responses were found between patients and controls. Stronger IL-10 responses were found following complicated appendicitis. A trend towards lower IL-8 responses was shown following gangrenous appendicitis. Serum IL-10 and IL-6 were significantly elevated at presentation, and IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels were higher in complicated appendicitis. Routine biomarkers could predict severity of appendicitis with high specificities, but low sensitivities. Cytokine responses in patients following acute appendicitis did not differ from healthy controls. Higher serum cytokine levels were found in acute complicated and gangrenous cases. Further research into discriminative biomarkers is warranted."

    "title": "Role of imaging in visceral vascular emergencies.",
    "abstract": "Differential diagnosis in non-traumatic acute abdomen is broad and unrelated diseases may simulate each other from a clinical perspective. Despite the fact that they are not as common, acute abdominal pain due to diseases related to visceral vessels may be life-threating if not detected and treated promptly. Thrombosis, dissection, and aneurysm in the abdominal visceral arteries or thrombosis in visceral veins may cause acute abdominal pain. Imaging with appropriate protocoling plays a fundamental role in both early diagnosis and determination of the treatment approach in these cases where early treatment can be life-saving. Computed tomography (CT) appears to be the most effective modality for the diagnosis as it provides high detail images in a very short time. Patient cooperation is also a less concern as compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As the imaging findings may sometimes be really subtle, diagnosis may be difficult especially to inexperienced imagers. Correct protocoling is also very critical to detect arterial abnormalities as visceral arterial abnormalities may not be detectable in portal phase only abdominal CT scans. In this article, we aimed to increase awareness among imaging specialists to these not very common causes of acute abdomen."

It presents as acute abdomen with features of intestinal obstruction. As it is a life-threatening condition, it should be kept as a differential for small bowel obstruction despite its rarity. Therefore, we report this case. A 60-year-old gentleman presented to our emergency department with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension and obstipation. Exploratory laparotomy was done which revealed ileal volvulus with no predisposing factors. Derotation of the segment was done. The postoperative period was uneventful and on follow up after a month, he had a satisfying recovery. Though primary ileal volvulus is a rare diagnosis, it should be kept in mind in any patient with small bowel obstruction with pain out of proportion and resistant to opioid management. Early diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention is the key to prevent bowel necrosis and associated morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It affects ~5-10% of women in their reproductive years. When it affects the intestine, it tends to be confused clinically with a wide variety of affections, which is why it has sometimes been called \"the great simulator\". A review of the literature shows that intestinal localization is rare and that obstruction secondary to this cause is even more unusual, with preoperative diagnosis being a challenge for surgeons. With the purpose of highlighting clinical and diagnostic imaging characteristics that help the preoperative suspicion of this entity, so rare in routine practice, we present two cases of women who underwent emergency surgery, without a previous diagnosis of endometriosis and with intestinal occlusion as the first manifestation of the disease. Treatment of intestinal occlusion by endometriosis consists of intestinal resection of the affected sector and primary anastomosis. Diagnosis of intestinal occlusion secondary to ileal endometriosis is based on a high index of suspicion and should be considered in women of childbearing age, without a history of disease and with a history of painful menstruation. La endometriosis se define como la presencia de tejido endometrial fuera de la cavidad uterina. Ocurre en aproximadamente 5 a 10% de las mujeres en edad fértil. Cuando afecta al intestino tiende a confundirse clínicamente con una gran variedad de afecciones por lo cual en algunas oportunidades se le ha llamado también \"la gran simuladora\". La revisión de la literatura muestra que la localización intestinal es poco frecuente y que la obstrucción secundaria a esta causa es aún más inusual, siendo el diagnóstico preoperatorio un desafío para los cirujanos. Con el propósito de resaltar características clínicas y de estudio por imágenes que ayuden a la sospecha preoperatoria de esta entidad tan infrecuente en la práctica habitual, se presentan dos casos de mujeres operadas de urgencia, sin diagnóstico previo de endometriosis y con oclusión intestinal como primera manifestación de la enfermedad. El tratamiento consiste en la resección intestinal del sector afectado y anastomosis primaria. El diagnóstico se basa en un alto índice de sospecha y debería ser considerado en mujeres en edad fértil, sin antecedentes patológicos y con historia de menstruaciones dolorosas."

    "abstract": "Wandering spleen is a rare condition in which the spleen is not anchored properly, due to congenital or acquired weakness of the splenic ligaments. This allows the spleen to migrate to any portion of the abdomen or pelvis, and can cause complications, including a splenic volvulus. The presentation of splenic volvulus of a wandering spleen ranges from mild pain to a surgical emergency. Splenic volvulus of a wandering spleen can cause significant morbidity and mortality, and often warrants surgical intervention. Cases of splenic volvulus of a wandering spleen have been reported in radiology and surgery literature, however there are no reports in emergency medicine literature in North America. A 37-year-old female presented to the ED with seven days of mild left upper quadrant abdominal pain that acutely worsened. She underwent laboratory studies which were near her baseline values. A CT abdomen pelvis demonstrated findings consistent with splenic volvulus of a wandering spleen. She was taken emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, detorsion of spleen, and splenectomy. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on hospital day six. Splenic volvulus of a wandering spleen is rare, though carries significant morbidity and mortality, especially if unrecognized. The presentation of splenic volvulus is variable, ranging from minor symptoms to an acute abdomen. Early diagnosis can prevent downstream complications, including development of vascular congestion, ischemia or infarcted intra-abdominal organs. Emergency Physicians should consider splenic volvulus in the differential diagnosis as an etiology of left-sided abdominal pain."

In rare circumstances, appendicitis can cause life-threatening complications e.g. septic shock. We present a case of septic shock caused by acute appendicitis complicated with abscess formation within the mesoappendix. A 42-year-old male was presented with migratory right lower abdominal pain, accompanied by septic shock and acute kidney failure. We performed emergency appendectomy and unexpectedly observed an abscess within the mesoappendix during surgery. The patient received antibiotic therapy perioperatively. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae subspecies were isolated from the intraoperative pus specimen, and Bifidobacterium was isolated from his preoperative blood culture. Histopathology revealed acute suppurative appendicitis. The patient recovered uneventful and was discharged 5 days after surgery. We believe that the septic shock was associated with the small abscess formation in the mesoappendix. Bacteria within the mesoappendix could enter the bloodstream through the mesoappendiceal vessel and then septic shock and kidney failure occurred sequentially. We assume that the abscess within the mesoappendix was caused by a tiny perforation from the mesoappendiceal side. The case of acute appendicitis complicated with abscess formation within mesoappendix explains one of the causes which may lead to septic shock."

To establish if complementary CT chest was performed as recommended, and if CT chest influenced surgical intervention decision. To assess detection rate of COVID-19 on CT and its correlation with RT-PCR swab results. To determine if COVID-19 changes is reliably detected within the lung bases which are usually imaged in standard abdominal CT. Patients with acute abdominal symptoms presenting to a single institution between 1st and 30th April 2020 who had abdominal CT and complementary CT chest were retrospectively extracted from Computerised Radiology Information System. CT COVID-19 changes were categorised according to British Society of Thoracic Radiology reporting guidance. Patient demographics (age and gender), RT-PCR swab results and management pathway (conservative or intervention) were recorded from electronic patient records. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate any significant association between variables. p values ≤0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Compliancy rate in performing complementary CT chest was 92.5% (148/160). Thirty-five patients (35/148,23.6%) underwent intervention during admission. There was no significant association (p = 0.9085) between acquisition of CT chest and management pathway (conservative vs intervention). CT chest had 57% sensitivity (CI 18.41% to 90.1%) and 100% specificity (CI 92% to 100%) in COVID-19 diagnosis. Three of ten patients who had classic COVID-19 changes on CT chest did not have corresponding changes in lung bases. Compliance with performing complementary CT chest in acute abdomen patients for COVID-19 screening was high and it did not influence subsequent surgical or interventional management."

Therefore, this is a report of mid-trimester triplet's ectopic pregnancy which presented with sudden repeated syncopal attacks and hemodynamic instability that necessitated emergency laparotomy to treat ruptured non-communicating rudimentary horn. The rarity of this clinical condition can lead to multiple challenges. When a diagnosis is confirmed, the intervention plans should be independently tailored based on the patient's age, obstetric history, fertility wishes, as well as, surgeon's experience. Moreover, most cases passed unnoticed till complications took place. Thus, early diagnosis of Mullerian anomalies preconceptionally or even during the initial antenatal visits is crucial step regarding the avoidance of such catastrophic maternal outcomes."

Retrospective studies show no association between reduced baseline renal function and IV contrast CT, but, to our knowledge, no data from randomised controlled trials exist. The INCARO (INtravenous Contrast computed tomography versus native computed tomography in patients with acute Abdomen and impaired Renal functiOn) trial is a multicentre, open-label, parallel group, superiority, individually randomised controlled trial comparing IV contrast-enhanced CT to native CT in patients requiring emergency abdominal or body CT with impaired renal function defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy (RRT) within 90 days from CT. Secondary outcomes are AKI measured by KDIGO (The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria within 72 hours from CT, organ dysfunction defined by mSOFA (modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) criteria after 48 hours from CT, alive and hospital-free days within 90 days after CT, and time from imaging to definitive treatment. All-cause mortality, need for RRT and renal transplant in long-term follow-up are also measured. The calculated sample size is 994 patients. Patient recruitment is estimated to take 3 years.

Although several cases of pneumoperitoneum with pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) have been reported, the characteristics of such cases remain unclear. The current study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of pneumoperitoneum cases with PI detected using computed tomography (CT).This descriptive study was conducted at a single center. In a total of 18,513 abdominal CT scans obtained between January 2010 and February 2017, extraluminal free air was detected in 254 examinations of 182 cases. The medical records and CT images of these 182 patients were retrospectively analyzed.Pneumoperitoneum with PI was detected through 23 examinations in 21 cases, and the average age of the patients was 80.1 years. The frequency was 0.12% in all abdominal CT examinations, but 24.7% in the 85 cases with extraluminal free air, excluding iatrogenic air. PI was classified as benign in 20 cases and as life-threatening in 1 case. The majority of cases with benign PI showed good general and local findings and little leukocytosis, while the case with life-threatening PI showed severe conditions. No evidence of bowel wall discontinuity, segmental bowel-wall thickening, perivisceral fat stranding, and abscesses were observed. Ascites were detected less frequently in the cases with PI than in the other pneumoperitoneum cases (P < .01). Pneumoperitoneum and PI occasionally recurred, and PI and/or extraluminal free air generally disappeared quickly.Pneumoperitoneum with PI is a relatively common condition in older patients, and the majority of cases are caused by benign PI. The characteristics of pneumoperitoneum cases with benign PI include well-maintained physical conditions, normal laboratory data, absence of CT findings indicative of peritonitis, and infrequent ascites. In pneumoperitoneum cases with PI, predicting whether the PI is benign or life-threatening is clinically very important, whereas the presence of extraluminal free air is considered to be insignificant."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy has been demonstrated as a significant risk factor of splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) formation and rupture. However, prompt diagnosis of SAA rupture in a pregnant patient showing acute abdomen has been practically challenging in light of its rarity and vague initial presentation. A 40-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 0) at 35 weeks' gestation presented to the emergency department with upper abdominal pain and nausea. Because of fetal dysfunction, emergency caesarian section was performed by a Pfannenstiel incision. Following delivery, 400 g of hemorrhage was removed from the upper abdominal cavity. Computed tomography showed a 37-mm SAA associated with copious adjacent fluid. Although selective angiography did not demonstrate active extravasation, interventional isolation of the SAA was not performed because of multiple surrounding arteries. Relaparotomy with an upper midline incision was then performed. Sudden cardiac arrest occurred upon opening the lesser sac to irrigate clots, and cardiac massage and proximal and distal clamping of the SAA were required. Eventually, splenectomy with excision of the SAA and pancreatic tail was successfully performed, but gauze packing of the open surgical wound was required because of severe coagulopathy. Following removal of the packs and closure of the abdomen 2 days after splenectomy, the patient and infant satisfactorily recovered without sequelae. Given continual awareness of abdominal vascular collapse during pregnancy, undelayed diagnosis and safer intervention might be achieved. Awareness at initial presentation and multidisciplinary efforts might be essential to achieve maternal and fetal survival in SAA rupture during pregnancy."

The medical records of 44 neonates who were operated on for intestinal volvulus from 1993 to 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into TMV and SV groups, and clinical features were compared. Operations were performed on 27 patients for TMV and 17 for SV. All cases of TMV were associated with intestinal malrotation, while those with SV were not. Gestational age, birth weight, and ratio of prematurity showed no differences between the groups. Preoperative diagnosis of TMV or SV was possible in 23 and 5 (85% and 29%) cases, respectively. Intestinal resection was required in 16/17 patients (94%) with SV, while it was required in 5/27 (19%) patients with TMV. When bowel resection was performed in TMV, all but one patient suffered from short bowel syndrome leading to two mortalities, while SV group showed good recovery. Diagnosis of SV before laparotomy can be difficult. Even though performing intestinal resection in SV neonates is highly likely, it shows a favorable outcome. TMV neonates are less likely to undergo intestinal resection; however, when bowel ischemia is present, significant morbidity can occur. Treatment study. Level IV."

    "title": "Cutaneous necrosis of the arteriovenous fistula puncture site in chronic hemodialysis: A historical complication or an ever-present threat? A series of 26 cases.",
    "abstract": "Cutaneous necrosis (CN) at the puncture site of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) is a rare but potentially fatal complication. The objective of our work was to establish the associated complications, vascular prognosis, and patient survival of CHD patients presenting cutaneous necrosis. This retrospective study (January 2016 to March 2020) was conducted in the Department of Vascular Surgery and the Department of Nephrology at the University Hospital Center Mohammed VI of Oujda, Morocco. Included were all CHD patients admitted for treatment of cutaneous necrosis at the puncture site of a native AVF. Data from 26 cases were collected. The mean age was 58.7 ± 16 years, 70.8% were female, and 25% had diabetic nephropathy; 42.3% of the AVFs were radiocephalic and 46.1% were brachiocephalic; 42.2% of patients presented active bleeding, of whom 91% required a blood transfusion; 80.8% of the AVFs were complicated by aneurysms. Fistulography showed stenosis in 42.3% of cases. Urgent surgical intervention was performed on all the patients. Fifty percent of patients required placement of a short-term hemodialysis catheter. Two patients had presented a recurrence. Death occurred in one case following a massive hemorrhagic shock. Cutaneous necrosis is a relatively common complication and requires early screening and immediate surgical intervention."

    "title": "Acute Mesenteric Ischemia.",
    "abstract": "Despite constant improvements in diagnostic as well as interventional and surgical techniques, acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) remains a life-threatening emergency with high mortality rates. The time to diagnosis of AMI is the most important predictor of patients' outcome; therefore, prompt diagnosis and intervention are essential to reduce mortality in patients with AMI. The present review was performed to analyze potential risk factors and to help find ways to improve the outcome of patients with AMI. Whereas AMI only applies to approximately 1% of all patients with an \"acute abdomen,\" its incidence is rising up to 10% in patients >70 years of age. The initial clinical stage of AMI is characterized by a sudden onset of strong abdominal pain followed by a painless interval. Depending on the extent of disease, the symptoms of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) and patients with a venous thrombosis can be very different from those of acute occlusive ischemia. Biphasic contrast-enhanced CT represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of arterial and venous occlusion. In case of a central occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery or signs of peritonitis, immediate surgery should be performed. If major bowel resection becomes necessary, critical residual intestinal length limits must be kept in mind. Endovascular techniques for arterial occlusion have taken on a much greater importance today. For stable patients with NOMI, interventional catheter angiography is recommended because it enables diagnosis and treatment with selective application of vasodilators. Depending on its degree, interventional treatment with a transhepatic catheter lysis should be considered for acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis. The prompt and targeted use of the appropriate diagnostics and interventions appears to be the only way to reduce the persistently high mortality rates for AMI."

    "title": "Is Mesenteric Ischemia In COVID-19 Patients A Surprise?",
    "abstract": "Aim. The disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus is known predominantly for its respiratory outcomes; a subset of critically ill patients demonstrates clinically remarkable hypercoagulability in which thrombotic events range from acute pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to extremity ischemia. Our observational study aimed to describe the incidence and characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes, of patients presenting and treated for mesenteric ischemia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods. Between March 13 and May 13, 2020, 60 patients operated for emergency reasons were analyzed, and it was noticed that 5 of the 6 COVID-positive patients were operated due to mesenteric ischemia. Results. Five of sixty patients (83.3%) applied to our emergency clinic with COVID-19 positive and acute abdomen. Two of them (40%) did not have any comorbidities. All of them (%100) were male. There were no complications and only 1 death (20%). Mean leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet levels were within the normal range, while the lymphocyte level was near the lower limit. C-Reactive Protein was above the limit in all patients. The mean levels of International Normalized Ratio, Platelet, and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time were above the limits. While D-dimer levels were close to the upper limit; fibrinogen levels were above the normal limit for each patient. Conclusion. The presence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-19 patients should be observed closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients. More clinical data are needed to examine the role of anticoagulation in COVID-19 treatment."

We aimed to examine the numbers and demographic data of patients who applied to the general surgery outpatient clinics and operated in this process. Our primary outcome is to reveal the response of general surgery patients to the Covid-19 pandemic.The first Covid-19 case in Turkey has appeared in March 11, 2020. Patients who were operated on due to a surgical emergency or trauma were evaluated separately. Patients in 3 periods were compared with each other. A total of 12728 patients were examined in general surgery outpatient clinics in 26 working days. It is seen that patients come to the outpatient clinic after the first time the Covid-19 patient is seen. All patients reduced hospitalization after the first death due to Covid-19. Women had reduced going to the hospital earlier than men. There was no change in the number of emergency surgeries. Rapid decrease was observed in the number of elective surgeries.It is not easy to control the entrance and exit of these busy hospitals. The remote diagnosis (mail, phone or video-call) and treatment methods that can be expected in the near future may be even closer with the Corona virus (Tab. 3, Fig. 4, Ref. 15).

    "abstract": "In settings with limited access to specialist services, differentiating septic arthritis-a surgical emergency-from non-infectious atraumatic arthropathy in paediatric patients is challenging, especially in a setting with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB). We aimed to investigate the aetiologies of swollen, painful joints in an urban setting in South Africa and determine how clinical and laboratory findings varied with diagnosis. A retrospective review of patients aged 12 or younger presenting to a paediatric hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, with atraumatic swollen, painful joints was conducted over a two year period from 2013 to 2015. Children were excluded if they did not have tissue culture or analysis conducted at our facility. Aetiology was classified as non-infectious, TB septic arthritis, or pyogenic arthritis from other bacterial causes. One hundred and four children met inclusion criteria. Arthritis was classified as non-infectious in 43 (41%), TB in 15 (14%), and pyogenic in 40 (38%), with six (6%) patients never receiving a final diagnosis. Mean C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell count (WCC) were all significantly higher in pyogenic infectious arthritis compared with TB and non-infectious arthritis. There were no significant differences in these parameters between non-infectious and TB arthritis. Using cut-point analysis, thresholds were identified predictive of the presence of pyogenic arthritis versus TB or non-infectious arthritis; these included the presence of fever, CRP > 50 mg/L, ESR > 65 mm/h and WCC > 12x109/L. The absence of all of these criteria resulted in a negative predictive value of 100% for pyogenic infection; the presence of three to four criteria resulted in a positive predictive value of 71%. Despite insignificant differences in their clinical presentation compared with non-infectious arthidities, 15% of children were diagnosed with tissue-confirmed TB infection. Predictive values of clinical criteria are reduced in our population due to elevated levels of inflammatory markers in all patients. Synovial biopsy to rule out TB is recommended in all patients in a high-burden setting given clinical similarity to non-infectious aetiologies."

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic rupture (DR) is an acquired diaphragmatic defect that can cause herniation of abdominal organs into the chest. It is usually a trauma-related lesion, but rarely it can occur spontaneously. Every DR with abdominal herniation should be considered a surgical emergency. A 61-year-old male patient, with previous exposure to asbestos, was diagnosed of Stage Ib malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). He underwent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (three cycle of cisplatin-pemetrexed combination) and a cytoreductive surgery with pleurectomy/decortication. Post-operative course was characterized by prolonged air-leakage (PAL). After three months, during a follow-up CT-scan, a spontaneous diaphragmatic rupture (SDR) with gastric herniation was detected and treated by a laparascopic diaphragmatic repair and suture. Spontaneous diaphragmatic rupture (SDR) is an extremely rare injury of the diaphragm (less than 1% of all DR). In this case, potential predisposing factors for SDR could be: presence of diaphragmatic \"locus minoris resistentiae\" due to thinning of the diaphragm and increase tissue fragility after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and diaphragmatic pleural stripping; increased thoraco-abdominal pressure gradient due to PAL and residual pleural space. Thus, we confirmed the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic approach. We highlight the multifactor etiopathology, the challenging diagnosis and the importance of a prompt treatment of SDR."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric cysts were first described in 1507 and since then remain as a rare intraabdominal pathology. The etiology of this kind of tumor is still unclear and the classification remains controversial. They are usually asymptomatic, but can also cause acute abdominal pain and sometimes need emergency surgical approach. Clinical history, physical exam and complementary tests do not always provide diagnosis, which in many cases is made after surgery. Surgical management with complete excision of the cyst is the gold standard treatment. Laparoscopy technique should be preferred whenever is possible. The knowledge of these rare tumors is important for considering the correct approach. The goals of this article is to describe a case report of mesenteric cyst presented with acute abdominal pain at the emergency and do a brief literature review about this entity."

The exact incidence is unknown largely due to underreporting. Acute malarial infection accounts for most of the spontaneous splenic rupture. Plasmodium vivax has been associated with the majority of them; however, on rare occasion, other Plasmodium infections have also resulted in splenic rupture. We report the case of a 74-year-old male who was diagnosed with severe malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) infection and developed an acute abdomen while on treatment due to spontaneous splenic rupture which necessitated emergency splenectomy."

    "abstract": "Colonic volvulus is defined as a torsion of a part of the colon causing large bowel obstruction by strangulation which may lead to ischemia and then necrosis. The synchronous occurrence of a sigmoid colon and transverse colon volvulus is exceptional. We describe a case of synchronous sigmoid and transverse volvulus in a patient with a qualitative systematic review of this condition. This is a 74-year-old patient with a history of chronic constipation, who consulted for bowel obstruction. Plain abdominal radiography showed diffuse gas distension of the colon with the absence of rectal gas. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and showed sigmoid colon volvulus associated with synchronous transverse colon volvulus without bowel necrosis. A left hemicolectomy with loop colostomy was performed. The restoration of bowel continuity was done 3 weeks. The post-operative course was uneventful. The occurrence of a simultaneous sigmoid and transverse colonic volvulus is an exceptional situation. Due to the rarity of this clinical entity, the literature concerning its description is sparse and the treatment options are poorly codified. There are no guidelines in the treatment and a tailored approach should be used for each patient. The dual location of strangulation makes this situation a major surgical emergency with a high risk of gangrene and septic shock. Colectomy with delayed anastomosis should be preferred in the treatment."

    "abstract": "Gluteal compartment syndrome is an uncommon condition and can be difficult to diagnose. It has been diagnosed after trauma, vascular injury, infection, surgical positioning, and prolonged immobilization from drug or alcohol intoxication. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and, in most cases, recognizing these symptoms and making a diagnosis early is critical to a complete recovery. A 53-year-old male who underwent left foot surgery had severe pain to his contralateral hip and posterior gluteal compartment radiating to the right lower extremity immediately postoperative. He was positioned supine with a \"bump\" placed under his right hip to externally rotate his operative leg during the surgery. Due to the patient's complex past medical history, a presumptive diagnosis of a herniated disc and/or compression of the sciatic nerve was made as a cause for the patient's pain. This resulted in a misdiagnosis period of 36 h until the patient was diagnosed with unilateral gluteal compartment syndrome. Performing a fasciotomy was decided against due to the increased risk of complications. The patient was treated with administration of IV fluids and closely monitored. On post-op day 6, the patient was discharged. At three months post-op, the patient was walking without a limp and he had no changes in his peripheral neurologic examination compared to his preoperative baseline. Gluteal compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency that must be considered postoperatively especially in obese patients with prolonged operation times who experience acute buttock pain. The use of positional bars or \"bumps\" in the gluteal area should be used with caution and raise awareness of this complication after orthopedic surgeries."

    "abstract": "There are fewer than 100 documented cases of transanal small bowel evisceration in the literature. We report two cases of this rare surgical emergency in an 84-year old man and a 79-year old woman. Both patients required urgent laparotomy, resection of ischaemic bowel and transabdominal resection of the rectal defect with colostomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Rare imaging and clinical photography are shared to highlight the extreme nature of this condition. We identified 38 relevant cases of reported bowel evisceration through our literature review. Most patients were elderly women with untreated rectal prolapse. Gynaecological comorbidity was another risk factor. The aetiological mechanism is suspected to stem from chronic ischaemic insult to the rectal wall, resulting in thinning and subsequent perforation. Surgical management may consist of primary suture repair of the rectal tear, or a Hartmann's procedure. Timely intervention is essential to minimise patient morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing fasciitis is a fulminant and potentially life-threatening infection of the skin and soft tissue. It is usually caused by a combination of different bacteria and is often due to assumed minor trauma. Clinically, only relatively insignificant skin changes are initially present, such as blistering or erythema. They are often accompanied by excessive pain. In the further course, the massive systemic reaction becomes predominant. The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is primarily clinical, which can be supported by laboratory parameters (LRINEC score) and computed tomography imaging. Decisive for the prognosis is the immediate initiation of surgical treatment by radical debridement. Additionally, the calculated administration of a combination of different antibiotics should be initiated. As part of the further complex intensive care treatment, a regular reevaluation of the wounds is carried out. Multiple débridements are always necessary until plastic surgery for defect coverage can be carried out."

Diagnosis of rudimentary horn pregnancy and its rupture in a woman with previous vaginal delivery is challenging. Although ultrasonography is an important diagnostic tool, it has low sensitivity in making diagnosis of ruptured rudimentary horn pregnancy. Therefore, clinicians should have high index of suspicion in such cases. We report a case of G3P2L2 at 15 weeks period of gestation referred to our centre as a case of intrauterine pregnancy with acute abdomen. She underwent emergency laparotomy and was found to have ruptured rudimentary horn intraoperatively. Excision of the ruptured rudimentary horn and ipsilateral salpingectomy was done and the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is any acute abdominal condition requiring a quick response. The incidence varies according to age and disease aetiology. The abdominal discomfort associated with extra-abdominal pathophysiology and thoracic conditions could mimic acute abdomen. In this case we report a rare case of a young patient with cardiac tamponade masquerading as acute abdomen. A 25-years-old African man presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain. An EKG was performed, which revealed sinus tachycardia, with electrical alternans and borderline reduced voltage. At the time of the admission to our unit, he had a clinical worsening and a CT scan of abdomen was performed, which demonstrated hepatomegaly, abundant pericardial effusion and thin right pleural effusion at the lung bases. An echocardiogram confirmed a circumferential pericardial effusion with initial collapse of the right ventricular free wall. It was decided to immediately transport the patient to the Cardiosurgery Unit of another hospital to undergo pericardiocentesis. Our experience with this case underlines the important point that patients with a large pericardial effusion may present with the clinical features of acute abdomen and peritonitis. Abdominal pain was the primary symptom that prompted this patient to seek medical attention. Acute abdomen is any acute abdominal condition requiring a rapid, often surgical, treatment. Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency. The differential diagnosis could be kept in mind by any emergency physician, surgeon and anaesthesiologist, because an incorrect diagnosis and therefore an incorrect treatment or a delay in pericardial evacuation can be life-threatening."

    "abstract": "Testicular torsion (TT) is a serious surgical emergency. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of TT are essential to improve the incidence of salvaged testes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the historical features, physical examination findings, laboratory tests, and ultrasound examinations in children with TT, as well as to identify the predictors of testicular salvage in children. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 136 males who presented with TT to our institution. Clinical findings, physical examinations, laboratory data, color Doppler ultrasound findings, operating results, and the results of follow-up were collected and analyzed. Patients with neonatal torsion, negative scrotal exploration, or testicular appendix torsion were excluded. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of testicular salvage. Receiver operator characteristics analyses were performed to determine the probability of a non-salvageable torsed testis based on time and degree of twisting. A total of 136 children with TT were identified. Patients were aged from 1 to 16 years, with a mean age of 9.7 years (median, 12; range, 1-16 years). The peak incidences of TT were found between ages of 12 and 14 years. Acute TT is significantly more common in the winter. Testicular salvage occurred in 49 (36%) cases. Of the 49 cases of testicular salvage, 5 patients developed subsequent testicular atrophy. Cutoff values of 13.5 h and 530 degrees of torsion would provide sensitivities of 96 and 61%, with specificity of 80 and 70%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that time to surgery and degree of testicular twist were correlated with the risk of a non-salvageable testis. Testicular salvage can be predicted by the duration of symptoms along with degree of twisting. Early scrotal exploration based on careful physical examination decreases the risk of misdiagnosis of spermatic cord torsion. A certain percentage of children with TT presenting with lower abdominal pain should have their testicles checked to make sure that they do not have torsion, especially those visitors in cold season."

    "abstract": "This paper reports an uncommon location and complication of a cystic lymphangioma. Few cases of infected colonic cystic lymphangioma were described in literature. Symptoms are non-specific and setting the diagnosis on radiological features remain challenging. Urgent open surgery is generally required for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. We describe a case of a young man who presented with an acute abdomen mimicking bile peritonitis, infected tumor of the colon or even a complicated hydatid disease of the liver, which is endemic in our country. CT-scan was compulsory to suspect the diagnosis of infected cystic lymphangioma but remained insufficient to rule out other more frequent diagnoses. The patient underwent an emergency open surgery consisting in a bowel resection, in whose case an infected cystic lymphangioma was barely suspected preoperatively but confirmed by the pathological examination of the specimen. No postoperative complications were noticed. Setting the diagnosis of an infected cystic lymphangioma of the colon is tough. Many differential diagnoses are more frequently suspected and radiological examinations can be helpful. However, an emergency surgery is mandatory in order to avoid septic shock and resect the lesion, sometimes at the cost of bowel resection. Laparoscopic or endoscopic treatments are feasible but are not the standard in emergency cases. Acute presentation of cystic lymphangioma of the colon is very scarce and can be life-threatening leading to urgent open surgery, although endoscopic or laparoscopic treatment remain feasible. Further studies are needed to select which technique is suitable for this disorder."

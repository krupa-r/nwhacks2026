    "abstract": "Point‑of‑care ultrasound (POCUS) has become an integral diagnostic tool in emergency medicine, providing rapid bedside imaging that supports timely clinical decision‑making in acutely ill and injured patients. This narrative review examines the diagnostic applications of POCUS in emergency department settings, with emphasis on trauma assessment, lung ultrasound, focused cardiac ultrasound, evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and early pregnancy complications. The literature review was conducted using PubMed to identify peer‑reviewed studies relevant to diagnostic POCUS use in emergency medicine. The reviewed evidence demonstrates that POCUS improves diagnostic accuracy, accelerates time to critical interventions, and enhances patient triage across a broad range of emergency presentations. Key diagnostic applications include the focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) and extended FAST examinations, evaluation of acute respiratory and cardiac conditions, rapid bedside identification of abdominal aortic aneurysm, and early detection of ectopic pregnancy. In summary, diagnostic POCUS represents a versatile, efficient, and clinically impactful modality that continues to enhance the delivery of emergency care."

    "title": "Recurrent ovarian torsion challenges in management and saving fertility: A rare case report.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive gynecologic emergency that may lead to irreversible ovarian damage. The condition becomes particularly critical in women with a solitary ovary, where timely diagnosis is essential to preserve fertility. A woman of reproductive age with a history of right oophorectomy due to torsion of a mature cystic teratoma presented to the emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Pelvic ultrasound revealed the absence of the right ovary and a complex left ovarian cyst measuring 6 × 6 cm, with signs of congestion. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a twisted, violaceous left ovary measuring approximately 10 × 10 cm with two full twists of the infundibulopelvic (IP) and utero-ovarian (OU) ligaments. Detorsion was performed. Current evidence challenges traditional practices of routine oophorectomy in torsion, as histologic studies report preserved viability in 43 % of ovaries despite ischemic appearance. This case reinforces the feasibility of detorsion in reproductive-aged women, particularly those with a solitary ovary, to safeguard fertility. The absence of contralateral ovarian tissue further underscores the need for conservative surgical approaches. This report emphasizes the critical role of early recognition and conservative surgical management in ovarian torsion, especially in patients with a solitary ovary. Timely detorsion can prevent irreversible fertility loss, even in grossly ischemic-appearing ovaries. Patient education about acute pelvic pain and clinician vigilance in high-risk populations are essential to mitigate diagnostic delays."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has emerged as a critical tool for diagnosing intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) in symptomatic first-trimester patients, particularly in emergency settings. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the test characteristics of PoCUS in diagnosing IUP. As a secondary objective, this study will also examine the accuracy of PoCUS in detecting fetal cardiac activity (FCA). This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA-DTA guidelines with the protocol registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024596206). We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar up to November 2024, identifying studies that compared PoCUS to reference standards for IUP diagnosis. Seven studies (n = 1716) were included in the meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate random-effects model was used to pool the diagnostic accuracy metrics. In this meta-analysis, PoCUS demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 86.3% (95% CI: 75.6%-92.8%, I2 = 89.8%) and a specificity of 98.2% (95% CI: 86.6%-99.8%, I2 = 72.6%) for the identification of IUP. Sensitivity analysis showed a significant decrease in heterogeneity for specificity (from 72.6% to 0%), along with a slight increase in sensitivity (88.5%). The pooled positive likelihood ratio was 39.01 (95% CI: 16.00-95.1), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.05-0.21). Moreover, subgroup analysis revealed higher sensitivity (92%) in studies using transvaginal ultrasound as the reference standard. In addition, PoCUS demonstrated high specificity (100%) and variable sensitivity (81-96%) for identifying FCA across three studies, but the limited number of studies prevented further meta-analysis. PoCUS is highly effective for diagnosing IUP in symptomatic first-trimester patients, allowing for the ruling out of ectopic pregnancy. However, when PoCUS is negative or indeterminate, follow-up strategies such as serial β-hCG, repeat ultrasound, or clinical reassessment remain essential to ensure diagnostic safety."

    "abstract": "Acute abdomen is a common indication to surgery in paediatric emergency departments. Appendicitis is the most frequent diagnosis, followed by bowel obstruction and female genital conditions. Some rare aetiologies may lead to challenges in surgical management. Aim of this study is to analyse the distribution of rare causes of acute abdomen in patients undergoing emergency surgery in the past five years at our centre. Records of patients undergone urgent abdominal surgery were retrospectively reviewed from 2015 to 2019. Information relative to age, sex, underlying pathology, and surgery was recorded. The inclusion criteria were age <18 years and undergoing abdominal surgery. Neonates were excluded. The study population consisted of 957 patients. Median age was 9.7 years. Surgical procedure was laparoscopic in 22%, open in 78%. Common diagnoses were appendicitis in 815 patients, bowel obstruction in 72, adnexal and gynaecological pathology in 43, trauma in 9, complicated Meckel's diverticulum in 8. Rare findings included omental pathology (2), endometriosis (2), ectopic pregnancy (1), intestinal duplication (1), internal hernia (1), Amyand's hernia (1), epiploic appendix torsion (1), accessory spleen torsion (1). The aetiologies of acute abdomen in children vary depending on the age. Appendicitis is the most common surgical cause of acute abdomen, followed by other causes. Differential diagnosis, including rare pathologies, is required to predict the right surgical approach and to apply the proper treatment. Imaging techniques sometimes still result too invasive or insufficient, whereas the widespread use of laparoscopy may render surgical exploration acceptable in selected cases."

    "title": "Ectopic Pregnancy with a Normally Located Levonorgestrel-Releasing Intrauterine System in a Woman with Adenomyosis: Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Background: Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a potentially life-threatening condition, often associated with acute abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum. Certain conditions, such as adenomyosis and the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), may represent risk factors for the development of ectopic pregnancy. Management is tailored according to hemodynamic stability, reproductive desires, and associated comorbidities. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 39-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of adenomyosis and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) treated with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). She presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and a rising serum β-human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (β-hCG > 4000 mIU/mL). Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an adnexal mass (24 mm × 19 mm) consistent with a right tubal ectopic pregnancy, associated with hemoperitoneum. The patient, who expressed a desire for definitive sterilization, underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. The procedure was uneventful with minimal intraoperative blood loss. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of right tubal ectopic pregnancy. Literature Review: A case report prompted a focused search of MEDLINE and Scopus (2015-2025) on ectopic pregnancy in users of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems. Eight eligible case-report studies assessing ectopic pregnancy type and device positioning were ultimately included. Conclusions: This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, paying attention to any comorbidities, particularly adenomyosis, the role of minimally invasive surgery, and the possibility of adapting surgical management to the patient's reproductive wishes."

    "title": "Frontier and Inequality Analyses of the Global Burden of Ectopic Pregnancy: Insights from the GBD 2021.",
    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a significant global health concern and is associated with maternal mortality and compromised future fertility. This research aims to refine the assessment of EP's global impact and its associated inequalities. EP's incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were analyzed using the data from the Global Burden of Disease study from 1990 to 2021. Decomposition analysis was performed to examine the roles of ageing, population growth, and epidemiological changes. Novel frontier and health inequality analyses (Slope Index of Inequality, Concentration Index) were conducted to evaluate socio-demographic disparities. From 1990 to 2021, the global age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) decreased from 305.9 to 212.87 per 100,000. However, absolute DALYs increased from 288,083 to 396,856, with the highest burden shifting to the 20-24 age group. Health inequality analysis revealed a significant but narrowing absolute disparity (SII: -56.68 to -36.56), while frontier analysis identified sub-Saharan African nations with the largest unmet potential for health improvement. Decomposition showed that population growth and epidemiological changes were primary drivers of rising DALYs. Declining EP incidence masks increasing absolute burden and persistent severe inequities. Our findings underscore an urgent public health imperative: to implement equity-focused interventions that enhance early diagnosis, safe management, and the preservation of fertility, particularly in low-resource settings. EP has posed a considerable health challenge, especially in areas defined by low- and middle-income status. This study analyzes the GBD data from 1990 to 2021 to provide updated estimates related to the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs associated with EP. Our comprehensive examination indicated a reduction in the occurrence of EP; however, there is an accompanying increase in the overall mortality and years lived with disability, underscoring persistent challenges in this domain. This work reveals significant health disparities across different regions globally and highlights the necessity for enhancing reproductive health services and implementing targeted interventions to improve outcomes for women impacted by EP worldwide."

    "abstract": "Approximately 1% of all ectopic pregnancies are located within the uterine interstitial space or cornua. The mortality rate has been reported as 2%-2.5% if left untreated. Traditional treatment of interstitial pregnancy includes methotrexate medical management, interstitial wedge resection or cornuostomy. We present a case of hysteroscopic resection of an interstitial pregnancy using a hysteroscopic resectoscope in a woman in her 20s, gravida 2, para 1 at 6 weeks of gestation who presented to the emergency room for vaginal bleeding. She was diagnosed by ultrasound with an interstitial ectopic pregnancy. Given the patient's desired future fertility, resection was performed using a hysteroscopic resectoscope with minimal blood loss. The patient achieved a future pregnancy. We conclude that a hysteroscopic resectoscope may be used for the treatment of an unruptured interstitial ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Most cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies fail during the first 2 months of pregnancy, but ongoing cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies are the precursors of placenta accreta spectrum. The aim of this study was to evaluate placentation inside a cesarean scar defect of the lower uterine segment and its relation to development of placenta accreta spectrum. We reviewed the ultrasound and histopathologic findings of 94 patients diagnosed with a first-trimester cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy including 92 managed by transcervical suction curettage and 2 managed by hysterectomy after failed conservative surgery and of 10 patients with ultrasound signs suggestive of accreta placentation during the second (n=2) and third trimester of pregnancy (n=8), managed by cesarean hysterectomy. The ultrasound features of both groups were compared with general histopathological examination. Cytokeratin 7 immunostaining was used to evaluate the migration pattern of extravillous trophoblast in 13 cases of live cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies after surgical evacuation and samples from 9 hysterectomy specimens with placental tissue in situ. In the cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy group there were 61/92 (65%) with a live pregnancy and 33 (35%) with a failed pregnancy and 2 with prolonged retention of placental tissue that required an emergency secondary hysterectomy due to uncontrollable hemorrhage after transcervical suction curettage. All cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies presented with marked dilatation of the vascular network around the gestational sac and 32 (34%) cases were reported as presenting with abnormally increased vascularity. Anchoring villi directly attached to the decidua were found in only 7 (11.5%) live pregnancies and not in failed pregnancy. Histopathological examination in failed cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies showed signs of villous retention and degeneration including fibrotic and edematous villi and diffuse perivillous fibrin deposition following embryonic demise but no signs of aneuploidy or trophoblastic hyperplasia. Extravillous trophoblast cells arranged in deep confluent sheets or scattered deep inside the decidua below the anchoring villi were observed in 4 cases of live cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies and deep inside the scar area in 2 samples from the hysterectomy specimens. In second trimester placenta accreta spectrum, there was increased subplacental vascularity and intraplacental lacunae in both cases. Extended remodeling of the lower uterine segment and anomalies of the utero- and intraplacental circulation were found on preoperative ultrasound examination in all third-trimester placenta accreta spectrum cases. All samples (n=35) from the accreta area in cesarean hysterectomy specimens showed histological evidence of myometrial thinning, disarray of myofibers and tissue edema. In 28 of these samples, thick fibrinoid depositions between the scar and the villous tissue were found. Immunostaining of accreta areas showed extravillous trophoblast cells deep below the placental basal plate. They reached but did not breach the uterine serosa in any case. Accreta placentation is a progressive phenomenon where villi become abnormally attached inside the myometrial scar, requiring surgical removal. While the adherent villi give rise to large numbers of migratory extravillous trophoblast, the placenta does not spontaneously breach the outer layer of the scar even when it bulges outside the normal uterine boundary."

    "abstract": "The standard of care for adnexal torsion in children is surgical detorsion and ovarian preservation. However, the duration of symptoms beyond which irreversible tissue damage occurs is unknown. Our objective was to define an upper limit for the window of viability when performing surgical intervention in pediatric patients with ovarian torsion. We conducted a single institution retrospective case series of pediatric and adolescent patients (age 1-17 years) diagnosed with adnexal torsion from April 2015 to June 2024 to investigate the association of symptom duration and long-term adnexal viability. Patients with long term adnexal preservation vs. loss were compared using bivariate and logistic analyses. There were 95 cases with suspected ovarian torsion who underwent operative intervention from April 2015 to July 2024. Of 34 patients meeting inclusion criteria, ovarian detorsion was performed in 22 patients and 12 patients were treated with oophorectomy and/or salpingectomy. Three patients (14 %) initially treated with ovarian detorsion required a second operation for detorsion within 12 months. One patient (8.7 %) was found to have no visible ovary on postoperative ultrasound 32 days after detorsion. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified optimal cutoff time from symptom onset to operating room of 34.7 h (area under the curve: 0.73). Upon logistic regression, patients with duration from symptom onset to operating room of ≥34 h had 6.67-fold higher odds of adnexal organ loss compared to those with symptom duration <34 h (95 % CI 1.38-32.28; p = 0.02). Our institutional series identified a possible upper limit of 34 h from symptom onset to detorsion to be associated with ovarian viability as documented on postoperative ultrasonography. We believe that all children and adolescents should be treated with urgent ovarian conservation that should occur well within 34 h of symptom onset. IV."

    "abstract": "Objective: This retrospective cohort study aimed to identify independent clinical predictors specifically associated with the laterality of ovarian torsion, rather than examining potential associations with patient age or serum hormonal profiles. The analysis sought to improve diagnostic accuracy and preoperative risk stratification in ovarian torsion, a gynecologic emergency where fertility preservation is a priority. Materials and Methods: Data from 64 patients with surgically confirmed ovarian torsion between January 2018 and June 2025 were retrospectively reviewed at Harran University Faculty of Medicine. Demographic, clinical, ultrasonographic, and hormonal data were collected. Hormonal assays were performed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (Roche Diagnostics). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to identify factors independently associated with torsion laterality. Results: The median age of the 64 patients included in the study was 22 years (IQR: 20-33). Right ovarian torsion was detected in 65.6% of the cases. In the final multivariate logistic regression model, nulliparity (VIRGO) (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.07-0.75; p = 0.015) and the presence of a cyst (OR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.02-0.53; p = 0.007) were found to be independent and significant predictors of torsion laterality. Both variables demonstrated an effect that reduced the probability of left ovarian torsion. No significant association was found between patient age, parity, other clinical features, and hormonal profiles (progesterone, E2, FSH, LH). The main reason for the lack of backing for the hormonal hypothesis was that hormone measurements in 95.3% of the patients were conducted during the follicular phase, a time at which progesterone and estrogen levels are typically low compared to the luteal phase. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, in addition to the anatomical predisposition for right ovarian torsion, nulliparity (VIRGO) and cyst presence are independent clinical indicators of ovarian torsion laterality. The absence of these features (VIRGO and cyst presence) increases the risk of right-sided torsion. The findings offer valuable information to enhance the index of clinical suspicion in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with ovarian torsion symptoms. The importance of prompt detorsion and a conservative surgical approach to preserve ovarian viability and secure long-term reproductive health is emphasized."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a rare but serious cause of acute abdominal pain in female children, and delayed diagnosis can result in infertility. In this case series of five pediatric patients, we report a case in which point-of-care ultrasound demonstrated a unique finding that we refer to as the \"pseudo-bladder sign.\" In this case, a collapsed bladder led to the misidentification of an ovarian cyst as the bladder, contributing to a delayed diagnosis of ovarian torsion. To provide a clearer understanding of this phenomenon, we additionally present four cases in which radiology-performed ultrasound demonstrated the \"double-bladder sign,\" where a cyst simulated a second bladder. Although these signs indicate the presence of a pelvic cyst rather than torsion itself, they may serve as a diagnostic clue for ovarian torsion when accompanied by acute abdominal pain. Recognition of these findings, combined with accurate knowledge of female pelvic anatomy and systematic scanning in transverse and longitudinal planes, may facilitate earlier diagnosis, help prevent diagnostic delays, and potentially reduce the risk of ovarian loss."

The patient presented for emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress. Spinal anesthesia was given per our hospital protocol. Intraoperative findings revealed a live abdominal pregnancy, with an intact gestational sac located on the left posterior uterine aspect, involving the entire fallopian tube, ovary, and infundibulopelvic ligament. After evaluating the surgical findings, the Obstetrician decided to leave the placenta in situ due to the extensive vascular supply. During this time, general anesthesia was given, as the patient started to bleed, and she needed to be resuscitated. The patient underwent surgical and intensive care management, including major transfusion, and was discharged in stable condition. This case highlights the diagnostic and anesthetic challenges of advanced abdominal pregnancies and the importance of multidisciplinary care."

Its diagnosis is often delayed due to the misleading reassurance provided by the confirmation of an intrauterine pregnancy. We report the case of a 41-year-old gravida 6, para 3 woman with a history of triple-scarred uterus and prior ectopic pregnancy, who presented in hemorrhagic shock at 5 weeks and 4 days of gestation. Initial transabdominal ultrasound identified an intrauterine gestational sac and a suspected ruptured adnexal mass. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a ruptured right tubal ectopic pregnancy with massive hemoperitoneum. A right salpingectomy and hemostatic uterine curettage were performed, and the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilization. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of heterotopic pregnancy in spontaneous conception, the importance of systematic adnexal assessment even after identifying an intrauterine pregnancy, and the need for urgent surgical intervention in hemodynamically unstable patients. Preservation of the intrauterine pregnancy remains a primary consideration when feasible; however, maternal stabilization is paramount. Early recognition and prompt surgical management are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with heterotopic pregnancy. Increased vigilance is warranted, particularly in patients with risk factors such as prior ectopic pregnancy or tubal pathology."

    "abstract": "Acute hemoperitoneum represents a gynecological and surgical emergency with significant morbidity if diagnosis and intervention are delayed. In women of reproductive age, the etiology is most frequently ruptured ectopic pregnancy; however, when pregnancy testing is negative, the differential diagnosis becomes considerably broader and less well defined. Hematosalpinx, although most commonly associated with ectopic gestations, may also occur secondary to non-pregnancy-related etiologies, including endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or primary tubal pathology. In rare instances, chronic hematosalpinx can rupture or leak, leading to substantial intraperitoneal hemorrhage and clinical features that mimic more common acute abdominal emergencies. This diagnostic uncertainty may obscure timely recognition and delay appropriate management. This case demonstrates acute hemoperitoneum secondary to chronic hematosalpinx in the context of a negative pregnancy test and highlights the diagnostic challenge. Pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound usually represents the first-line imaging modality for suspected adnexal pathology, aiding differentiation between hematosalpinx and ruptured ectopic pregnancy before proceeding to CT or surgical exploration. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are essential for accurate diagnosis, definitive treatment, and preservation of reproductive potential."

The differential diagnosis was later expanded to include heterotopic pregnancy with left haematosalpinx, based on early imaging findings and a suboptimal decline in serial serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels. As a result, an urgent laparoscopic evaluation with evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPOC) was performed, which confirmed the absence of the left ovary and fallopian tube, along with an intrauterine anembryonic pregnancy.

This case report aims to highlight the critical importance of differential diagnosis in preventing clinical mismanagement of this complex obstetric emergency. A 35-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) with recent Dilation and Curettage (D&C) presented with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and elevated β-hCG, initially misdiagnosed as tubal ectopic pregnancy. Initial transvaginal ultrasound detected a right adnexal mass with intrauterine fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated communication between the mass and uterine myometrium. Repeat transvaginal ultrasound confirmed CSP, surgically validated. Combined laparoscopic-hysteroscopic surgery performed uterine perforation repair, CSP resection, and right fallopian tube repositioning. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without complications. Heuristic-driven cognitive bias significantly contributes to diagnostic error.

    "abstract": "Rectal ectopic pregnancy is classified into primary and secondary types, with primary rectal ectopic pregnancy being one of the rarest forms of extrauterine gestation. Currently, there are no standardized guidelines for its diagnosis and treatment. We present a case of primary rectal ectopic pregnancy in a 37-year-old woman with acute abdominal pain and massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Under the premise of gynecological ultrasound suggesting conventional tubal or ovarian ectopic pregnancy, we employed diagnostic single-port laparoscopy to exclude typical adnexal pregnancies. Through comprehensive exploration of both the upper and lower abdominal cavities, we ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of primary rectal ectopic pregnancy. And through coordinated efforts with gastrointestinal surgeons, we performed precise resection of the ectopic gestational tissue while preserving rectal integrity, with prompt control of intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This emergency intervention achieved dual success: lifesaving management coupled with minimally invasive advantages, Enhanced recovery after surgery and resulting in a nearly invisible umbilical incision with optimal cosmetic outcomes. Patients with rectal ectopic pregnancy often present with nonspecific early symptoms, leading to frequent misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis is typically established only after the onset of severe complications. Through a multidisciplinary approach to this rare case and a systematic review of the literature, we have derived the following important clinical insights: 1. Early diagnosis strategy: early identification of REP requires a multimodal approach, including dynamic monitoring of serum β-hCG levels, pelvic ultrasound, and multimodal imaging assessment with CT/MRI. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be performed when necessary to confirm the location and extent of the lesion. 2. Broadening differential diagnosis considerations: in all women of childbearing age who are considered to be pregnant, especially when intrauterine, tubal, or ovarian pregnancy is not detected by ultrasound, REP should be included in the differential diagnosis. 3. Value of Minimally Invasive Surgery: Single-port laparoscopic surgery has demonstrated comprehensive advantages in such emergency surgeries, including minimal invasiveness, rapid recovery, and cosmetic benefits. However, this technique requires the surgeon to possess advanced skills, and the patient must meet the indications for single-port laparoscopic surgery. This article also provides important reference evidence for the development of standardized diagnostic and treatment protocols for rectal ectopic pregnancy."

Of the 27 eligible patients, 15 (aged 7-17 years) participated in the study. Torsion was found on the left side in six patients (40%) and on the right side in nine patients (60%). Almost all patients (80%) were treated laparoscopically. No postoperative complications were encountered. None of the examined variables were significantly correlated with adnexal torsion. Notably, D-dimer levels were higher in patients with adnexal torsion (odds ratio = 1, p = 0.29), with a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.75. No association was observed between D-dimer levels and ovarian torsion in our cohort. Nonetheless, the sensitivity and specificity results lead us to believe that preoperative D-dimer levels could help surgeons in more accurately predicting the possibility of an adnexal torsion in children and adolescents, but this should not replace imaging studies and diagnostic laparoscopy especially in doubtful cases."

    "abstract": "This case report underscores the importance of considering corpus luteum rupture as a potential diagnosis in women presenting with acute abdomen. It describes a case of intraperitoneal bleeding resulting from corpus luteum rupture that occurred after sexual intercourse. A woman in her 20s developed sudden, severe abdominal pain during intercourse and exhibited unstable haemodynamics on arrival. Although point-of-care ultrasound and CT scans identified significant haemoperitoneum, definitive confirmation of a bleeding ruptured corpus luteum cyst was made through laparoscopy. The patient received stabilising care in the emergency department (ED) before undergoing the laparoscopic procedure. She had not been using hormonal contraceptives prior to her ED visit and was started on combined oral contraceptive pills as part of her post-treatment management. This case highlights the importance of recognising corpus luteum rupture as a differential diagnosis, the associated diagnostic difficulties and the preventive role of hormonal contraception in reducing recurrence."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) complicates approximately 1% to 2% of pregnancies. Most EPs implant in the fallopian tube and present in the first trimester; continuation beyond 10 weeks is extremely uncommon. An 18-year-old primigravida at 12 weeks' gestation presented with acute-onset lower abdominal pain, syncope, and 1 week of dark-red spotting. She was hypotensive (BP 90/60 mmHg) and tachycardic (112 bpm) with pale conjunctivae. Abdominal examination revealed lower-quadrant tenderness; pelvic exam showed a closed cervix and a tender posterior fornix. Transabdominal ultrasound demonstrated an empty uterus, a gestational sac with a fetal pole adjacent to the right adnexa, and moderate free intraperitoneal fluid. Emergency laparotomy was performed. Approximately 800 mL of hemoperitoneum was evacuated. The right fallopian tube was found ruptured in the ampullary segment with extrusion of a formed fetus. Right salpingectomy was performed, and hemostasis achieved. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively and recovered without complication. A follow-up ultrasound at 6 weeks showed a normal remaining adnexa. This rare case of a 12-week tubal ectopic pregnancy with an advanced fetus highlights critical diagnostic challenges. Delayed presentation and lack of early prenatal imaging allowed the tubal pregnancy to progress to late gestation. High clinical suspicion and prompt ultrasound evaluation are essential for early detection of atypical ectopic pregnancies, to prevent catastrophic hemorrhage and preserve fertility."

Its occurrence alongside uterine rupture further increases maternal risk. We report the case of a 22-year-old gravida 4, para 1 + 2 Ugandan woman at 28 weeks + 3 days of gestation who presented with lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She had not attended antenatal care or undergone prior imaging. On examination, fetal heart sounds were absent, and the uterus was tender with smaller-than-expected fundal height. A provisional diagnosis of intra-abdominal pregnancy with possible uterine rupture was made. Emergency laparotomy revealed a ruptured uterine fundus with an intact gestational sac containing a macerated stillborn male fetus weighing 1.2 kg. The necrotic tissue was excised, and the uterine defect was repaired in layers. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in stable condition. This case highlights the critical need for early antenatal attendance, access to basic obstetric ultrasound, and timely referral to avert complications associated with advanced extra-uterine pregnancies and uterine rupture. Strengthening maternal health systems and clinical suspicion remains vital to improving outcomes in similar low-resource settings."

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the results of surgery for adnexal torsion at Fukushima Red Cross Hospital over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2023. In cases of adnexal torsion, we evaluated the incidence, torsion site, symptoms, and presence or absence of necrosis and bleeding. Among 1243 surgeries for ovarian tumor performed during the study period, there were 43 cases (3.5%) of adnexal torsion. Of these, 39 cases (91%) were entire ovarian torsion (ovarian and fallopian tube torsion [OFTT]) and 4 cases (9%) were isolated fallopian tube torsion (IFTT). The incidence of ovarian tumors was higher with OFTT, while paraovarian cysts and hydrosalpinx were more common with IFTT. Compared with IFTT, OFTT was associated with more frequent abdominal pain, emergency surgery, and necrosis on pathological diagnosis. Furthermore, in 53% (10/19) of cases with no necrosis on postoperative pathological examination, there was a change in color to dark purple or black that was suspected to represent necrosis during surgery. Adnexal torsion can lead to necrosis of the ovary or fallopian tube; thus, it is important to make an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment as soon as possible. When selecting a surgical procedure in reproductive-aged women, it is recommended that ovarian function - sparing procedures be actively considered, except in cases of advanced necrosis, with the understanding that there is often a discrepancy between intraoperative macroscopic necrosis findings and pathological necrosis that identified by postoperative pathological examination (discrepancy rate was 31% in this study)."

This study evaluated dual-modal photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging for early detection and chronic hypoxia monitoring in OT. Rat models of complete/partial OT were established, with photoacoustic imaging (PAI) tracking tissue oxygen saturation (sO₂) over time, compared to color Doppler parameters (color pixel density [CPD]) and spectral Doppler parameters (peak systolic velocity [PSV], resistance index [RI]). In short-term (6-hour) torsion, PAI and CPD showed similar declining trends, but PAI provided superior sO₂ quantification. In long-term models, PAI detected significant sO₂ reductions at 12 and 24 h, whereas CPD declined only within the first 12 h, highlighting PAI's enhanced accuracy for hypoxia assessment during the 12-24 h window. Histological analysis confirmed that PAI-measured hypoxia correlated with tissue injury severity. These findings demonstrate PAI's reliability in evaluating hypoxia progression and tissue damage, facilitating precise early diagnosis and time-sensitive monitoring in prolonged OT. Combining ultrasound with PAI offers a more effective diagnostic tool for assessing OT progression, particularly in guiding timely interventions for long-term torsion."

Laparoscopic detorsion with ovarian preservation is the standard treatment; however, intraoperative decisions are often difficult when the ovary appears severely ischemic. Evidence on the long-term functional outcomes of preserved, ischemic-appearing ovaries remains limited. This case highlights the potential for delayed recovery of follicular function even when early imaging suggests atrophy. An 11-year-old premenarchal girl presented with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and low-grade fever. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a non-enhancing pelvic mass, raising suspicion of ovarian torsion. Emergency laparoscopy, performed 35 h after symptom onset, revealed a 720° counterclockwise torsion of the left ovary, which was enlarged, dark purple, and located in the pouch of Douglas. Despite the lack of visible reperfusion following detorsion, the ovary was preserved given the absence of neoplastic findings and the patient's young age. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at one month and six months demonstrated progressive atrophy of the affected ovary with complete loss of follicles, strongly suggesting necrosis. Unexpectedly, at 1 year post-surgery, MRI showed renewed follicular development and restoration of ovarian volume. By 2 years, additional follicles were observed. Intraoperative appearance alone is not a reliable predictor of ovarian viability, and complete necrosis is uncommon. This case demonstrates that even severely ischemic ovaries may regain function after prolonged intervals, emphasizing the importance of ovarian preservation and extended follow-up in pediatric torsion cases. The long-term implications for fertility, however, require further study."

From 4565 articles identified, six met the inclusion criteria. Four studies of repeated levonorgestrel (LNG)-ECP use provided very low certainty evidence. Among women who became pregnant after at least one use of LNG-ECP in the conception cycle, women with ectopic pregnancy had increased odds of repeated LNG-ECP use in the conception cycle compared with women with intrauterine pregnancy (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.2). One non-comparative study reported few serious adverse events with repeated pericoital use of LNG-ECP, and two cohort studies of LNG-ECP failure found no differences in pregnancy, fetal/neonatal, infant or child outcomes comparing higher (2.25-9 mg LNG) and lower (0.75-1.5 mg LNG) doses in the conception cycle.

Tubal ectopic pregnancy is defined as the presence of a pregnancy or pregnancy residue in the extra-myometrial portion of the fallopian tube (isthmus, ampulla, or fimbriae), and accounts for 96 to 99% of ectopic pregnancy locations. Management of tubal ectopic pregnancy should depend on both its activity and whether it is symptomatic or not. Regarding emergency management of tubal ectopic pregnancy, it is recommended not to consider expectant management for patients with symptomatic tubal ectopic pregnancy, nor for patients with active tubal ectopic pregnancy (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). It is recommended to offer expectant management as an alternative to medical treatment with MTX (methotrexate) for patients with non-active and asymptomatic tubal ectopic pregnancy (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). It is recommended to offer expectant management as an alternative to surgical treatment for patients with non-active and asymptomatic tubal ectopic pregnancy (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In cases of expectant management of tubal ectopic pregnancy, it is strongly recommended to systematically re-evaluate the patient clinically and biologically at 48hours (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). If hCG levels decrease by more than 15% at 48hours, it is recommended to continue monitoring weekly until negativity, provided there are no signs of symptomatic tubal ectopic pregnancy (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

It is also recommended not to systematically combine mifepristone treatment with an MTX injection to improve the efficacy of medical treatment for tubal ectopic pregnancy (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). Regarding surgical management, in a patient with tubal ectopic pregnancy, it is recommended to perform either salpingotomy or salpingectomy with regard to fertility (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence).

We report a case of diaphragmatic pregnancy and describe its difficult but successful diagnosis and treatment in detail. A 34-year-old woman from northern China was admitted to the hospital with delayed menstruation and right upper abdominal pain with right shoulder pain (Kehr's sign). An initial emergency laparoscopy for suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy revealed hemoperitoneum but failed to identify the ectopic pregnancy tissue, likely due to an incomplete surgical survey. Subsequent serial β-hCG monitoring showed a persistent rise, and MRI localized the ectopic pregnancy tissue at the outer edge of the right lobe of the liver. Conservative treatment with methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy was given in time, which induced a significant biochemical response. However, due to the worsening of abdominal pain despite declining β-hCG levels, indicating a persistent risk of rupture, definitive laparoscopic resection was performed. Intraoperatively, the pregnancy tissue was found to be implanted on the surface of the diaphragm, and the pregnancy tissue was successfully removed completely from the diaphragm with little intraoperative bleeding. Postoperative pathology results confirmed the presence of pregnancy chorionic tissue. The patient recovered well without complications and was discharged 5 days after surgery. This case highlights that Kehr's sign is a crucial diagnostic clue for upper abdominal ectopic pregnancy. A systematic survey of the entire abdomen, including the diaphragm, is mandatory during laparoscopy to avoid diagnostic omission. The sequential combination of chemotherapy and surgical treatment may represent an effective strategy to minimize surgical risk and optimize outcomes for this high-risk condition."

With the increasing role of AI-powered large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, there is a need to examine their performance in obstetric emergencies systematically. This study was designed as a prospective, scenario-based, double-blind study. A total of 15 obstetric and gynecologic emergency scenarios were created based on the literature and current international guidelines (ACOG, RCOG, WHO). Five standard questions were posed to ChatGPT-5 for each scenario: (1) Most likely diagnosis, (2) Investigations to confirm the diagnosis, (3) Hemodynamic stability assessment, (4) Initial treatment approach, and (5) Advanced management options. The same scenarios were independently answered by two obstetricians, an emergency medicine specialist, and an anesthesiologist, and were considered the \"gold standard.\" Responses were scored for guideline compliance, patient safety, and critical information gaps. In addition, quality and understandability were evaluated with modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), Global Quality Score (GQS), and readability indexes [Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI)]. A total of 75 responses were reviewed. High agreement (5/5) was observed in 5 scenarios (33.3%), moderate agreement (4/5) in 7 scenarios (46.7%), and low agreement (≤ 3/5) in 3 scenarios (20.0%). High agreement was particularly evident for well-defined guideline algorithms, such as postpartum hemorrhage, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, shoulder dystocia, and ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Deficiencies in moderate agreement scenarios included insufficient emphasis on mortality risk, omission of scoring systems, incomplete steps in sepsis management, and inadequate specification of fertility-sparing approaches. Low agreement scenarios included severe vaginal hemorrhage, acute bleeding due to malignancy, and traumatic gynecologic emergencies. The mean mDISCERN score of the responses was 4.0 ± 0.7, and the mean GQS was 4.1 ± 0.7. Readability analyses showed that responses contained a moderate amount of technical language (FRES score = 40.5 ± 2.5; FKGL score = 11.6 ± 1.2; SMOG score = 10.9 ± 0.8; and CLI score = 10.9 ± 0.8). The mean lexical density was 0.63. ChatGPT-5 generally produced moderate to good guideline-compliant and confident responses in obstetric and gynecological emergency scenarios. However, its performance was limited in complex cases requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The findings suggest that AI-powered large language models can be a complementary tool in obstetric emergency management, but should not be used alone without expert clinician supervision. Larger, comparative, and multidisciplinary studies will provide more reliable evidence for the clinical integration of these technologies."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and tadalafil against ischemia‑reperfusion (IR) injury in a rat model of ovarian torsion. Female Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n=8/group): Control, IR, IR + tadalafil, IR + HBOT and IR + tadalafil + HBOT. Ovarian torsion was induced under anesthesia for 2 h, followed by daily post‑operative treatments with tadalafil (10 mg/kg) and/or HBOT (2.4 atmospheres absolute for 1 h) for 7 days. Blood and ovarian tissue specimens were collected for analysis at the end of the treatment period. IR‑induced ovarian tissue injury significantly decreased the counts of primordial, primary and preantral follicles compared with those in the control group. In addition, serum ELISA and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that IR injury reduced anti‑Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels in serum and the granulosa cells of primary, preantral and secondary follicles. HBOT alone resulted in a significant increase in the counts of primordial, primary and preantral cells, as did the combination of HBOT with tadalafil. In addition, AMH immunoreactivity significantly increased in primary, preantral and secondary follicles following treatment with HBOT and tadalafil. Furthermore, all therapeutic interventions elevated serum AMH levels in the IR model rats. These findings suggest that tadalafil treatment combined with HBOT may help protect ovarian reserve and mitigate IR‑induced tissue damage in rat ovaries."

This case report not only highlights the rarity of this event but also the potential diagnostic challenges involved. A 29-year-old woman with a history of ectopic pregnancy and prior left salpingectomy presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and bleeding during early pregnancy. She reported bilateral lower abdominal pain, which had progressively worsened over two days. Her pregnancy had been recently confirmed, and her obstetrician-gynecologist (OBGYN) was monitoring her beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels. At the time of presentation to the emergency room, her beta-HCG levels had decreased compared to the levels recorded a week earlier. Ultrasound evaluation revealed a right ectopic pregnancy with possible hemoperitoneum. Laparoscopic evaluation subsequently identified the ectopic pregnancy in the left fallopian tube stump. The patient's hemoglobin level at presentation was 7.4 g/dL, necessitating a blood transfusion. The patient underwent successful surgical intervention and was discharged the following day. There is limited literature regarding tubal stump ectopic pregnancies, and no established guidelines exist to address their prevention. One case study has suggested a potential association between tubal stump length and the risk of future tubal stump ectopic pregnancy. Maintaining a high index of suspicion is critical in such cases, especially when clinical symptoms are non-specific and may mimic other gynecologic conditions. The patient's preservation of fertility is a testament to the success of early recognition and surgical intervention in such complex cases. The initial misinterpretation of ultrasound findings suggests the need for advanced imaging techniques to confirm the precise location of rare ectopic pregnancies. Further exploration of this area could help improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 20-year-old primary gravida at 26 weeks of gestation presented with acute abdominal pain. At a rural facility that she had consulted earlier, abdominal pelvic ultrasonography had suggested adnexal pathology, most likely ovarian torsion, and an exploratory laparotomy had been performed. No adnexal pathology had been found, and the procedure had been abandoned. The patient was transferred to our center in hemodynamic instability. Repeat ultrasonography identified a large right subhepatic cystic lesion with differentials including choledochal cyst (CC), benign retroperitoneal cyst, and ovarian/paraovarian cyst. MRIs subsequently confirmed a giant right upper quadrant cyst compressing hepatobiliary structures, correlating with the development of clinical jaundice. This clarified the etiology and eliminated the need for further unnecessary gynecologic surgery. The patient was managed with ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage, which safely decompressed the biliary system, relieved mass effect, and reduced rupture risk in the context of high maternal-fetal surgical risk. The intervention stabilized the patient, facilitated definitive cyst excision before normal vaginal delivery at 36+6 weeks. Based on this experience and a review of the relevant literature, we suggest that in selected cases of undifferentiated abdomino-pelvic cysts during pregnancy, particularly in resource-limited or emergency settings without access to advanced imaging, ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage may be a valuable diagnostic and temporizing measure. This approach can safely bridge patients to definitive management and may help avoid unnecessary laparotomy."

A 33-year-old patient presented with pelvic pain lasting three weeks and was scheduled for a laparoscopy due to the presence of bilateral ovarian cysts, with a dermoid cyst identified on the left ovary. During the procedure, it was discovered that both the left fallopian tube and ovary were absent. The infundibulo-pelvic ligament appeared to terminate abruptly at the pelvic brim. Moreover, an 8 cm pelvic mass was found lodged in the cul-de-sac, which was extensively adherent to the bowel and the uterus, and was covered by vascular omental tissue. Histopathological analysis revealed that this pelvic mass was a dermoid cyst. The cyst contained adipose tissue, hair, and microscopic ovarian stroma, confirming the diagnosis. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing and managing pelvic masses. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for ovarian torsion and consider the possibility of autoamputation when an ovary is not found in its anatomical location, especially if imaging suggests the presence of a dermoid cyst. This case also underscores the importance of meticulous surgical dissection for the complete removal of such masses."

    "abstract": "Adnexal torsion diagnosis in children relies heavily on ultrasound, but existing literature lacks standardization of technique and handling of equivocal results. To assess the accuracy of transabdominal ultrasound (US) in diagnosing adnexal torsion in pediatric patients and evaluate optimal clinical decision-making for equivocal US reads. Retrospective review of pelvic US exams and surgical data for girls aged 1-18 years from 2015 to 2019 at a pediatric quaternary care hospital. US reports were coded as positive, negative, or equivocal for torsion. Surgical findings were used to confirm final diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated under various scenarios for handling equivocal reads. This study included 4,396 ultrasound exams from 3,707 patients (median age, 15.2 years [IQR: 12.8-16.8]). Ovarian visualization rate was 97-98%. US was read as positive for torsion in 1% of adnexae, negative in 95%, and equivocal in 4%. Among 179 surgical cases, torsion was present in 52%. Sensitivity of US for torsion was highest (86.0%) when equivocal cases were considered positive (EqP), but PPV was lowest (29.9%) under this condition. Area under the ROC curve was greatest (0.8651) when equivocal US were counted as positive. US reads were more likely to be true positive for isolated ovarian torsion compared to when tubal torsion was present (p = 0.003). A standardized transabdominal US protocol yields high ovarian visualization rates, and treating equivocal reads as positive can optimize diagnostic accuracy when combined with clinical decision-making. US maybe be less accurate in detecting tubal torsion compared to isolated ovarian torsion, but this finding should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size. Overall, these results provide clinically relevant insights to guide management and future research in pediatric adnexal torsion."

    "abstract": "Transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (TU-LESS) has been widely used in multiple gynecological fields, but the report on its use during during pregnancy is limited. This study aimed to assess the safety and feasibility of TU-LESS for gynecological diseases at different pregnancy stages, and evaluate the application of Zheng's anchor suturing for pregnant women. An observational study was conducted retrospectively on pregnant women who underwent TU-LESS during pregnancy between September 4th, 2019 and May 23th, 2024, at the West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University. The umbilical incision was sutured using Zheng's anchor suturing technique. Patients' characteristics and perioperative outcomes were collected from the medical record system. The postoperative outcomes, obstetric outcomes and cosmetic satisfaction for incision were collocted by telephone follow-up. Subsequently, the clinical characteristics, perioperative data, and obstetric outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Perioperative data of patients in the first and second trimesters were analyzed. In total, 75 patients were included, 23 of whom were in their first trimester and 52 were in their second trimester. There were 56 cases of adnexal mass, 15 cases of adnexal torsion, 2 cases of rupture of adnexal mass, and 2 cases of intrauterine pregnancy combined with ectopic pregnancy. All surgeries were performed by TU-LESS and no perioperative complications occurred on patients during hospitalization. More emergent surgeries (9/14) were performed in the first trimester, and more elective surgeries (5/47) were performed in the second trimester (P = 0.008). No significant differences were found in the perioperative data (operative time, postoperative Activities of Daily Living, and postoperative pain intensity, postoperative hospital stay, total hospital stay) between patients in the first and second trimesters. Most incisions healed well except in one patient who had secondary suturing for incisional dehiscence. A total of 59 patients completed the follow-up for obstetric outcomes, 3 of whom experienced fetal loss and the remaining 56 patients had live births. Among the 56 patients who had live births, 27 of them had vaginal delivery and 29 had Cesarean section. The interval from TU-LESS to childbirth was 23.3 ± 4.4 weeks. No incisonal dehiscence or hernia occurred in patients who underwent vaginal delivery. TU-LESS is a safe and effective method for treating gynecological diseases during pregnancy, both in the first and second trimesters, with few perioperative complications. The umbilical incision sutured with Zheng's anchor suturing technique can withstand the tension of a growing abdomen and the pressure of uterine contractions during labor."

    "title": "Enhancing Detection and Management of Spontaneous Bilateral Ectopic Pregnancies: Insights From a Rare Case.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Ectopic pregnancy is a common gynecological emergency occurring when fertilization implants outside the uterine cavity. Bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancy (BTP), in which there are simultaneous pregnancies in both fallopian tubes, is exceedingly rare. BTP diagnosis is challenging as symptoms mimic unilateral cases, and imaging often fails to identify both sites. No standardized follow-up protocols exist, leading to potential clinical oversight and delayed management. While BTP is more commonly associated with assisted reproductive technologies, spontaneous cases are even rarer. CASE REPORT We present a case of spontaneous BTP in a 28-year-old woman initially treated for unilateral ectopic pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasonography suggested a right tubal ectopic pregnancy, but laparoscopy revealed a left ectopic pregnancy, requiring salpingectomy. Despite the discrepancy between imaging and surgical findings, no additional follow-up was arranged. The patient re-presented 17 days post-surgery with persistent abdominal pain and shoulder tip pain. Initially diagnosed as postoperative infection, subsequent ultrasound revealed a live ectopic pregnancy in the right tube. Emergency surgery confirmed a ruptured right tubal pregnancy necessitating a second salpingectomy. CONCLUSIONS This rare case highlights the diagnostic challenges of bilateral ectopic pregnancies and emphasizes the need for thorough examination of both fallopian tubes during assessment and surgery. When discrepancies exist between imaging and intraoperative findings, clinicians should maintain vigilance for BTP. This case demonstrates the need for comprehensive postoperative monitoring when imaging-surgical discrepancies occur. Clinicians should consider bilateral ectopic pregnancy when patients present with persistent symptoms following treatment for unilateral ectopic pregnancy. Improved awareness and standardized protocols could enhance early detection and preserve fertility in these rare cases."

    "abstract": "Isolated fallopian tube torsion is a rare but critical gynecologic emergency that often presents a diagnostic challenge owing to its nonspecific symptoms and infrequent occurrence. CASE PRESENTATION: This paper discusses the case of a 37-year-old Saudi female who was hospitalized with acute right lower quadrant pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The initial differential diagnosis included ovarian torsion and appendicitis. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a right fallopian tube twisted five times, which was later confirmed to be necrotic. Given the irreversible damage to the fallopian tube, a right salpingectomy was performed. The patient recovered well postoperatively and was discharged after 48 h without complications. This case report underscores the importance of considering isolated fallopian tube torsion in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain and highlights the need for prompt surgical intervention to prevent severe complications. The rarity of isolated tubal torsion, normal Doppler findings despite significant torsion, and the surgical management decisions impacting fertility make this case an informative addition to current literature."

She underwent two manual uterine evacuations at a regional hospital, and histopathology confirmed a complete hydatidiform mole. She was referred to a gestational trophoblastic disease reference center with severe pelvic pain and persistent vomiting for two days, refractory to analgesics. On admission, she exhibited signs of peritoneal irritation. Ultrasound revealed the presence of theca-lutein cysts in the left ovary and torsion of the right ovary. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed adnexal torsion and necrosis, requiring right salpingo-oophorectomy. Postoperative recovery was favorable, and serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels normalized after nine months of follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering ovarian torsion as a possible complication in patients with molar pregnancy presenting with acute abdominal symptoms. Timely imaging is crucial for diagnosis and may allow conservative management, although adnexectomy remains necessary in cases of established necrosis. Awareness of this rare but serious complication is essential for prompt diagnosis and preservation of reproductive potential."

We report a case of a 34-year-old female with a history of cesarean delivery who presented to the emergency department with complaints of lower abdominal pain and amenorrhea for nine weeks. Transabdominal ultrasound showed an empty uterine cavity and empty cervical canal, with a viable gestational sac implanted in the anterior lower uterine segment at the site of the previous cesarean scar. The patient underwent laparotomy with scar excision. Laparoscopy is not commonly utilized in our setting, as there is only one laparoscopic operating theater available, which is primarily used by general surgery; consequently, all gynecology and obstetrics procedures are performed through conventional open approaches. Surgical excision of the ectopic gestation was completed without intraoperative complications. This case reinforces the need for early recognition and surgical excision of viable CSEP in order to prevent disastrous complications like uterine rupture or massive hemorrhage. It also highlights the role that imaging plays in both diagnosis and surgical planning for patients who may want future reproductive opportunities."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an uncommon but increasingly recognized cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), myocardial infarction (MI), and sudden cardiac death, particularly in younger individuals without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Pregnancy-associated SCAD (P-SCAD) is a specific subset of SCAD that accounts for a significant number of MIs in pregnant and postpartum women. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that is used for medical termination of pregnancy and has been associated with coronary vasospasm in rare cases; however, our case highlights a potential new association between this drug and SCAD.  A 29-year-old African American woman with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency room with seizure-like activity and unresponsiveness witnessed by her sister while they were traveling on a road trip few hours after taking Misoprostol for termination of an ectopic pregnancy. Coronary angiography showed focal 95% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery with TIMI 1 flow concerning spontaneous coronary artery dissection versus coronary vasospasm. A decision was made to proceed with percutaneous coronary intervention to the LAD. The procedure was complicated by no reflow and retrograde advancement of dissection/hematoma to the left main coronary artery, requiring further stenting with overlapping stents from the ostial left main coronary artery to the proximal LAD artery. During the procedure, the patient developed multiple cardiac arrests with pulseless electrical activity requiring advanced cardiac life support, pressors, and left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement for mechanical circulatory support. She subsequently showed marked improvement and was successfully weaned off vasopressors, and the LVAD was removed by day 4 in the ICU. On day 8, the patient was successfully extubated. The follow-up 2D echocardiogram showed improvement in the ejection fraction to 40-45%. The patient was safely discharged and made significant cardiovascular recovery. This is an interesting case discussion highlighting a rare and potential association between a commonly prescribed medication and a serious cardiovascular complication. It has been observed that SCAD occurs with higher frequency during pregnancy, peripartum period, and with the use of exogenous hormones although the exact etiology remains unclear. More research should be done to better understand the potential cardiovascular adverse effects of Misoprostol, especially on patients with underlying SCAD."

The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with a total hysterectomy. Intraoperative findings included a highly vascular, 20-week-sized uterus and a gestational sac located in the posterior lip of the cervix.

Pregnancy rarely occurs in this horn, and if it does, it usually ruptures in the first or second trimester of pregnancy. It can be missed during antenatal ultrasound scanning and carries a high risk of maternal and fetal mortality. A 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1 Ethiopian woman presented with a gestational age of 29 3/7 weeks and sudden onset abdominal pain of 9 hours of duration. At presentation, the patient was in hemorrhagic shock with abdominal tenderness and signs of fluid collection, and the fetal heart rate was 124 bpm. The patient's hemoglobin level was 9.4 g/dL. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy for a ruptured rudimentary horn with active bleeding. Excision of the rudimentary horn was performed, and the mother was discharged with improvement. Although pregnancies in a rudimentary horn rarely progress to the third trimester of pregnancy, this condition should be suspected in patients with hemodynamic instability and abdominal pain. Excision of the rudimentary horn can prevent maternal mortality."

    "abstract": "Ovarian tumors are quite uncommon in the premenarchal age group, with the majority being functional cysts. Malignant tumors are unusual in this age group, making the diagnosis of ovarian malignancy in children quite challenging. Dysgerminoma is the most common malignant ovarian germ cell tumor in females. The clinical symptoms often include abdominal pain, distension, a palpable mass, reduced appetite, nausea, and vomiting. We discuss the case of an 11-year-old premenarchal girl who was brought to the emergency department with abdominal pain persisting for 3-4 days, which had intensified over the 24 hours before she arrived at the emergency department. The pain was accompanied by vomiting. On examination, her lower abdomen showed tenderness, guarding, and rigidity, and a firm mass approximately 10 x 8 cm in size was palpable in the midline. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large hypoechoic mass lesion, approximately 99 x 56 x 92 mm, in the right adnexa. A magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis was performed for confirmation, which substantiated the diagnosis of the right ovarian lesion with torsion. Following the patient's exploratory laparotomy, a right salpingo-oophorectomy and left oophoropexy were performed. The histopathological report confirmed the diagnosis of dysgerminoma. Malignant ovarian tumors are quite rare in the premenarchal age group, and the primary goal should be to offer fertility-preserving surgeries. This allows the individual to retain reproductive functions. However, close monitoring is essential, and if needed, radical surgery should be considered to save the patient's life."

    "title": "Ovarian Torsion in Normal Ovaries in Reproductive-Aged Women.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency caused by the rotation of an ovary on its supporting ligaments, which can obstruct blood flow and lead to ovarian necrosis if untreated. Typically, torsion is associated with ovaries enlarged by cysts or masses, which increase the likelihood of rotation around the supporting ligaments. Although torsion can also occur in normal ovaries, especially in premenarchal girls with elongated infundibulopelvic ligaments, literature on this occurrence in reproductive-aged women is limited. This report presents two cases of ovarian torsion in normal ovaries, highlighting diagnostic and management challenges. The first case involves a 19-year-old who presented with acute right iliac fossa pain. Ultrasound showed a normal ovary with intact blood flow. However, due to ongoing pain, she underwent laparoscopy, which confirmed a 1.5-twist torsion at the utero-ovarian ligament. Right ovarian detorsion was performed successfully, and her postoperative recovery was uneventful, with follow-up ultrasound showing no abnormalities. The second case describes a 40-year-old woman with a prior hysterectomy, presenting with left iliac fossa pain. Ultrasound showed an enlarged, heterogeneous left ovary (5 × 3.2 × 4.2 cm) with poor blood flow and complex free pelvic fluid, raising suspicion for torsion. Emergency laparoscopy confirmed a 2-twist torsion on the infundibulopelvic ligament. Despite attempts at detorsion, the ovary remained nonviable, leading to left oophorectomy. These cases emphasize that ultrasound and Doppler findings may not reliably detect torsion in normal ovaries. Laparoscopy remains the definitive method for diagnosis and intervention, providing timely treatment that is essential to preserve ovarian function. Clinicians should maintain a high suspicion for torsion in reproductive-aged women with acute abdominal pain, even if imaging is inconclusive, to prevent severe complications. These cases highlight the need for heightened awareness of ovarian torsion in normal ovaries to optimize surgical outcomes and fertility preservation."

Multi-center, retrospective observational study. Patients undergoing surgery for ovarian torsion. The primary outcome was the time from emergency room presentation to the operating room (OR) based on the surgeon's gender. Secondary analyses included the effects of attending surgeon seniority, gender of the diagnosing clinician, time of day, and the post-graduate year (PGY) of the trainee evaluating the patient. We included 141 subjects with ovarian torsion. The patients averaged 32±8.7 years old with a BMI of 30±7.9 and were predominantly white (54.6%) or black (19.1%). They were more often operated on by a female attending surgeon (57.4%) and initially seen by a female clinician (55.3%). Median time from presenting to the ED to entry in the OR was 396 minutes [IQR=254.5 to 627.5]. Most surgeries were performed 7am-7pm (61.7%) by attending physicians in practice >10 years (63.8%). Using linear regression models, neither the gender of the diagnosing physician (β=0.016, p=0.90) nor the operating physician (β=-0.036, p=0.78) impacted the time to OR entry. Increasing BMI reduced time to the OR by 2.6 minutes per unit (β=-0.017, p=0.03).and increasing PGY was associated with faster OR entry times, with patients arriving to the OR 31 minutes faster per PGY(β=-0.114, p=0.01). Surgeon gender does not appear to impact OR timing for ovarian torsion cases. With a retrospective trial design and multiple comparisons, the findings of faster OR entry with increasing resident PGY and with increasing BMI should be seen as hypothesis-generating conclusions."

While adnexal torsion is a known cause of acute abdomen in reproductive-age women, co-presentation with appendicitis is exceptionally uncommon. This case underlines the importance of considering gynecological differentials in women presenting with acute abdominal pain. A 39-year-old woman presented with right lower abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Initially diagnosed with an appendicular lump, she was managed conservatively and discharged after symptomatic improvement. Upon recurrence of symptoms, imaging revealed an ovarian dermoid cyst with torsion. Exploratory laparotomy identified a gangrenous ovary with a twisted cyst and adherent appendix. Histopathology confirmed acute appendicitis and a benign dermoid cyst. Adnexal torsion occurs when the ovary and fallopian tube twist around their ligaments, often caused by ovarian cysts like dermoid cysts. These cysts are common in young women and can lead to acute abdominal pain, requiring urgent surgery to prevent ovarian damage. Diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms mimic other conditions like appendicitis. Imaging such as ultrasonography or computed tomography is used, and treatment involves surgical untwisting or removal of affected tissues. Torsion sometimes affects nearby organs, like an appendix. This case highlights the rare occurrence of simultaneous appendicitis and ovarian torsion, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Tubal ectopic pregnancy (TEP) frequently presents as a gynaecological emergency, often necessitating prompt medical intervention. Although methotrexate therapy offers the advantage of being non-invasive, it still poses the risk of tubal rupture and consequent haemorrhage, which may require emergency surgery. The major challenges encountered in practice are the lack of reliable methods to anticipate the likelihood of failure of single-dose methotrexate therapy and identify associated risk factors and thereby preclude unnecessary medical procedures. Effective counselling, therefore, remains a pivotal step in clinical management. This study is aimed at developing a predictive model to assess response to single-dose methotrexate therapy in cases of TEP by employing a dynamic prediction model approach based on the clinical data of a large cohort. This multicentre study will encompass 100 and 900 participants for the prospective and retrospective cohorts with TEP, respectively. Between 2010 and 2024, eligible patients who are diagnosed with TEP and opt for single-dose methotrexate therapy will be recruited as part of a retrospective cohort, from three participating hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. The comprehensive medical and obstetric histories of the patients will be collected, along with their clinical data, including the results of serological tests following the initial consultation. The control group will comprise patients who achieve uneventful, complete resolution of TEP, as evidenced by serum human chorionic gonadotropin level of <5 IU/L, without necessitating further treatment. The case group will include individuals requiring additional medical (further methotrexate) or surgical interventions. The dynamic prediction model developed in this manner will be employed on the longitudinal data. Additionally, data will be collected from two other hospitals between 2024 and 2026, as an external prospective cohort to validate the accuracy of the prediction model.

Struma ovarii, a monodermal teratoma, consists of over 50% thyroid tissue and accounts for 2.7% of ovarian teratomas. It typically affects women aged 40-60 and is exceptionally rare during pregnancy. Diagnosis is often only established after surgical intervention and histological examination. We present the case of a 39-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 1) at 19 weeks of gestation who presented with acute lower abdominal pain. At her first visit at 11 weeks, ultrasound revealed a 12 cm multilocular left adnexal mass. Initial conservative management was followed by emergency laparoscopy due to suspected ovarian torsion, resulting in a left oophorectomy. Histopathology confirmed struma ovarii. Thyroid function tests (TSH, FT4) remained within normal limits throughout pregnancy. The pregnancy continued without further complications, culminating in a spontaneous vaginal delivery at 40 + 4 weeks of a healthy female infant weighing 3800 g.

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is an uncommon and potentially life-threatening condition that presents a significant diagnostic challenge, particularly in spontaneous conceptions. We describe the case of a 38-year-old multigravida who presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and signs of hemorrhagic shock. Point-of-care transabdominal ultrasound revealed a moderate volume of intraperitoneal free fluid with echogenic content, raising suspicion for hemoperitoneum or peritonitis, and also demonstrated a viable intrauterine pregnancy at nine weeks' gestation. Emergency laparoscopy confirmed a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the right fallopian tube, requiring salpingectomy and peritoneal lavage. Despite initial maternal stabilization, intrauterine fetal death was confirmed on the first postoperative day. This case underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion in symptomatic pregnant patients, even when an intrauterine pregnancy has been documented and typical risk factors are absent. Timely diagnosis and prompt surgical management remain critical to optimize maternal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecologic emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention to prevent ischemic damage and loss of ovarian function. However, its diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and limitations in imaging modalities. This case report presents two patients with suspected ovarian torsion based on ultrasound findings, both of whom were ultimately found to have alternative diagnoses. One patient underwent surgery, revealing an ovarian endometrioma rather than torsion, while the other was spared unnecessary surgery after MRI findings clarified the diagnosis. These cases underscore the limitations of ultrasound with Doppler as a standalone diagnostic tool and highlight the need for a multimodal imaging approach, incorporating CT or MRI in equivocal cases. A more nuanced analysis is warranted, one that takes into consideration different subpopulations of women by age range and menopausal status to refine clinical management, and also looks at certain diagnostic and imaging features that present within these specific patient groups that can aid in confirming torsion and expediting care. By integrating additional imaging techniques and leveraging emerging diagnostic tools, clinicians can improve accuracy, reduce morbidity, and ensure that surgical intervention is increasingly reserved for true cases of ovarian torsion."

This retrospective cohort study used TriNetX Research Network data to compare adult females (18-49) presenting to the ED with diagnosed ectopic pregnancy between 01/01/2000-01/01/2024, by presence or absence of SDOH Z codes. Propensity score matching balanced baseline demographics and comorbidities. Outcomes assessed over one year after the index event included surgical intervention, hospital admission, ED revisits, analgesic use, mental health diagnoses, and follow-up for gynecologic care, contraception, and sterilization. Risk analyses compared outcome proportions between cohorts, reported as risk ratios (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals. 15,080 matched patients were analyzed. Patients with documented SDOH Z codes were more likely to be hospitalized (RR: 1.473, p < 0.0001), revisit the ED (RR:1.095, p < 0.0001), undergo delayed surgery (RR: 2.030), experience new diagnoses of depression (RR: 1.846, p < 0.0001), anxiety (RR: 1.576, p < 0.0001), and post-traumatic stress disorder (RR: 2.980, p < 0.0001), and have higher opioid use (RR: 1.102, p < 0.0001). They were also more likely to pursue follow-up care for contraception (RR: 1.429, p < 0.0001) and sterilization (RR: 1.928, p < 0.0001). Documented SDOH Z codes were associated with increased risk of hospitalization, ED repeat visits, delayed surgery, and mental health conditions."

    "abstract": "Objective: Splenic ectopic pregnancy is an exceptionally rare and life-threatening form of abdominal ectopic pregnancy, often presenting significant diagnostic and management challenges. We report a case of ruptured splenic ectopic pregnancy initially suspected to be a tubal miscarriage. Case Report: A 36-year-old woman presented with mild left-sided pelvic pain, no vaginal bleeding and a positive pregnancy test. This was an unplanned pregnancy, and she was not sure of her LMP. This presentation in early pregnancy requires ruling out an ectopic pregnancy through clinical assessment and laboratory investigations. Clinical examination showed normal observations and generalized abdominal tenderness with no signs of peritonism. Initial investigations revealed a significantly elevated β-hCG of 24,076 IU/L, and transvaginal ultrasound showed an empty uterus. Given the findings, an ectopic pregnancy was suspected, and diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. During laparoscopy, no ectopic pregnancy was identified in the pelvis, both tubes looked normal, but a left fimbrial cyst was noted, and 300 mL of haemoperitoneum was observed, without active bleeding. A tubal miscarriage was presumed with the plan to follow up β-hCG to confirm resolution of the pregnancy. Postoperatively, the patient developed worsening pain and a significant haemoglobin drop to 97 g/L, inconsistent with the amount of intraoperative blood loss which raised the suspicion of extrapelvic ectopic pregnancy with active bleeding. A contrast-enhanced CT scan identified free blood surrounding the spleen and a 25-mm peripherally enhancing lesion with venous drainage into the splenic vein, consistent with a ruptured splenic ectopic pregnancy. An urgent multidisciplinary team discussion led to surgical management via midline laparotomy and splenectomy. The postoperative course was complicated by ileus, which resolved with conservative management. The patient's β-hCG levels progressively declined, confirming resolution. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering splenic ectopic pregnancy when β-hCG is markedly elevated, and no pelvic ectopic pregnancy is identified. Prompt imaging and diagnosis are crucial to prevent morbidity associated with delayed management."

    "abstract": "Ovarian ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common gynecological emergency, typically caused by ovarian torsion. Pirfenidone (PFN) has demonstrated potential therapeutic benefits due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties. This research aimed to investigate the protective effects of PFN in alleviating ovarian I/R injury in female rats. Female rats received PFN (300 mg/kg/day) for 3 consecutive days, either with or without the induction of ovarian I/R. The study assessed markers of ovarian oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Ovarian histology was analyzed, along with immunohistochemical staining for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). I/R injury resulted in increased oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and a significant reduction in ovarian VEGF-A levels. Histological examination revealed ovarian damage, with increased expression of TLR4 and p38 MAPK. PFN treatment significantly improved the hormonal balance and mitigated oxidative stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers to normal levels. In addition, PFN improved ovarian tissue morphology and decreased TLR4 and p38 MAPK expression. The findings suggest that PFN may offer protective effects against ovarian I/R injury through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, as well as by promoting angiogenesis in the ovary."

We sought to examine the experiences of US emergency physicians in the management of presumed ectopic pregnancy since the Dobbs Supreme Court ruling and passage of new abortion restrictions affecting clinical decision-making around pregnancy termination. This was a cross-sectional survey of US emergency physicians administered online between April 1-15, 2024. The survey was completed by 150 board-certified US emergency physicians-50 physicians each from states categorized as abortion restrictive, semi-restrictive, or permissive-who were queried about any reported delays in or adaptations to the assessment and/or management of patients with known or suspected ectopic pregnancy. We found that 24% of physicians in restrictive or semi-restrictive states reported delays in the management of patients with suspected or confirmed ectopic pregnancy, and 54% of physicians reported adaptations to care of these patients including repeat testing and arranging alternative care in cases where they might previously have delivered definitive care in the emergency department. In a post-Dobbs practice environment, emergency physicians across the United States, practicing in states with various abortion restrictions, reported delays and adaptations of care for patients with presumed or suspected ectopic pregnancy including deviations from standard of care in emergency medicine."

    "abstract": "In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Healthcare organizations across the world introduced various measures to restrict the spread of the disease, with an increasing reliance on telephonic consultations as a key measure to limit exposure to COVID-19 in hospital facilities. This study assesses the impact of restrictive measures on gynecological emergency services by comparing services before the COVID-19 pandemic with services during the first and second waves of the pandemic (COVID-19 Peak 1 and COVID-19 Peak 2). This was a retrospective single-center cross-sectional study comparing the first 50 women attending the emergency department (ED) of the Women's Wellness and Research Center in Qatar with a gynecological complaint during three distinct periods. The peak of the first COVID-19 wave from June 2020 was considered COVID-19 Peak 1, and the peak of the second wave from April 2021 was COVID-19 Peak 2. The control group included 50 women who attended the ED during non-COVID-19 times. Early pregnancy complications (miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy) were compared between the three periods to determine the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on the clinical presentation, subsequent management, and any patient safety issues arising out of this in terms of complications. Data from 50 patients were analyzed during each study period (total = 150). There were no statistically significant differences in age, nationality, and parity between the three groups. The gestational age at diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage was significantly higher, 12.4 ± 4.0 weeks during COVID-19 Peak 1 compared to 10.9 ± 3.6 in pre-COVID-19 and 9.7 ± 3.9 in COVID-19 Peak 2 (p = 0.002). The length of hospital stays (median ± interquartile range) for women with the diagnosis of miscarriage was significantly shorter during COVID-19 Peak 1(1 ± 2 days) compared to pre-COVID-19 (2 ± 1.5) and COVID-19 Peak 2 (1 ± 2), with p < 0.001. There was no difference in patient demographics, symptoms at presentation, type of management, and timing of surgical management. The COVID-19 restrictions led to a major shift in the way healthcare was delivered, with increased use of telephone consultations and prompt early discharge from the hospital. Although we did not record safety issues or adverse outcomes, we found a delay in gestational age at presentation and diagnosis, which has the potential to lead to adverse outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of telemedicine in healthcare practice."

This retrospective case-control study included 221 women aged 18 years and older who underwent laparoscopy for suspected ovarian torsion at Galilee Medical Center from 2011 to 2022. Demographic data, clinical presentation, imaging, laboratory findings, and intraoperative outcomes were extracted and compared between patients with confirmed torsion (n = 96) and those without (n = 125). Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify independent predictors. Ovarian torsion was confirmed in 43.4 % of cases. Torsion was significantly associated with localized abdominal pain (82.3 % vs. 52.4 %,p < 0.001), vomiting (47.3 % vs. 20.0 %,p < 0.001), right-sided tenderness (51.0 % vs. 26.8 %,p = 0.002), and ovarian edema on ultrasound (18.0 % vs. 4.1 %,p = 0.001). Multivariable analysis identified four independent predictors: localized pain (OR 4.36, 95 % CI: 1.94-9.81,p < 0.001), vomiting (OR 2.38, 95 % CI: 1.16-4.89,p = 0.018), ovarian edema (OR 5.29, 95 % CI: 1.45-19.29,p = 0.012), and a non-significant trend toward higher White blood cells count (OR 1.09, 95 % CI: 0.99-1.21,p = 0.077). Localized pain, vomiting, and ultrasonographic ovarian edema independently predict ovarian torsion. Incorporating these markers into diagnostic pathways may improve early detection and guide surgical treatment. Prospective validation of predictive models is necessary."

Training programs, conducted over 12 years, have enhanced the skills of midwives, and nurses, to provide high quality, hospital-based, care to pregnant women, newborn infants, children, and adolescents. A task-shifting partnership between the Ministry of Health, World Health Organisation, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Children's Emergency Fund and the charity Maternal and Childhealth Advocacy International was established in 2012. Rural county health teams selected 37 midwives, 20 nurses, 1 nurse/midwife and 2 physician assistants, for advanced training. They were appointed following a written examination and interview. Obstetric clinician trainees underwent a 3-year programme, which included operative procedures. The training programs for neonatal and paediatric clinician trainees were 2 years and 2.3 years, respectively. Training consisted of apprenticeship-based training and distance learning. It was delivered by Liberian and international specialists. Trainee competence was established by continuous clinical assessment, oral, and written clinical examinations. The programme also upgraded hospital buildings and provided essential equipment and drugs. 59 trainees completed training, 2 failed and 57 qualified in final examinations. 27 are working as obstetric clinicians, 15 are working as neonatal clinicians, and 11 are working as paediatric clinicians. Therefore, 53 are working in 18 hospitals and 4 Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC) facilities. Obstetric clinicians manage major obstetric emergencies. They perform abdominal surgery, including the management of ruptured ectopic pregnancy and basic and complicated caesarean sections. Neonatal clinicians resuscitate and care for sick and premature babies to WHO Special Care Level 2. Paediatric clinicians manage the main paediatric emergencies that contribute to high mortality. Before the arrival of the international trainer, paediatric mortality in the training hospital was 9.5% and was 4.1% in the final year of training. This task shifting programme in Liberia has shown that midwives and nurses can be trained to provide safe and effective hospital care for pregnant women, newborn infants and children. This approach is one solution to the health workforce problem in low resource and conflict settings."

    "abstract": "While tubal ectopic pregnancies and molar pregnancies are relatively common, tubal molar pregnancies are exceptionally rare, with an estimated incidence of 1.5 per 1,000,000 pregnancies. Molar pregnancies are at risk for developing malignant gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (15-20 % for complete hydatidiform moles and 0.5-6 % for partial hydatidiform moles) and warrant robust diagnostic workup to determine appropriate management. Presented here is a case of an isthmic tubal ectopic pregnancy secondary to a partial hydatidiform mole; additionally, a literature review through PubMed discusses all tubal molar pregnancies reported within a 5-year period. A 41-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1) at 6 weeks and 5 days of gestation presented to the emergency department from the outpatient clinic because prenatal ultrasound did not show an intrauterine pregnancy and her a β -hCG level was 17,913 mIU/mL. Due to concern for ectopic pregnancy, she underwent diagnostic laparoscopy, which revealed an unruptured right isthmic tubal ectopic gestation. The specimen was removed and sent for histological evaluation, which confirmed a partial hydatidiform mole that stained positive for p57; the finding was supported by molecular studies. The patient was discharged the same day and follow-up β -hCG levels were monitored weekly until undetectable. The literature review found that 13 tubal molar pregnancies had been reported between 2019 and 2024. Histopathologic examination of gestational trophoblastic disease should be supported by ancillary studies such as immunohistochemical, flow cytometry, and molecular analyses to ensure accurate diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging could offer a way to preoperatively diagnose molar ectopic pregnancy in select hemodynamically stable patients."

No intra-uterine gestational sac was found, and intraperitoneal bleeding was observed, suggesting an ectopic pregnancy. An emergency laparoscopic surgery revealed a blood clot and active bleeding on the peritoneal surface near the ileocecal region, which was resected. Histology revealed sheets of syncytiotrophoblasts and intermediate trophoblast cells without villi, and immunohistochemistry was diffusely positive for Ki-67 and hCG, confirming primary peritoneal choriocarcinoma. Staging imaging revealed no other lesions. The patient received four cycles of MEA chemotherapy (methotrexate, etoposide, actinomycin D) at three-week intervals, resulting in sustained hCG normalization and no evidence of recurrence at follow-up. Primary peritoneal choriocarcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding during early pregnancy. Even when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the excised tissue must be submitted for histopathological examination so that chemotherapy can be initiated promptly in case of choriocarcinoma."

    "abstract": "Conservative treatment remains a viable option for selected patients with ectopic pregnancy (EP), but failure may lead to rupture and serious complications. Currently, serum β-hCG is the main predictor for treatment outcomes, yet its accuracy is limited. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model that integrates radiomic features derived from super-resolution (SR) ultrasound images with clinical biomarkers to improve risk stratification. A total of 228 patients with EP receiving conservative treatment were retrospectively included, with 169 classified as treatment success and 59 as failure. SR images were generated using a deep learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN). Radiomic features were extracted from both normal-resolution (NR) and SR ultrasound images. Features with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ≥ 0.75 were retained after intra- and inter-observer evaluation. Feature selection involved statistical testing and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Random forest algorithms were used to construct NR and SR models. A clinical model based on serum β-hCG was also developed. The Clin-SR model was constructed by fusing SR radiomics with β-hCG values. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). An independent temporal validation cohort (n = 40; 20 failures, 20 successes) was used to validation of the nomogram derived from the Clin-SR model. The SR model significantly outperformed the NR model in the test cohort (AUC: 0.791 ± 0.015 vs. 0.629 ± 0.083). In a representative iteration, the Clin-SR fusion model achieved an AUC of 0.870 ± 0.015, with good calibration and net clinical benefit, suggesting reliable performance in predicting conservative treatment failure. In the independent validation cohort, the nomogram demonstrated good generalizability with an AUC of 0.808 and consistent calibration across risk thresholds. Key contributing radiomic features included Gray Level Variance and Voxel Volume, reflecting lesion heterogeneity and size. The Clin-SR model, which integrates deep learning-enhanced SR ultrasound radiomics with serum β-hCG, offers a robust and non-invasive tool for predicting conservative treatment failure in ectopic pregnancy. This multimodal approach enhances early risk stratification and supports personalized clinical decision-making, potentially reducing overtreatment and emergency interventions."

    "abstract": "Ovarian pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy, accounting for approximately 3 % of cases, with an incidence ranging from 1 in 2100 to 1 in 7000 pregnancies. Its diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and difficulty distinguishing it from corpus luteum cysts or tubal pregnancies. Delayed recognition can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. A 34-year-old gravida 3 para 3 Japanese woman presented with acute abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock 33 days after her last menstrual period. Imaging revealed a right ovarian cystic mass, intra-abdominal bleeding, and an empty uterus. Emergency laparoscopy identified a 5-mm gestational sac-like lesion on the right ovary. Laparoscopic wedge resection was performed. Pathological analysis confirmed extravillous trophoblast invasion into ovarian stromal vessels. A corpus luteum was observed at a separate location, supporting the diagnosis of secondary extrafollicular ovarian pregnancy. The patient recovered uneventfully. Ovarian pregnancies are classified as primary or secondary, and intrafollicular or extrafollicular. This case demonstrated secondary extrafollicular implantation with vascular invasion. Updated diagnostic criteria emphasize intact fallopian tubes, hemorrhagic ovarian lesions, and pregnancy tissue identification. Early detection remains difficult, particularly before 5 weeks gestation, and diagnosis often requires surgical and pathological confirmation. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and laparoscopic management of ovarian pregnancy. Pathological findings aid in understanding implantation mechanisms and differentiating from similar adnexal conditions. Minimally invasive surgery enabled successful hemostasis and fertility preservation. Improved clinical awareness is essential to reduce complications associated with this rare condition."

This study evaluated the effectiveness of combined methotrexate injection (intra-gestational/systemic) for NTEP in an outpatient setting. In this case series (January 2019-December 2023), our institution introduced a program to treat NTEP using ultrasound-guided transvaginal intra-gestational methotrexate injection (100 mg) and intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg) with fetal intracardiac potassium chloride, if cardiac activity present. The primary outcome was the resolution of hCG levels without emergency surgery while secondary outcomes included safety, residual products of conception and future fertility. Twenty patients with NTEP (cesarean scar, n = 11; cervical, n = 5; interstitial, n = 4) were treated. The success rate was 95% (19/20), with one patient requiring emergency uterine artery embolization for acute hemorrhage one-month post-procedure, despite decreasing hCG. Acute hemorrhage occurred in 10% (2/20) of patients but resolved without hysterectomy. The median time to negative hCG was 80 days (IQR 51-112) with cesarean scar pregnancy taking longer to resolve (p = 0.047). Residual products of conception were observed in all patients who had follow up ultrasound (10/10). Of those who attempted to conceive afterward, 78% (7/9) achieved pregnancy within the study period. In conclusion, combined methotrexate for treatment of NTEP is a safe, effective, and fertility-sparing approach with promising future pregnancy outcomes. Complications warrant close surveillance until pregnancy resolution. Fertility clinics are well-suited to offer this non-surgical treatment in an outpatient setting."

    "abstract": "An abdominal pregnancy (AP) is a unique type of ectopic pregnancy that occurs when the embryo implants within the peritoneal cavity. It is an obstetrical emergency that can be fatal to both the mother and the fetus. Being able to identify such an occurrence in the emergency department requires physicians to understand certain risk factors and clinical findings and appreciate diagnostic challenges. This report discusses the case of a young female who presented with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding in what was believed to be an intrauterine pregnancy and later discovered to be an AP. It also highlights the differences in presentation of such cases as well as barriers that may impede diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies (EP) represent 2 % of pregnancies. Delayed diagnosis due to inadequate initial management of pregnancies of unknown location (PUL) is common. This study aimed to identify predictive factors for EP during the initial management of PULs, focusing on endometrial thickness (ET). A retrospective study (January 2020-March 2022) analyzed PUL patients at CHIPS Hospital. Clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound data, including ET and hCG ratio were analyzed. The hCG ratio was defined as the serum β-hCG level at 48 h divided by the baseline level. Logistic regression identified predictors of EP, and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Among 208 patients, 67 (32.2 %) were diagnosed with EP. ET was significantly thinner in the EP group compared to non-EPs (8.6 mm vs. 13.6 mm, p < 0.01). The hCG ratio differed between groups, with EPs showing a mean ratio of 1.28 compared to declining ratios in miscarriages (0.52) and increasing ratios in intrauterine pregnancies (2.19, p < 0.01). An ET threshold of <10 mm maximized diagnostic accuracy, yielding a sensitivity of 79 %, specificity of 70 %, and AUC of 0.80. Multivariate analysis identified ET <10 mm (OR = 13.17, 95 % CI: 5.59-31, p < 0.001) and hCG ratio (1-2) (OR = 35.37, 95 % CI: 7.12-175, p < 0.001) as independent predictors of EP. The final model achieved an AUC of 0.85. Endometrial thickness < 10 mm and an HCG ratio between 1 and 2 appear associated with EP in PUL patients. Integrating ET into diagnostic protocols could improve early detection and management, particularly in resource-limited settings. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and refine diagnostic algorithms."

    "abstract": "The coexistence of intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancies is termed heterotopic pregnancy (HP). Most reported cases of HP occur after assisted reproductive technology, and HP in a natural pregnancy (NP) is very rare, often discovered intraoperatively. HP is a significant challenge for obstetricians, gynecologists, and sonographers. A 30-year-old nulliparous woman presented to the emergency department of a local tertiary hospital on day 66 of amenorrhea with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting without an obvious cause. Transabdominal gynecological ultrasonography revealed coexisting left ectopic pregnancy (EP) and intrauterine pregnancy (IP) in the NP, both with measurable fetal heart activity. In addition, abdominal fluid and extensive pelvic hematoma were observed. Given a ruptured EP with hemorrhage, the obstetrician-gynecologist performed an emergency surgery, finding approximately 500 mL of blood and blood clots in the abdominal and pelvic cavities. The left tubal ampullary segment was dilated and thickened, with a visible rupture and active bleeding. Therefore, the left fallopian tube was resected, and IP was managed with therapy. The patient recovered well postoperatively and delivered a male infant by cesarean section at full term. The presence of IP does not exclude the coexistence of EP, even in NP. Although HP is rare and the symptoms of EP may not be obvious, sometimes masked by IP, obstetricians, gynecologists, and sonographers must remain vigilant in this regard to reduce the rate of missed diagnoses, provide early intervention, and safeguard the health of the pregnant woman and fetus."

    "abstract": "First-trimester pregnancy complications are common in the emergency department, with ectopic pregnancy being the leading cause of maternal mortality in this period. Emergency physicians play a critical role in early diagnosis and management, with proficiency in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) being an essential skill. Even when comprehensive radiology ultrasound is also available, independent image review remains crucial to ensure that subtle findings are not missed in this timely diagnosis. We present two cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancy initially evaluated in community emergency departments. Both cases involved lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and positive pregnancy tests. In each instance, transabdominal POCUS performed during initial evaluation identified concerning findings, including adnexal masses with complex echogenicity and pelvic free fluid. Despite comprehensive radiology ultrasound interpretations not confirming ectopic pregnancy, the emergency physician's reassessment of imaging raised concern for rupture, prompting urgent gynecologic intervention. Surgical exploration confirmed ruptured ectopic pregnancy in both cases, requiring operative management. Both patients had favorable postoperative outcomes. Ectopic pregnancy remains a high-risk condition necessitating thorough evaluation. These cases highlight the crucial role of POCUS and independent ultrasound interpretation by emergency physicians in preventing diagnostic delays. Recognizing subtle imaging findings, especially in cases where radiology interpretations are inconclusive, is critical for timely intervention. Emergency physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and collaborate with gynecology and radiology colleagues to optimize patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency that reduces ovarian reserve in reproductive-aged women. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of metformin and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on ovarian reserve after ovarian torsion. Forty female Wistar-Albino rats were divided into five groups: control, torsion/detorsion (T), torsion/detorsion + metformin (TM), torsion/detorsion + HBOT (THBO), and torsion/detorsion + metformin + HBOT (TMHBO). Rats in the experimental groups underwent 2 h of unilateral ovarian torsion followed by detorsion. Metformin (50 mg/kg/day) and HBOT (100% oxygen at 2.4 atm for 2 h/day) were administered for 14 days post-detorsion. Serum AMH levels, tissue AMH expression, and ovarian follicle counts were evaluated. In the torsion group, ovarian histology was disrupted, follicle numbers decreased, TUNEL-positive cells increased, and both serum and tissue AMH levels were reduced. The TM, THBO, and TMHBO groups demonstrated improvements in follicle numbers, TUNEL-positive cells, and AMH levels compared to the torsion group. Among them, TMHBO exhibited the best numerical outcomes, but no significant superiority was observed among TM, THBO, and TMHBO groups. Both metformin and HBOT were effective in preserving ovarian reserve following ovarian torsion. These therapies may have potential as protective treatments in gynecological emergencies involving ovarian torsion. La torsión ovárica es una emergencia ginecológica que afecta la reserva ovárica en mujeres en edad reproductiva. Este estudio evaluó los efectos de la metformina y la terapia de oxígeno hiperbárico (TOH) en la reserva ovárica tras una torsión ovárica. Cuarenta ratas Wistar-Albino hembras se dividieron en cinco grupos: control, torsión/destorsión (T), torsión/destorsión + metformina (TM), torsión/destorsión + TOH (TTOH) y torsión/destorsión + metformina + TOH (TMTOH). Los grupos experimentales fueron sometidos a torsión ovárica unilateral durante 2 horas, seguida de destorsión. Se administraron metformina (50 mg/kg/día) y TOH (oxígeno al 100%, 2.4 atm, 2 h/día) durante 14 días. Se midieron los niveles séricos y tisulares de hormona antimulleriana y el recuento de folículos ováricos. En el grupo de torsión, la histología ovárica estaba alterada, el número de folículos disminuyó, las células TUNEL positivas aumentaron y los niveles de hormona antimulleriana se redujeron. TM, TTOH y TMTOH mejoraron estos parámetros en comparación con el grupo T. Aunque TMTOH mostró los mejores resultados numéricos, no se observó superioridad significativa entre los grupos tratados. La metformina y la TOH demostraron ser eficaces para preservar la reserva ovárica tras una torsión ovárica, lo que destaca su potencial terapéutico en estas emergencias ginecológicas."

    "abstract": "To highlight the unique clinical presentation of acute abdomen in granulosa cell tumor patients. In a multicenter cohort study of adult-type granulosa cell tumors, women presenting with an acute abdomen at diagnosis were identified (Brink, 2025). After informed consent, clinical data were retrieved from patient records and collected in a Castor EDC database. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the subgroup of women with acute abdomen with the remainder of the adult type granulosa cell tumor cohort. Twenty-six out of 208 (12.5%) patients had an acute abdomen as presenting symptom of an adult-type granulosa cell tumor. All patients underwent emergency abdominal surgery. In 16 (62%) patients, the tumor mass was found to be ruptured pre-operatively, and 7 (27%) patients had an ovarian torsion. Seventeen patients (65%) of this group developed recurrent disease. When compared with the rest of the adult-type granulosa cell tumor cohort, patients with an acute abdomen at diagnosis were younger, had significantly more perioperative blood loss, and more often developed a recurrence. Adult-type granulosa cell tumors present with an acute abdomen in over 10% of the cases. In case of an ovarian mass or hemoperitoneum in women with an acute abdomen, a granulosa cell tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Surgery can then be performed with a more oncological approach, striving to avoid spill and thus decrease the risk of recurrence."

Rupture is also uncommon, yet when it occurs, it can mimic appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy due to peritoneal irritation, often requiring emergency intervention. A 25-year-old woman presented with nausea, vomiting, and an enlarging abdominal lump. Ultrasonography revealed bilateral ovarian cystic masses with ground glass appearances and free subhepatic fluid. Due to worsening symptoms despite initial resuscitation, emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively, a ruptured right ovarian cyst (20 × 15 × 15 cm) with extensive adhesions to the posterior uterus, rectum, and right ovarian fossa was identified, along with a left ovarian endometriotic cyst (12 × 10 × 10 cm). The patient underwent right salpingo-oophorectomy, left cystectomy, and ureterolysis. Histopathology confirmed endometriotic cysts. Rapid surgical intervention is crucial in ruptured cysts to minimize adhesion formation and preserve fertility. Postoperatively, continuous hormonal therapy, such as oral progesterone or an intrauterine device, is recommended to decrease recurrence."

If not diagnosed and treated promptly, it can lead to an increase in maternal as well as foetal morbidity and mortality. In the majority of cases, small bowel obstruction is caused by adhesions from previous pelvic surgeries. We herein report a case of SBO in a 28-week pregnant woman, who had a previous history of laparotomy for ectopic pregnancy. She presented with severe epigastric pain and vomiting in the emergency department. On initial examination, the patient was clinically stable but with a distended abdomen. Abdominal ultrasound showed fluid-filled dilated small bowel loops, but was otherwise unremarkable. Conservative treatment was provided, and she was kept on nothing by mouth. Despite intravenous pain killers and antiemetics, the symptoms remained unsettled 72 hours after admission. A clinical suspicion of SBO was made, and an urgent MRI was carried out, suggesting small bowel obstruction. She underwent an immediate laparotomy. Intraoperatively, bands of omentum were found to be adherent to the distal ileum. The adhesions were resected, and the affected ileum showed no signs of ischaemia, so it was preserved. Her postoperative course was uneventful. She later had a caesarean section for intrauterine growth restriction at 37 weeks and delivered a 2.1 kg baby. Diagnosis of SBO is difficult, especially in the second and third trimesters, as the symptoms often are mistakenly attributed to the pregnancy itself. There is a reluctance in getting investigations such as a CT scan done due to the risk of exposure of the foetus to ionising radiation which can lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. MRI can safely be used in pregnancy as a modality to diagnose intestinal obstruction and to determine the aetiology. Once diagnosed, the optimal management mainly depends on the aetiology and the gestational age."

    "abstract": "Patients presenting with bleeding or pelvic pain in early pregnancy are commonly found to have pregnancies of unknown location (PUL), with no sonographic findings of intrauterine nor ectopic pregnancy. We aimed to explore healthcare experiences and needs of patients presenting with PUL. This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to explore healthcare experiences among patients with PUL. Patients were eligible if they had a PUL followed in an electronic health record tracking list; had an initial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level of > 5 mIU/mL; spoke English; and were 18 years or older. Quasi-inductive directed content analysis was performed using NVivo 13. We conducted 20 qualitative interviews from November 2023 to March 2024. Sixty percent (n = 12) of participants identified as non-Hispanic Black, all identified as cis-gendered women, and the mean age was 30.6 years. All participants were insured and most (65%) had public insurance. Analysis resulted in findings around three general domains of PUL healthcare experiences: provider communication, care environment and timely access to necessary services. Participants generally appreciated a resident-staffed phone line for discussing questions and results. They noted successes and gaps in provider communication of uncertain diagnoses, mental health resources, and optimization of care environment, perhaps in a dedicated pregnancy emergency care unit. In facing the diagnostic uncertainty of PUL, patients voiced needs for more direct communication, more timely care and support resources, and more targeted pregnancy-specific emergency care. Our findings reveal opportunities for improvement in provider training and healthcare organizational structuring to better meet patient needs."

Ovarian torsion/detorsion (T/D) can lead to severe complications, including infertility, if not promptly addressed. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of casticin (CAST) on ovarian and lung tissue injuries induced by a bilateral ovarian T/D model in rats. Experimental animals were randomly allocated into groups of sham, T/D, CAST 5 mg/kg, and CAST 10 mg/kg. Ovarian and lung tissues were subjected to biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical analyses. In the T/D group, markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, including myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), oxidative stress index (OSI), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and 8-hydroxy-2' deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), were significantly elevated (P<0.05). Conversely, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were notably decreased (P<0.05). CAST administration significantly attenuated tissue damage by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory markers while enhancing antioxidant defense (P<0.05). CAST demonstrated a therapeutic effect against ovarian and lung tissue damage induced by T/D, suggesting that it may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for treating ovarian T/D-related injuries. These findings underscore the potential of CAST in clinical settings, particularly as a novel intervention to mitigate complications associated with I/R injuries in gynecological emergencies."

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to determine the spectrum of diseases of surgical acute abdomen by ultrasonography and comparing the ultrasound diagnosis with the surgical diagnosis of acute abdominal conditions in a low-income resource setting. A prospective observational study was conducted on consecutive patients presenting with acute abdomen to the radiology department for abdominal ultrasonography. The ultrasound diagnosis was compared with the surgical diagnosis. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used for association, and Kappa statistics was used for interobserver agreement. Diagnostic performance markers included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy. The most common conditions included appendicitis (27.5%), bowel perforation (21.7%), and ectopic pregnancy (12.5%). Ultrasonography had an overall sensitivity of 80.8%, specificity of 99.1%, PPV of 89.0%, NPV of 98.3%, and diagnostic accuracy of 97.6%. Sensitivities of 69.7%, 88.5%, 100.0%, and specificities of 98.9%, 96.8%, 100.0% were seen for acute appendicitis, bowel perforation, and ectopic pregnancy, respectively. There was a significant relationship between ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of most of the acute abdominal conditions (P < 0.001) except for appendiceal abscess (P = 0.05). Ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of all the acute abdominal conditions showed beyond chance kappa (κ) interobserver agreement (0.20< κ ≤1.00). With skilled hands, there is high concordance between ultrasound and surgical diagnosis of acute abdomen. Ultrasonography should be part of the initial evaluation of patients with surgical acute abdomen in a setting where emergency abdominal computed tomography is not readily available, accessible, and affordable. Résumé Introduction:L’objectif de cette étude était de déterminer le spectre des pathologies de l’abdomen aigu chirurgical par échographie et de comparer le diagnostic échographique au diagnostic chirurgical des affections abdominales aiguës dans un contexte de ressources à faibles revenus.Matériel et méthodes:Une étude observationnelle prospective a été menée auprès de patients consécutifs se présentant au service de radiologie pour une échographie abdominale pour un abdomen aigu. Le diagnostic échographique a été comparé au diagnostic chirurgical. Les tests du Chi carré et exact de Fisher ont été utilisés pour la corrélation, et la statistique Kappa pour la concordance interobservateur. Les marqueurs de performance diagnostique comprenaient la sensibilité, la spécificité, la valeur prédictive positive (VPP), la valeur prédictive négative (VPN) et la précision diagnostique.Résultats:Les affections les plus fréquentes étaient l’appendicite (27,5 %), la perforation intestinale (21,7 %) et la grossesse extra-utérine (12,5 %). L’échographie avait une sensibilité globale de 80,8 %, une spécificité de 99,1 %, une VPP de 89 %, une VPN de 98,3 % et une précision diagnostique de 97,6 %. Des sensibilités de 69,7 %, 88,5 %, 100 %, et des spécificités de 98,9 %, 96,8 %, 100 %, ont été observées respectivement pour l’appendicite aiguë, la perforation intestinale et la grossesse extra-utérine. Il existait une corrélation significative entre l’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical pour la plupart des affections abdominales aiguës (P < 0,001), à l’exception de l’abcès appendiculaire (P = 0,05). L’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical de toutes les affections abdominales aiguës ont montré une concordance interobservateur kappa (κ) au-delà du hasard (0,20 < κ ≤ 1,00).Conclusion:Avec des mains expertes, il existe une forte concordance entre l’échographie et le diagnostic chirurgical de l’abdomen aigu.

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Although ectopic pregnancy has been extensively studied in terms of epidemiology, associated risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and treatment modalities, the data regarding its impact on the development of adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancy remain scarce and conflicting. We aim to evaluate the adverse perinatal outcomes of women with a history of ectopic pregnancy Methods: We used the Medline (1966-2024), Scopus (2004-2024), Clinicaltrials.gov (2008-2024), EMBASE (1980-2024), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL (1999-2024), and Google Scholar (2004-2024) databases in our primary search. All studies that evaluated the impact of prior of ectopic pregnancy on the perinatal outcomes of the subsequent pregnancy and reported rates of adverse perinatal outcomes were considered eligible for inclusion. Twelve peer-reviewed papers were considered for inclusion in our study. We enrolled a total of 2,162,731 women. Of those, 23,823 (1.1%) had a history of prior ectopic pregnancy. A total of 4 out of 12 studies provided the necessary data to be included in the metanalysis. Results: Women with a history of treated ectopic pregnancy, either medically or surgically, demonstrated increased risk of developing placental abruption, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and preterm birth. History of ectopic pregnancy was also positively associated with low birth weight, subsequent ectopic pregnancy, and increased risk of a subsequent emergency cesarean section. Conclusions: The meta-analysis reveals evidence that ectopic pregnancy is positively associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in subsequent pregnancy. Our findings should be considered preliminary and serve as a basis for future research as the retrieved data are scarce and cannot be deemed sufficient."

    "abstract": "Ovarian transposition (OT) is performed to preserve ovarian function in patients undergoing pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy. Although complications, such as ovarian torsion and cyst formation, have been reported, ovulation-related peritoneal irritation requiring surgical intervention after pediatric OT has not been documented. In this case, a 12-year-old girl who underwent bilateral OT at the age of 6 years during treatment for recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma presented with severe pain in the right lower quadrant. Owing to prior pelvic radiotherapy, the assessment of menstrual history was unreliable. Considering the young age of the patient and the absence of a definitive diagnosis, hormonal therapy, such as low-dose estrogen-progestin therapy, was withheld. Conservative management with analgesics was initiated; however, the pain persisted and progressively worsened. Emergent laparoscopic OT release was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, owing to the severity of pain. Intraoperative findings revealed corpus luteum in the retracted right ovary. Postoperatively, the patient's symptoms resolved immediately without recurrence. Ovulation-induced peritoneal irritation should be recognized as a potential postoperative complication following childhood OT. In adolescent patients with a history of pediatric OT and pelvic radiotherapy, ovulation-related complications should be carefully considered during the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain."

It could be considered a public health indicator in the developing world because ectopic pregnancy presents as an acute emergency and it is a life-threatening event, providing a picture of a health system's capacity to handle the diagnosis and management of emergencies. This study investigated the incidence, socio-demographic, and other risk factors associated with ectopic pregnancy among women in early pregnancy. This cross-sectional observational study enrolled 102 women with ectopic pregnancy from June 2023 to May 2024 in a tertiary health center. Participants were selected by consecutive sampling and baseline data were collected by using a predesigned and pretested structured questionnaire. All patients with ectopic pregnancy who met the criteria for inclusion were included. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy in this study was 1.3%. The majority of these women (57.8%) were between the ages of 20-30 years, (76.4%) were multigravida, (78.4%) were in lower socioeconomic class, (78.4%) were from rural areas, (30.39%) were from tribal population, and 81.4% were referred cases from peripheral hospitals. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was the most common (12.75%) and important risk factors among women followed by female sterilization failure (8.83%), (4.90%) had a history of tuberculosis. The study concluded that women of reproductive age with pelvic inflammatory disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy. Assessment of women at risk factors and modification will reduce incidence."

We present a case of a 34-year-old gravida 7 para 6 woman with progressive lower abdominal pain, initially suspected to have an ovarian ectopic pregnancy based on ultrasound findings. The patient presented with no vaginal bleeding or shoulder tip pain, and her last menstrual period was uncertain due to lactational amenorrhea. A transvaginal ultrasound confirmed an extrauterine pregnancy at 11+2 weeks, with serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (BhCG) levels measured at 58818 mIU/ml. During emergency laparoscopy, an abdominal ectopic pregnancy was identified, with placental attachment to the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube and omentum. A salpingectomy was performed while preserving the ovary. This case report highlights the challenges in diagnosing and managing abdominal ectopic pregnancy and emphasises the importance of considering ectopic pregnancy in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in women of reproductive age."

    "abstract": "Pediatric ovarian torsion is a rare but serious condition that requires prompt diagnosis to prevent ovarian damage. This study evaluated the predictive value and reliability of specific sonographic signs in diagnosing pediatric primary ovarian torsion and correlated these findings with surgical outcomes. This retrospective multicenter study analyzed ultrasound and surgical records from 103 girls aged 7-14 diagnosed with suspected ovarian torsion across three institutions from November 2021 to June 2024. Three senior radiologists independently reviewed ultrasound findings, and surgical records served as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance was calculated for each ultrasound sign, both individually and in combination. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the predictive value of these signs. The inter-reviewer agreement (IRA) among three radiologists was also evaluated using Fleiss kappa statistics. Ovarian torsion was confirmed in 87 out of 103 cases (84.5 %). The most predictive sonographic signs were ovarian enlargement (OR = 10.09, 95 %CI: 2.01-50.57, p < 0.005), abnormal ovarian position (OR = 8.65, 95 %CI: 1.89-39.52, p < 0.005), and abnormal blood flow (OR = 5.61, 95 %CI: 1.12-28.17, p = 0.036). Ovarian enlargement had the highest sensitivity (92 %), while follicular ring sign showed perfect specificity (100 %). The combination of abnormal ovarian position and enlargement yielded a high positive predictive value (98.6 %). The IRA was excellent for ovarian enlargement (κ = 0.90) and abnormal position (κ = 0.85). Ovarian enlargement, abnormal ovarian position, and abnormal blood flow are reliable predictors of pediatric ovarian torsion on ultrasound. Combining these signs improves diagnostic accuracy and can guide timely surgical intervention."

The data of 70 patients with confirmed ovarian torsion followed and treated in our clinic for ovarian torsion and 73 patients for control group that presented to the emergency department with similar complaints but didn't have ovarian torsion detected on ultrasound as the control group between 2013 and 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Sonographic findings, laboratory values, and clinical status of patients were examined and fed into three supervised ML systems to identify and develop viable decision algorithms. Presence of nausea/vomiting and symptom duration were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for ovarian torsion. Presence of abdominal pain and palpable mass on physical examination weren't significant (p > 0.05). White blood cell count (WBC), neutrophile/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), high values of C-reactive protein was highly significant in prediction of torsion (p < 0.001, p < 0.05). Ovarian size ratio, medialization, follicular ring sign, presence of free fluid in pelvis in ultrasound demonstrated statistical significance in the torsion group (p < 0.001). We used supervised ML algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and LightGBM, to classify patients as either control or having torsion. We evaluated the models using 5-fold cross-validation, achieving an average F1-score of 98 %, an accuracy of 98 %, and a specificity of 100 % across each fold with the decision tree model. This study represents the first development of a ML algorithm that integrates clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic findings for the diagnosis of pediatric ovarian torsion with over 98 % accuracy."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is a rare but serious condition in pregnancy, posing significant risks to both maternal and fetal health. Its diagnosis and management are particularly challenging due to non-specific symptoms, limitations in radiological assessment during pregnancy, and the potential for surgical complications. The differentiation between obstetric and non-obstetric causes of an acute abdomen also poses a diagnostic challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports one of the rarest cases of intestinal obstruction in the first trimester of pregnancy. The case was initially mistaken for an ectopic pregnancy. The condition was successfully managed surgically without the need for pregnancy termination. A 34-year-old G3P2L2 woman from Northern Tanzania presented at 12 weeks gestation with sudden-onset abdominal pain. Initial radiological findings suggested a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with extensive hemoperitoneum. The patient was taken for an emergency laparotomy where an intrauterine pregnancy was identified as well as gangrenous small bowel and sigmoid colon due to a 360-degree mesenteric rotation. Surgical intervention included bowel resection, decompression, and anastomosis of the remaining segments. The mesenteric defects were closed, and the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery, being discharged in stable condition for conservative management. This case report highlights the rarity of intestinal obstruction during pregnancy and the diagnostic challenges it presents. Our case is particularly unique due to the absence of previous abdominal surgery and presentation so early in gestation. There exists significant diagnostic uncertainty and resulting delays in treatment have the potential to increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity, especially in resource poor settings. Intestinal obstruction during pregnancy is an uncommon but serious condition associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity. Its diagnosis can be challenging, as symptoms may mimic common obstetric complications, leading to potential delays in recognition and treatment. Effective management requires a multidisciplinary approach and timely clinical decision-making to optimize outcomes for both the mother and fetus."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency that occurs when the ovary gets twisted on its supporting ligaments, which then cuts off the blood supply to the ovary, causing ischemia. This commonly leads to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Having a history of ovarian cysts can increase the risk of ovarian torsion. In this case report, we will discuss a 22-year-old woman with a history of bilateral ovarian cysts who was diagnosed with gangrenous ovarian torsion. This study will highlight the importance of treating ovarian torsion in a timely fashion in order to prevent undesirable complications, such as gangrene of the ovary, as seen in our patient's case. Gangrene and other necrotic processes can occur from ovarian torsion due to twisting of the ovary, thus causing a lack of blood supply, which is considered a gynecologic emergency. Once the ovary becomes gangrenous, it is no longer considered viable and treatment options can become limited, as surgical removal is almost always required. Additionally, important topics need to be addressed, such as epidemiology, pathology, and infertility. This is clinically relevant because it raises awareness to diagnose and treat ovarian torsions in a timely manner, to prevent unwanted outcomes, such as gangrenous ovaries or future infertility issues."

    "abstract": "To identify clinical, sonographic, and laboratory characteristics that distinguish between tubal rupture and tubal abortion following methotrexate (MTX) treatment for ectopic pregnancy (EP) and to compare the morbidity associated with these 2 outcomes. This retrospective cohort study included women treated with MTX for EP at Galilee Medical Center between 2012 and 2024. Data on clinical presentation, ultrasound findings, and laboratory values were analyzed. Uregint surgical interventions were classified as tubal rupture or tubal abortion based on intraoperative findings. A comparative analysis between these groups was performed, and multivariable modeling was used to identify predictors of tubal rupture. Among 280 women treated with MTX, 47 (16.7%) required urgent surgical intervention. Of these, 15 (34.9%) were confirmed as tubal rupture, while 28 (65.1%) were tubal abortion. Women with tubal rupture more frequently presented with free pelvic fluid on transvaginal ultrasound (64.3 vs. 28.6%, P = 0.045) and had significantly higher intraoperative blood loss (433 ± 143 mL vs. 250 ± 201 mL, P = 0.001). A multivariable logistic regression model identified free pelvic fluid as an independent predictor of tubal rupture (odds ratio: 6.09, 95% CI 1.23-30.09, P = 0.027). No significant differences in preoperative beta-hCG levels or other clinical symptoms were observed between the groups. Tubal rupture and tubal abortion share overlapping clinical features, making differentiation with current diagnostic tools challenging. Free pelvic fluid on ultrasound is a significant indicator of tubal rupture, underscoring the importance of timely surgical intervention. Recognizing that tubal abortion may be a self-limiting condition in some cases offers opportunities to preserve fallopian tube integrity and reduce unnecessary surgeries. Further research is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy and explore conservative management strategies for tubal abortion. Date and number of trial registration: December 2024, 0138-24-NHR."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. Treatment options include either medical management with methotrexate or surgical management. There are several risks associated with methotrexate therapy. However, chronic pelvic pain is typically not a risk cited. The case presented is a 27-year-old Hispanic woman, gravida two, para zero with chronic pelvic pain and a history of left tubal ectopic pregnancy successfully treated with methotrexate. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated a hemorrhagic structure adjacent to the left ovary suspicious for residual ectopic pregnancy tissue. After a period of conservative management, the patient elected for surgical management via laparoscopic left salpingectomy. Pathologic analysis of the specimen confirmed a hyalinized nodule with chronic inflammation, suggestive of remote treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Post-operatively, the patient's chronic pelvic pain completely resolved. Further research needs to be done on the incidence of chronic pelvic pain following methotrexate treatment for ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a rare gynecological emergency, particularly in postmenopausal women, and is associated with significant morbidity if not promptly managed. The occurrence of torsion in giant ovarian cysts (>20 cm) is exceptionally uncommon, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. A 67-year-old postmenopausal woman with stage IIIB cervical cancer presented with worsening abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding over three months. During surgery, a 30 cm giant right ovarian cyst with torsion and a smaller left dermoid cyst were identified. The patient underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and histopathological findings confirmed a right benign serous cystadenoma with mature teratoma and struma ovary and left serous cystadenoma and dermoid cyst. Postoperatively, she received chemoradiation for cervical cancer and remained asymptomatic at one-year follow-up. This case emphasizes the need for prompt diagnosis and management of ovarian torsion in postmenopausal women, especially in complex clinical scenarios involving coexisting conditions such as cervical cancer."

    "title": "Spontaneous Endometrioma Rupture: A Retrospective Pilot Study and Literature Review of a Rare and Challenging Condition.",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Endometriosis can present as ovarian endometriosis in 15-25% of the cases. While chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea dominate its clinical presentation, acute complications, such as spontaneous OMA rupture, are rare (<3%), often mimicking acute abdominal pain and necessitating emergency surgery. Diagnostic delays persist due to the condition's rarity and overlapping symptoms with ovarian torsion or appendicitis. This study investigates the clinical features of ruptured OMAs to enhance preoperative suspicion and optimize management. Methods: From February 2011 to August 2023, 14 patients with spontaneous rupture of histologically confirmed endometriomas underwent emergency laparoscopy for acute abdominal pain in the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland. The clinical data of these patients were analyzed to find common patterns of spontaneous endometrioma ruptures. We also conducted a literature search in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, and Embase databases from inception to December 2023 in order to identify other possible confounding factors. The search was based on the keywords \"ruptured endometrioma\". All English full-text prospective and retrospective observational and interventional studies with at least five patients that described the clinical features and findings of women diagnosed with ruptured endometrioma and treated surgically were included. Results: The median age at operation was 37.4 (23-49) years old, and all cases presented with acute abdominal pain, with/without peritonitis. Only 3/14 patients presented with fever, while the most common laboratory finding was an elevated CRP level of 45.6 mg/L (3-100 mg/L), while leukocytosis was less pronounced, with a median of 12.2 G/L (6.04-21.4 G/L). Notably, 64.3% (9 out of 14) of the patients reported experiencing dysmenorrhea, while for the remaining 5 individuals, the presence or absence of dysmenorrhea could not be obtained. Interestingly, only one patient had undergone hormonal treatment, with a combined oral contraceptive (COC) of Ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg) and Desogestrel (0.15 mg), while the other patients either lacked awareness of their endometriosis or expressed reluctance towards hormonal downregulation therapy. The median endometrioma size was 7 cm (3.5-18 cm), and 78.57% of the cases (11 out of 14 patients) had only ovarian endometriosis, while only 3 patients had involvement of compartment A, B, or C according to the # ENZIAN classification. Conclusions: Though rare, spontaneous OMA rupture should be considered in acute abdomen cases, especially with cysts > 5 cm. Hormonal therapy may reduce rupture risk, but more research is needed to confirm this and refine diagnostic strategies."

    "abstract": "Advanced abdominal pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy. It is rarely diagnosed especially in low-income countries and associated with very high fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The management of advanced abdominal pregnancy is based on surgical procedure. Laparotomy was chosen to be better than laparoscopic surgery because of the risk of perioperative haemorrhage, which can be uncontrollable from the implantation site. Uterine prolapse during pregnancy is rare. The etiology is multifactorial. We report this association to discuss difficulties in the management of these two pathologies in areas where health services are unavailable or utilized poorly. A 25-year-old woman was referred to our maternity ward for uterine prolapse and pregnancy. On examination, the cervix protruded and edematous beyond the introitus (Stade IV of the POP-Q classification). She had no prenatal consultation and no history of surgery or vaginal delivery complications. The obstetric ultrasound revealed an empty uterus and an abdominal pregnancy at 32 weeks and the placenta localization was unclear. An urgent laparotomy was performed, and we discovered the foetus in the abdominal cavity. The placenta was attached to the right ovary and large ligament. We successfully extracted the foetus and placenta. The newborn presented ectodactylia and club varus equinus. He developed respiratory distress after 12 h and died. Before her was discharged from the hospital, she requested sterilization and total hysterectomy was scheduled after 3 months. The association between advanced abdominal pregnancy and uterine prolapse is exceptional. This phenomenon can be observed in developing countries because of poor prenatal follow-up. Management is based on urgent laparotomy for abdominal pregnancy and hysterectomy for uterine prolapse for women who have completed their family's life."

    "abstract": "Acute pelvic pain (APP) is a common presentation in women of all ages and has both gynaecological and non-gynaecological causes. In the emergency department, the suspected differential diagnosis dictates the chosen imaging modality. For premenopausal patients with APP, transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) are first-line investigations with high sensitivity and specificity for ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion, and ovarian cysts and their complications. US may also be valuable in pelvic inflammatory disease. When a non-gynaecological cause is suspected, contrast-enhanced CT (± transabdominal US) is indicated and has the advantage of 24/7 availability and lack of operator dependence. CT, however, may reveal an unexpected gynaecological cause of APP. When available, MRI is an excellent second test to improve diagnostic certainty in pregnant women when US is inconclusive-both for gynaecological and non-gynaecological conditions. MRI has a high diagnostic accuracy for pelvic inflammatory disease and tubo-ovarian abscesses. This article will enable readers to refresh their knowledge of common causes of APP and understand the histopathological processes involved in gynaecological causes of APP and how the imaging findings correlate. It will outline why different modalities are useful in different pathologies and help understand the limitations of each modality, including the requirement for operator expertise (US), relative lack of specificity/sensitivity (CT), and limited availability (MRI). This article excludes pregnancy-related causes of APP (apart from ectopic pregnancy) and also excludes non-gynaecological causes of APP. KEY POINTS: In female patients with acute pelvic pain, ultrasound is the best first modality in suspected gynaecological pathology. CT can be used when non-gynaecological causes of pain are suspected and when US is inconclusive. MRI has limited availability in an emergency setting and may be used in pelvic inflammatory disease and in pregnancy when US is inconclusive."

    "abstract": "Adnexal torsion is a gynecological emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention to prevent irreversible ovarian damage. This case report presents a 19-year-old female with a history of spina bifida, neurogenic bladder managed by enterocystoplasty, and chronic urinary retention, who presented with fluctuating pelvic and lumbar pain. Initial ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis without obstruction, while subsequent imaging revealed a pelvic mass with features concerning for ovarian torsion. A non-contrast MRI confirmed a hemorrhagic, non-viable ovary with peripheral microfollicules and a twisted vascular pedicle, establishing the diagnosis of adnexal torsion with infarction. Laparoscopic surgery confirmed the torsion, necessitating oophorectomy due to irreversible ischemic damage. This case underscores the diagnostic challenges posed by atypical presentations, particularly in patients with pre-existing urological conditions. The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, endometriomas, ectopic pregnancy, and tubo-ovarian abscess, which can mimic torsion. Imaging plays a crucial role in differentiating these conditions and assessing ovarian viability. This report highlights the importance of a structured diagnostic approach, integrating ultrasound, CT, and MRI to optimize timely intervention and preserve ovarian function whenever possible. Radiologists should maintain a high index of suspicion in atypical cases to avoid delays in management and improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute abdominopelvic pain during pregnancy and the postpartum period is a diagnostic challenge owing to the overlapping symptoms of obstetric, gastrointestinal, and urinary conditions coupled with pregnancy-induced physiological changes. This pictorial essay reviews critical obstetric emergencies and categorizes cases into two phases: the first covers the preconception-to-pregnancy period, while the second focuses on the postpartum period. This essay covers key obstetric emergencies, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, hyperreactio luteinalis, ectopic pregnancy, red degeneration of fibroids, placenta accreta spectrum disorders, placental abruption, uterine rupture, retained products of conception, and uterine arteriovenous malformations, with an emphasis on their clinical and imaging characteristics. While ultrasound remains the first-line modality, MRI offers superior soft tissue contrast for more complex cases, and CT is reserved for critical scenarios in which the radiation risk is outweighed by diagnostic necessity. Timely and accurate imaging is essential for differentiating these conditions, guiding interventions, such as uterine arterial embolization and surgery, and minimizing maternal and fetal morbidity. This work aims to enhance the diagnostic precision and multidisciplinary management of obstetric emergencies, ensuring optimal clinical outcomes."

Caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy is one of the very rare sites of ectopic pregnancy. Any type of surgical scar on the uterine wall (hysterotomy) including caesarean section, myomectomy or history of abnormally adherent placenta or manual removal of placenta increases the risk of surgical scar ectopic pregnancy. Here, we have described a case of caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy in a 43 years female presenting to the emergency department after being referred from a primary centre with complaints of pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis of caesarean section scar ectopic pregnancy. The patient was successfully managed with multi dose regime of methotrexate.

Here, we report the case of a patient with CRC who developed torsion of ovarian metastases and underwent abdominal adnexectomy following chemotherapy with bevacizumab. A 51-year-old premenopausal woman presented with abdominal distension and was referred to our hospital after ultrasonography revealed abdominal tumors. Imaging showed bilateral ovarian masses (maximum diameters: right, 10 cm; left, 14 cm), subserosal leiomyomas, and a circumferential sigmoid colon tumor with peritoneal nodules and ascites. A colonoscopy confirmed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed with stage IV sigmoid colon cancer, including ovarian metastasis, peritoneal metastases, and pleural effusion. The patient began chemotherapy with tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil potassium, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab, resulting in a decrease in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels, though carcinoembryonic antigen levels increased. After the fourth chemotherapy cycle, the patient experienced sudden left-sided abdominal pain accompanied by nausea. Computed tomography revealed torsion of the left ovarian tumor (maximum diameter: 19 cm) with suspected hemorrhage. A drop in hemoglobin levels required a blood transfusion. Emergency laparotomy revealed a three-turn torsion of the left ovarian pedicle and an intra-tumoral hemorrhage. A bilateral adnexectomy was performed, and ovarian metastases from colon cancer were confirmed pathologically. Despite bevacizumab treatment, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on day 12. Chemotherapy was resumed. In patients with metastatic ovarian tumors who present with sudden abdominal pain, ovarian torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis, even in the context of malignancy."

    "abstract": "Perinatal bereavement can severely disrupt women's anticipated role as mothers, affecting their psychological wellbeing and identity as parents. Existing research highlights many women report persistent and enduring grief for months or even years post-loss, highlighting the urgent need for interventions to help maintain a healthy parental identity and mitigate long-term mental health impacts. To explore how memory-making practices, supported by compassionate care, serve to preserve the parental identity of bereaved mothers after perinatal loss. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 54 UK-based women who had experienced a perinatal bereavement. Grounded Theory Analysis guided the inductive coding and thematic development. Five themes emerged: (1) Compassion to Care; (2) Finding Comfort in Guidance; (3) Deriving Hope from Parental Identity; (4) Altruism as Catharsis; and (5) Comforted and Consoled. Together, these themes gave rise to the final theory, 'From Mourning to Memorialising - A Lasting Connection through Remembrance,' demonstrating how memory-making enables bereaved mothers to preserve their sense of parenthood after loss. Memory-making activities allow bereaved mothers to acknowledge their baby's existence and uphold their parental identity. When supported by compassionate care and support, these activities help to integrate the baby's memory into daily life, gradually easing acute grief. Over time, they become lasting markers which validate motherhood, foster continuity, and provide solace, ensuring that parenthood endures despite the absence of a living child. Structured memory-making and compassionate care strategies can enhance parental identity retention, fostering emotional resilience and guiding more effective bereavement care provision."

The objective of this study was to describe our initial experience with aspiration of acutely torted adnexal cysts. This was a retrospective single-center study, in which we identified all patients who underwent ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration in our center between February 2008 and September 2023. Indications for the procedure were ultrasound diagnosis of adnexal torsion due to an ovarian cyst and clinical symptoms of acute adnexal torsion. Success was defined as the avoidance of emergency surgery for adnexal torsion related to the same cyst. We extracted clinical data, ultrasound scan findings, procedural details and clinical outcomes from our clinical database. Overall, 46 patients underwent ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration for the management of adnexal torsion, 24 (52%) of whom were pregnant. At ultrasound examination, all 46 cysts had unilocular morphology, and in 96% (44/46) of cases, the cyst content was anechoic. Cyst aspiration was performed transabdominally in 30 (65%) patients and transvaginally in 16 (35%) patients. A total of 39 (85%) patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms immediately after ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration. One procedure was abandoned owing to patient discomfort and six (13%) patients reported non-resolution or short-term recurrence of symptoms, necessitating emergency laparoscopy in seven patients. No complications occurred as a result of ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration. Three patients had cyst aspiration more than once. Follow-up data were available for 29/39 (74%) patients who had successful ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration and received a subsequent ultrasound assessment in our clinic. In 8/29 (28%) patients, the cyst had completely resolved. In total, 4/21 (19%) patients with a persistent cyst opted for elective surgical intervention, while 17/21 (81%) continued conservative management at the last follow-up. Overall, 25/29 (86%) of those followed up after successful ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration, and at least 25/46 (54%) of all patients, avoided any form of surgical treatment. Ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration is an effective treatment for the management of acute adnexal torsion due to a cyst with unilocular morphology and anechoic or hypoechoic fluid content. With the use of this technique, emergency hospital admission and surgery were avoided in the majority of patients. © 2025 The Author(s).

Adnexal torsion is a rare emergency in pregnancy), often linked to ovarian pathology like dermoid cysts, as in our cases. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and anatomical changes during pregnancy, with ultrasound as the primary tool and MRI for additional precision. Management depends on gestational age and adnexal viability, with laparoscopy favored before 17 weeks and laparotomy for advanced pregnancies. Adnexal torsion is difficult to diagnose in pregnancy due to nonspecific symptoms. Prompt diagnostic laparoscopy, following safety guidelines, is crucial for persistent pain unresponsive to treatment to avoid delays."

This review addresses the diagnostic challenges, imaging patterns, and management strategies for both ovarian and testicular torsion, including a brief discussion on the emerging role of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS), therefore filling a significant gap in the literature. We emphasize the need for a high index of suspicion due to often nonspecific clinical presentations, particularly in ovarian torsion. An accurate and swift diagnosis allows conservative surgical intervention to be offered, which is crucial to maximize gonadal salvage and minimize recurrence. While we highlight CEUS's potential benefits in enhancing diagnostic clarity without ionizing radiation, ultrasound and other modalities such as MRI and CT, have a paramount role in this setting. Future research comparing CEUS with MRI is essential to validate its diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness, potentially revolutionizing acute care diagnostics. Incorporating CEUS into diagnostic workflows, along with a deep understanding of the condition's epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation, may probably significantly improve patient outcomes. We detail the characteristic imaging features, diagnostic pitfalls, and differential diagnoses essential for radiologists, with particular relevance for residents and those with limited pediatric radiology exposure. This review aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps and serve as a robust educational tool, facilitating better clinical decision-making and outcomes in pediatric gonadal torsion cases."

Data collected included patient history, symptomatology, biological and imaging assessment at first episode, emergency surgery, follow-up including recurrence. Thirty centers participated and we included 502 girls diagnosed with ovarian torsion during a surgical procedure performed due to abdominal pain (with or without ovarian mass). The girls had a mean age of 7.9 years (±2.8) and a median age of 8.3 years (Q1 5.97; Q3 10.12) at the time of the first episode of torsion. Nausea or vomiting was present in 71 % of cases.

Its diagnosis is frequently challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and reliance on ultrasound findings that may not always indicate abnormalities. Case reports for this type of pregnancy are limited due to its low incidence. We present a case of a 38-year-old patient from southern urban Mexico, undergoing her 3rd pregnancy. Around the due date, she was admitted to the obstetric emergency department, presenting with stabbing pain in the right lower extremity at the level of the thigh with perception of fetal movements and contracture of the right pelvic limb. After five hours without labor, an emergency cesarean section was performed. During intervention, the uterus (12 x 8 x 6 cm) was observed with the presence of a subserosa fibroid in the uterine fundus (1 cm), amniotic sac located in the abdominal cavity with normal amniotic fluid, and placenta with insertion in the posterior fundus, posterior aspect of the uterus and part of the sigmoid, with extension to the right broad ligament and distortion of the anatomy of the right appendix, which was removed with the help of surgery without complications. We reported a rare case of ectopic pregnancy, which remained unexpected until cesarean section, due to a single ultrasound report indicating uneventful pregnancy and a healthy fetus. We conclude that an ectopic pregnancy can progress almost uneventfully and result in a neonate without anomalies."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy, the simultaneous occurrence of intrauterine and extrauterine gestations, is a rare phenomenon, especially without a history of assisted reproduction. This case report describes a 33-year-old woman presenting with severe abdominal pain at 7 weeks of pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an intrauterine singleton pregnancy and an adnexal mass, highly suspicious of an ectopic pregnancy, along with significant intraperitoneal fluid. Emergency laparoscopy confirmed intra-abdominal hemorrhage and a near rupture of the left fallopian tube. A laparoscopic salpingotomy successfully resolved the ectopic pregnancy while preserving the intrauterine pregnancy. Postoperative course was uneventful. The patient later delivered a healthy infant at term. This case highlights the importance of considering heterotopic pregnancy in patients with confirmed intrauterine pregnancy, even in the absence of assisted reproductive technologies and other risk factors."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is where a pregnancy develops in an abnormal location. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy in Ireland is approximately 14.8 per 1,000 maternities. Most occur within the fallopian tube and untreated may result in serious morbidity with complications including blood transfusion, visceral injury at surgery and death. Ectopic pregnancy remains the leading cause of death worldwide in the first trimester of pregnancy. We aimed to examine the diagnosis and management of tubal ectopic pregnancy in a large tertiary maternity hospital. This was a retrospective review of individuals treated for tubal ectopic pregnancy from 2017 to 2022. Records were identified from local databases. Anonymised data on risk-factors, symptoms and management was collected. Data were transcribed from electronic healthcare records and descriptive analyses performed. Of the 471 records identified; 20 were excluded as they were non-tubal ectopic pregnancies. Primary management employed was conservative (99/451, 22 %), medical (113/451, 25 %) and surgical (239/451, 53 %). Surgery was performed in 62.7 % (283/451) cases, including those who started in one treatment pathway but changed to surgical management. Most surgeries were performed in a co-located general hospital theatre (89.3 %), with 54.4 % undertaken out-of-hours. Laparoscopy was the commonest surgical approach (96.4 %) and salpingectomy the most prevalent procedure (99.3 %). Emergency surgical intervention, due to haemodynamic instability and/or suspected rupture, was required in 21.9% (62/283). Only 11.7% (33/283) of those managed surgically experienced adverse outcomes, with blood transfusion and high dependency unit admission the most common. A small proportion (10%) of individuals were provided with pregnancy loss information (including resources and support services available), highlighting the importance of recognising ectopic pregnancy as a pregnancy loss and not just a gynaecological emergency. In this large series, most tubal ectopic pregnancies had surgical laparoscopic management, but this was outside normal working hours and in a co-located general hospital. Management of tubal ectopic pregnancy was safe with minimal adverse outcomes."

    "title": "An Unusual Presentation of Subcutaneous Inguinal Hematoma Mimicking Ovarian Torsion: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian or adnexal torsions occur when an ovary rotates around one of the supporting ligaments, often the infundibulopelvic (IP) ligament. This rotation can cause the blood flow to the ovary to be hindered, and this decrease in perfusion can often present as adnexal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A significant risk factor for developing an ovarian torsion is the presence of an ovarian mass, such as a cyst. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion is a medical emergency, but symptoms typically resolve with prompt surgical intervention. Hematomas occurring within or around the inguinal region have been reported to occur primarily after procedures such as ablations or inguinal hernia repairs. These hematomas commonly present post-operatively and are not typical features in the setting of adnexal torsion. We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented with severe, acute-onset pelvic pain and prominent bruising on her left groin area following intercourse. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed the presence of a left ovarian cyst and lack of arterial blood flow to the left ovary, indicating the possibility of a left ovarian torsion. The patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with left oophorectomy. However, during the procedure an aberrant vessel was identified that branched from the left IP ligament, running through the inguinal canal, and terminated at the anterior abdominal wall. The vessel was ligated intraoperatively, and the patient ultimately recovered without complications. At the time of post-operative evaluation, the patient was without any recurring symptoms. This case report identifies an unusual presentation of symptoms mimicking ovarian torsion with accompanying ipsilateral subcutaneous inguinal hematoma secondary to aberrant pelvic vasculature. Our patient had an unusual presentation of pelvic pain mimicking ovarian torsion with accompanying ipsilateral subcutaneous inguinal hematoma secondary to aberrant pelvic vasculature. According to our recent literature searches, there is no available clinical information regarding this combination presentation. The goal of this report is to provide insight into diagnosis and treatment for patients with this atypical presentation."

    "abstract": "This case report highlights the challenges of managing laryngospasm during emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Laryngospasm, a serious complication of anesthesia, causes involuntary laryngeal muscle contractions that obstruct the airway and can lead to hypoxemia, unconsciousness, or death if untreated. A 39-year-old obese woman presented with acute abdominal pain and symptoms of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. During anesthesia induction, she experienced laryngospasm, complicating intubation and requiring the use of a laryngeal mask airway. Treatment with subcutaneous epinephrine, nebulized morphine, and aminophylline successfully restored her airway, allowing the surgery to proceed without further complications. This case emphasizes the importance of being prepared to manage laryngospasm, particularly in high-risk patients with factors like obesity, emotional stress, or a history of asthma. It highlights the need for anesthesiologists to remain vigilant and respond swiftly to early signs of airway obstruction. The report underscores the value of teamwork and timely intervention in managing emergencies to ensure patient safety and prevent life-threatening outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially severe complication of ovulation induction. Although less common than with gonadotropin treatment, OHSS can occur secondary to an excessive dose of clomiphene citrate, a first-line ovulation induction agent. A serious complication of OHSS is ovarian torsion, which demands prompt diagnosis and intervention to prevent permanent damage. This case report highlights a rare case of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) with subsequent ovarian torsion following clomiphene citrate treatment. A 24-year-old woman with primary infertility developed severe OHSS after receiving clomiphene citrate (100 mg twice daily, D2-D16). Her initial symptoms included vomiting and severe abdominal pain. Ultrasound examination revealed an enlarged left ovary (100x65x60mm) with multiple follicles and pelvic effusion. Despite initial conservative management, the patient returned four days post-discharge with worsening symptoms. Emergency laparoscopy revealed vascular congestion of the left ovary and successful detorsion restored normal blood flow. this case illustrates severe OHSS complicated by ovarian torsion secondary to an excessive dose of clomiphene citrate. The patient's initial presentation and ultrasound findings were indicative of OHSS, and despite conservative management, progression to ovarian torsion required surgical intervention. The successful detorsion and restoration of blood flow underscore the importance of timely surgical management to prevent irreversible damage, regardless of the ovulation induction agent used. Although clomiphene citrate is generally considered safer than gonadotropins for ovulation induction, it can still induce severe OHSS leading to complications such as ovarian torsion particularly if given in overdosage. This case emphasizes the critical need for vigilant monitoring and prompt surgical intervention in OHSS cases to preserve ovarian function, regardless of the ovulation induction agent used."

This unique case demonstrates the limitations of pelvic imaging and patient history. A 32-year-old woman with a history of unilateral oophorectomy, presented to the emergency department with worsening left lower abdominal pain concerning for ovarian torsion. A pelvic ultrasound showed an 8-cm heterogeneous right ovarian cyst with preserved arterial flow. The left ovary appeared absent. The endometrium appeared irregular with scant anechoic intracavitary fluid. She underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, revealing large bilateral ovarian masses, each with torsion along its infundibulopelvic ligament. Concurrent hysteroscopic sampling demonstrated endometrial adenocarcinoma. This unique case of simultaneous bilateral ovarian torsion with synchronous endometrial adenocarcinoma emphasizes the vigilance required to pursue a diagnosis when a clinical presentation conflicts with reported patient history and imaging findings."

    "abstract": "To estimate the effect of Medicaid expansion on uninsurance rates and catastrophic charges from emergency surgical management of ectopic pregnancy and ovarian torsion using difference-in-difference analysis and to evaluate for racial and ethnic disparities. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using 2012-2018 State Inpatient Data and State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases in four states: Kentucky and Maryland (expansion) and Florida and North Carolina (nonexpansion). Patients undergoing surgical management of ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy were included. Logistic regression models were used controlling for year and expansion type; a difference-in-difference treatment indicator was used to evaluate changes in uninsurance rates and catastrophic spending (hospital charges more than 10% of estimated annual median income) among those uninsured. We then examined race and ethnicity for those uninsured before and after expansion by state. A total of 594,116 patients were included. Before expansion, the percent of patients uninsured was higher in nonexpansion states (6.5%) compared with expansion states (5.1%). After expansion, the percent uninsured decreased from 5.1% to 2.4% in expansion states compared with 6.5% to 5.3% in nonexpansion states. The interaction between expansion year and Medicaid expansion status was significant ( P <.001). Pre-expansion percent catastrophic charges among uninsured patients were higher in nonexpansion states compared with expansion states (96.7% vs 85.7%). After expansion, the percent catastrophic financial burden remained higher at 96.9% in nonexpansion states compared with 82.5% in expansion states. The interaction between expansion year and Medicaid expansion status was significant ( P <.001). The uninsured gap between Black or African American and White patients in expansion states after expansion was 0.5%-relatively unchanged-compared with 11.6% for Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients, an increase from 8.3% before expansion. Medicaid expansion was associated with reductions in uninsured hospitalizations and catastrophic charges after gynecologic surgical emergencies and was associated with differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients."

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a major cause of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide, with significant implications for reproductive health. The bacterium's genome contains highly polymorphic regions, influencing both the type and severity of infections. These genetic variations, particularly those occurring in the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) gene, are critical for classifying the bacterium into distinct serovars and enable CT to adapt to diverse host environments, contributing to its immune evasion, persistence, and pathogenicity. Persistent or untreated urogenital infections can lead to chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and pelvic inflammatory disease, ultimately increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and infertility. This review consolidates current knowledge on the genetic diversity of CT, its potential role in modulating infection outcomes, and its immune evasion mechanisms. By integrating scientific evidence linking chlamydial infections to infertility, we underscore the urgent need for targeted research to address this critical public health challenge."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis and adnexal torsion associated with ovarian tumors are possible causes of acute abdomen in women, yet differentiation remains challenging. Once adnexal torsion is suspected in young women, gynecologists should perform surgery to release the torsion as promptly as possible to preserve future fertility. Herein, we report a case of acute appendicitis that was unexpectedly discovered during laparoscopic surgery initially performed for suspected torsion of a right ovarian teratoma. A 20-year-old nulligravid woman with a history of left ovarian teratoma resection and ulcerative colitis presented with left lower abdominal pain. Non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no findings suggestive of exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, such as bowel wall thickening or worsening ascites, while a mass suspected to be an ovarian teratoma was identified. Gynecologists and an emergency physician specializing in gastroenterology who attended the patient suspected an acute abdomen caused by adnexal torsion or tumor leakage associated with a right ovarian teratoma 5 cm across. However, laparoscopy revealed that the right ovarian teratoma was neither twisted nor ruptured. Instead, the appendix was swollen with yellow turbid ascites, compatible with acute appendicitis. Therefore, laparoscopic excision of the right ovarian teratoma and appendix was performed, and the patient's pain resolved postoperatively. The assumption that the pain was caused by torsion of the right ovarian teratoma was the primary reason for failing to diagnose acute appendicitis. This underscores the importance of evaluating the appendix during gynecologic laparoscopic surgery performed for suspected ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the demographic, ultrasonographic, and laboratory findings as well as the outcomes of patients with ectopic pregnancy (EP) who underwent life-saving urgent surgery. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Tersiyer Referral Hospital between January 01, 2016 and January 01, 2020. The study included 469 cases of EP. Data for these patients were extracted from hospital records and patient files. For the analysis of life-saving urgent surgeries, only patients presenting with severe signs and symptoms during hospital admission, follow-up, or after methotrexate (MTX) therapy were included. The mean age of the patients was 31.2 (+-5.65) years, with the youngest being 15 years old and the oldest 49 years old. A history of EP was noted in 15.1% of patients, and 29.4% were smokers. The reasons for consulting a doctor included no complaints in 37 patients (7.9%), delayed menstruation in 37 patients (7.9%), abdominal pain in 128 patients (27.3%), abdominal pain with vaginal bleeding in 108 patients (23.0%), and only vaginal bleeding in 159 patients (33.9%). In four patients (0.9%), the ectopic focus could not be identified via ultrasound, while in 255 patients (54.3%) the ectopic focus was located in the right adnexal area. The mean preoperative hemoglobin level was 12.4 (+-1.33) g/dL, with a median hemoglobin value of 12.6 (range: 7.2-14.7 ) g/dL. A comparison of demographic data, ultrasound findings, and pre- and postoperative laboratory results between patients who underwent surgery without MTX therapy and those who underwent surgery following MTX therapy revealed significant differences in terms of age, parity, maximum diameter of the ectopic focus, preoperative hemoglobin levels, preoperative white blood cell counts, presence of free fluid in the abdomen, and contraceptive methods. EP holds a significant place among gynecological emergencies. Any delay in diagnosis can lead to life-threatening conditions, where the only viable treatment at this stage is life-saving urgent surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy is an uncommon and possibly serious problem characterized by maternities at unique implantation sites, with only one occurring in the intrauterine cavity. Its incidence is approximately 1 in 30,000 natural pregnancies, posing significant threats to maternal health. The complexity of clinical and laboratory findings complicates its diagnosis, necessitating a high index of suspicion for prompt intervention. We reported the case of a 36-year-old woman diagnosed with heterotopic pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation following spontaneous conception, who presented with severe abdominal pain. Initial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels were 57,278.00 mIU/mL. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) revealed a single live fetus in the uterus, estimated at 12 weeks and six days, alongside a thick-walled cystic structure in the right ovary and an irregular hypoechoic mass inferior to the right ovary. An urgent laparoscopic salpingectomy was performed under general anesthesia, revealing a distended right fallopian tube (3.5 cm) with a thickened appearance, bluish-purple discoloration, and a 2 mm rupture with active bleeding surrounded by clots. Histopathological examination confirmed ectopic pregnancy. Postoperative β-HCG levels were 49,213 mIU/mL and 57,577 mIU/mL on the second and third days, respectively. Clinicians should maintain vigilance for heterotopic pregnancy, especially in the absence of infertility treatments or known risk factors. Lower quadrant abdominal or pelvic pain should prompt consideration of heterotopic pregnancy, as the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy does not exclude a concurrent ectopic pregnancy."

However, in the absence of these masses, torsion can still occur, potentially indicating an underlying anatomical abnormality that predisposes to recurrent torsion. This report presents a distinctive surgical technique used in a young girl in her early adolescence with recurrent right ovarian torsion. The patient, with a history of torsion managed by detorsion, presented again with symptoms suggestive of recurrence. Emergency diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a twisted but viable right ovary at risk of future torsion. To prevent a recurrence, a new approach was employed: the right ovarian ligament was plicated with 2-0 prolene, and the ovary was fixed to the right round ligament. The procedure successfully stabilised the ovary and prevented further torsion. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. This case demonstrates the potential of oophoropexy as an effective technique for managing recurrent ovarian torsion in adolescents."

We treated a 49-year-old Japanese woman with a history of gravida (n=5), parity (n=3), and cesarean sections (n=2). After visiting a physician due to abdominal pain and vomiting, she was referred to our hospital based on suspicion of ovarian torsion. Emergency surgery at our hospital revealed that the patient's small intestine was contained within the defective hilar membrane, resulting in a uterine broad ligament hernia. With the cooperation of the intestinal surgeon, we performed a resection and anastomosis of the necrotic small intestine in the herniated area. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the 9th postoperative day. A uterine broad ligament hernia causes necrosis of the small intestine and can be life-threatening. Women with a history of surgery or delivery might be at higher risk for this hernia. The swollen small intestine at the hernia site is often mistakenly diagnosed as adnexal torsion. In this patient's case, we diagnosed the uterine broad ligament hernia with necrotic small intestine during the surgery. The prompt surgery enabled a good patient prognosis."

The objective of this study was to evaluate if low dose furosemide plus IV fluid administration results in faster bladder filling time in comparison to IV fluid administration alone in females age 8-18 with suspected ovarian torsion. This was a randomized, placebo controlled, single blinded pilot study using convenience sampling to target females ages 8 to 18 years seen in the pediatric emergency department and undergoing a trans-abdominal pelvic US to assess for ovarian torsion. Enrolled patients were assigned to the experimental group, receiving 0.1 mg/kg (max 5 mg) of furosemide, or the control group, receiving a 5 mL normal saline (NS) flush. Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) evaluation of the bladder was performed every 30 min until the bladder was determined to be of adequate size and morphology to perform the trans-abdominal pelvic US. Bladder filling as confirmed by POCUS occurred a median of 90 min sooner in the furosemide group compared with the control group (p ≤0.001). Compared with the control group, radiology-performed US occurred 92 min sooner (p ≤0.001) and US interpretation by a radiologist occurred 94 min sooner (p ≤0.001) for individuals receiving furosemide. Furosemide administration leads to a statistically and clinically significant difference in the time to fill the bladder of pediatric females awaiting pelvic US and leads to more rapid ultrasonography and interpretation by a radiologist in our setting."

Despite its potentially life-threatening nature, the absence of definitive preoperative diagnostic criteria for IMP complicates its early detection and management, especially in patients without known risk factors. Additionally, management becomes more challenging when there is an elevated risk of hemorrhage. We report the case of a 34-year-old nulligravid woman referred to a tertiary hospital with suspected EP and bilateral ovarian endometriomas following intrauterine insemination. The patient had no history of uterine trauma or ET. Blood tests and ultrasonography supported the diagnosis of EP, and computed tomography suggested peritoneal pregnancy. Upon further investigation, the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, presenting with a platelet count of 30,000/μL. Due to the associated risk of hemorrhage, we proceeded with emergency exploratory laparoscopy after platelet transfusion. Intraoperatively, when an IMP was identified, the procedure was rapidly converted to laparotomy owing to bleeding risk associated with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The gestational sac covered with the uterine serosa was dissected, and the uterine defect was repaired to preserve fertility. The blood loss was 320 mL. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of IMP. The patient later resumed ART and successfully achieved term pregnancy, leading to a normal vaginal delivery 3 years after the initial surgery. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of IMP are critical to prevent severe intraperitoneal bleeding, while preserving future fertility."

This study aimed to determine whether single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a safe and effective treatment method compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery with multiple ports. This study searched 6 databases from their inception to May 15, 2024, for articles comparing the safety outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery with conventional laparoscopic surgery in managing women with ectopic pregnancy. This study included all studies that evaluated the safety outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery in patients with ectopic pregnancy and included at least 1 of our preselected outcomes. In addition, this study included both randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Review Manager (version 5.4.1) and OpenMetaAnalyst software were used to analyze the extracted data. In addition, this study used odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes, mean difference for continuous outcomes, a fixed effects model for homogeneous outcomes, and a random effects model for heterogeneous outcomes. Furthermore, heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 and P values. After removing duplicates, this study identified 83 studies. Using a 2-step screening process, this study excluded non-English and animal studies and included randomized controlled trials and observational studies that included at least 1 of our preselected outcomes. Ultimately, 12 studies were included in the final synthesis. Our analysis showed a significant favoring of the single-incision laparoscopic surgery group in the pain visual analog scale score (median difference=-0.57; P<.01). However, our study found no statistically significant difference between both procedures in the times of analgesic use (median difference=-0.08; P=.19), intraoperative complications (odds ratio=1.17; P=.8), postoperative complications (odds ratio=1.02; P=.96), conversion to laparotomy (odds ratio=1.40; P=.59), bowel injury (odds ratio=1.42; P=.8), and postoperative fever (odds ratio=0.52; P=.42). The use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery for treating ectopic pregnancy may reduce postoperative pain with similar rates of analgesic use. The incidences of intraoperative and postoperative complications were comparable. Furthermore, the rates of conversion to laparotomy, bowel injury, and postoperative fever were similar between the 2 techniques. Our results seem to show that single-incision laparoscopic surgery is noninferior to conventional laparoscopic surgery for the safe treatment of ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a serious clinical gynecological emergency. Patients with EP history are at higher risk of EP resulting from IVF/ICSI (IVF-EP). Besides, studies have suggested that previous EP treatments may affect the incidence of IVF-EP. However, this result does not consider possible confounding factors due to the number of previous EP. Therefore, we assessed the impact of salpingectomy on the risk and characteristics of IVF-EP in patients with different previous spontaneous EP. This retrospective cohort study included 43 647 patients receiving their first IVF/ICSI treatments at our center from January 2013 to June 2022. Cohorts were assigned according to the number of previous spontaneous EP by propensity score matching. After propensity score matching, there were 3252 participants in the no previous EP history cohort (NEP cohort), 3252 in the one EP history cohort (One-EP cohort), and 1571 in the 2 or more EP history cohort (> = 2 EP cohort). To assess the effect of previous salpingectomy on IVF-EP, One-EP cohort and > =2 EP cohort were divided into three subcohorts separately, according to their tubal statuses. The IVF-EP rate was significantly higher in patients with EP history (NEP cohort: 1.3% vs. One-EP cohort: 2.2% vs. >=2 EP cohort: 2.0%, p = 0.023). In subcohort analysis, patients with different tubal statuses presented no statistical differences in IVF-EP rate (both in One-EP cohort and > =2 EP cohort). Considering the interaction between tubal status and number of previous EP, binary logistic regression was performed and it was demonstrated that bilateral salpingectomy might reduce the risk of IVF-EP in patients with recurrent EP history but increase the risk of non-tubal IVF-EP, while the history of spontaneous EP increased both IVF-EP and non-tubal IVF-EP rate. Previous EP history was associated with a higher risk of IVF-EP and non-tubal IVF-EP. Salpingectomy reduced the overall risk of IVF-EP in patients with EP history, while bilateral salpingectomy increased the risk of non-tubal IVF-EP."

The study has a superiority design regarding specificity for non-ectopic pregnancy for M4, given that the primary outcome of sensitivity for ectopic pregnancy (EP) is non-inferior in comparison with the NICE algorithm. Emergency gynaecology units in Sweden. 595 women with PUL. Participants were randomised (1:1) to M4 or the NICE algorithm after two serum human chorionic (hCG) levels and were categorised as high or low risk of having an EP. The diagnostic performance was evaluated on cross-sectional data and utility by parallel groups. The proportion of EP categorised as high risk (sensitivity) and non-ectopic pregnancies categorised as low risk (specificity). Clinical outcomes were assessed. The sensitivity for EP was 79% (115 of 146) for M4 versus 85% (124 of 146) for the NICE algorithm, p = 0.1496 and the specificity for non-ectopic pregnancies was 67% (300 of 449) for M4 and 74% (334 of 449) for the NICE algorithm, p = 0.0003. Clinical outcomes were similar between groups. The sensitivity for EP by M4 was non-inferior to NICE, but specificity was better for the NICE algorithm. No between group differences were observed for clinical outcomes. NCT03461835, https://www. gov."

    "abstract": "Isolated fallopian tube torsion (IFTT) is a rare cause of surgical emergency and is difficult to diagnose. We present a case of IFTT in a 14-year-old girl who presented with an acute abdomen. Based on the clinical and computed tomographic findings, an initial diagnosis of ovarian torsion was considered. However, an emergency laparoscopic surgery revealed a left necrotic hemorrhagic tubal torsion. Subsequently, a left salpingectomy was performed with the preservation of both ovaries. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of IFTT with hydrosalpinx. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with IFTT and emphasizes the important role of early surgical intervention in preventing morbidity and preserving ovaries. A brief review of the literature on IFTT in terms of its diagnostic and therapeutic approaches is discussed."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTDs) are a group of benign and malignant tumors that arise from placental tissue. Ectopic pregnancies most commonly occur within the fallopian tubes. The estimated incidence of ectopic gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTDs) is approximated at 1.5 per 1 000 000 pregnancies, which makes it a very rare condition. The diagnosis is challenging since the clinical presentation often mimics conventional ectopic pregnancy, but management approaches are significantly different. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old woman (G7 T4 P0 A2 L4) presented to the Emergency Department with a period of amenorrhea followed by vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain. Right-side abdominal tenderness was noted upon physical examination. Laboratory investigations showed elevated serum ß-hCG level. Ultrasound examination showed a normal-size uterus. No intrauterine gestational sac was identified. An echogenic mass with central lucency was noted in the right adnexa, measuring 2.1×1.8 cm, with minimal free fluid present in the pouch of Douglas. The findings were suggestive of a ruptured right-side ectopic pregnancy. The patient underwent laparoscopic salpingectomy. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed a complete hydatidiform mole with vascular invasion. The patient was treated conservatively and was followed up by a serial ß-hCG level until she achieved 3 consecutive negative ß-hCG titers. CONCLUSIONS Invasive moles located in the fallopian tube are very rare in the literature, and further research is needed to ascertain the proper management of such cases. Histopathological examination of the salpingectomy specimen has an essential role in confirming the diagnosis of ectopic GTDs and guiding the management."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the value of contrast-enhanced CT in diagnosing ultrasonography-unspecified adnexal torsion (AT). Surgically confirmed patients with painful pelvic masses (n = 165) were retrospectively collected from two institutes. Two senior radiologists independently reviewed the CT images and determined the Hounsfield unit difference between non-contrast vs portal venous phases (ΔHUPV-NC) in both derivation and validation samples. The cutoff value, sensitivity, specificity, predictivity, and reproducibility of the ΔHUPV-NC and other visually assessed CT signs were analyzed and compared using the receiver-operating characteristic curve, multivariable regression, and inter-rater agreement assays, respectively. Women with twisted (n = 73 [47 ± 19 years]) or untwisted (n = 92 [40 ± 15 years]) adnexal lesions were reviewed. The ΔHUPV-NC ≤ 17.5 HU (AUC: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.96]; sensitivity: 95% [95% CI: 87, 98]; and specificity: 88% [95% CI: 80, 94]) was the independent predictor of AT (OR: 137 [95% CI: 39, 481], p < 0.001). After training in ΔHUPV-NC measurement, the agreement between two junior residents and the consensus increased from fair (resident-1: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.41]; resident-2: 0.24 [95% CI: 0.1, 0.39]) to substantial (resident-1: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.65, 0.85]; resident-2: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.62, 0.83]). The post-training diagnostic accuracy (both residents: 81% [95% CI: 74, 87]) was higher than the pre-training accuracy (resident-1: 67% [95% CI: 59, 74], p = 0.007; resident-2: 66% [95% CI: 58, 73], p = 0.002). The sign of ΔHUPV-NC ≤ 17.5 HU in contrast-enhanced CT can be used to predict the ultrasonography-unspecified AT. The decreased attenuation difference between non-contrast vs portal venous phases, a quantitative measurement-based CT sign, highlights the value of using contrast-enhanced CT as a second-line imaging approach after an equivocal ultrasonographic examination to diagnose AT in emergency settings. The value of contrast-enhanced CT in diagnosing ultrasonography-unspecified AT is underestimated. The ΔHUPV-NC ≤ 17.5 HU is the only predictor to diagnose the ultrasonography-unspecified AT. Contrast-enhanced CT can be used as a second-line imaging approach after an equivocal ultrasonographic examination."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is defined as the concurrent presence of both an intrauterine pregnancy and an extrauterine (typically ectopic) pregnancy. This report presents the case of a 36-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain. A comprehensive evaluation, including transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound imaging, revealed a heterotopic pregnancy at an estimated gestational age of six weeks and two days. The ultrasound examination confirmed an intrauterine pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity and a visible fetal pole, as well as a complex vascular lesion in the left adnexal region. Consequently, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, including a left salpingectomy, to remove the ruptured left tubal ectopic pregnancy. The ectopic pregnancy was successfully excised, and the intrauterine embryo was preserved. Following this surgical intervention, the pregnancy progressed without complications, culminating in the delivery of a healthy infant at 39 weeks of gestation. With timely and appropriate treatment, a heterotopic pregnancy can result in a successful live birth, yielding favorable outcomes for both mother and child. This case underscores the necessity of considering heterotopic pregnancy even in the absence of risk factors and highlights the importance of multidisciplinary management to achieve optimal outcomes."

Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial, particularly in women of reproductive age presenting with acute abdominal pain. This audit aimed to assess the completeness and accuracy of gynecological history documentation, including pregnancy status, in female patients admitted for emergency surgery due to abdominal pain. Methods A retrospective audit was conducted within a single NHS Trust, analyzing the surgical assessment documents of 50 female patients aged 12-50 years admitted for emergency surgery. Data collected included documentation of pregnancy status, gynecological history, last menstrual period, sexual activity, and contraceptive use. A subsequent audit cycle assessed the impact of an educational intervention on documentation practices. Results Initial findings revealed significant deficiencies in the documentation of key gynecological parameters. Pregnancy status was documented in only 14% of cases, and contraceptive use in 20%. A substantial proportion of cases lacked documentation of gynecological history 50% and sexual history 56%. An educational intervention resulted in a significant improvement in the documentation of sexual history, contraceptive use, and pregnancy status. Conclusion This audit revealed significant deficiencies in the initial gynecological assessment of female patients with acute abdominal pain, particularly regarding the documentation of pregnancy status, menstrual history, and contraceptive use. The study highlights the need for improved clinical practices, including enhanced medical education, standardized assessment protocols, and electronic documentation of pregnancy status. Continued research is crucial to address these deficiencies and optimize patient care within the NHS."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is a rare type of pathological pregnancy, and the most common site of concomitant ectopic pregnancy (EP) is the fallopian tube. Some studies have shown that expectant treatment could be considered because some EPs tend to regress spontaneously. However, data on the expectant treatment of HP are lacking. This study aimed to examine the outcomes of eutopic pregnancies following expectant management of concomitant tubal EP after in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This was a retrospective, observational matched cohort study. All patients who conceived with tubal HP (HTP) via IVF/ICSI and were treated expectantly between January 2010 and December 2021 were enrolled. Each HTP patient managed expectantly (A) was randomly matched with one control patient who conceived with a solely eutopic pregnancy (B) and one HTP patient who underwent surgical therapy (C) from our clinical database according to predefined criteria. The expectant group and the control groups were matched for maternal age (MA; ±1 year), gravidity (0; ≥1) and gestational age (GA) at presentation (± 2 days). The pregnancy outcomes of the study group and the control groups were compared. More than three-quarters of the EPs in patients treated expectantly were inhomogeneous solid masses (n = 95, 76.6%), and an empty gestational sac was the second most common (n = 18, 14.5%). The rates of live birth (76.6%, 79.0%, 73.4%; P = 0.647 (A versus B); P = 0.557 (A versus C)) and early miscarriage (21.8%, 19.4%, 25.8%; P = 0.637 (A versus B); P = 0.456 (A versus C)) in the expectant group were similar to those in the eutopic group and those in the surgical group. There were no significant differences in of the preterm birth rate (7.3%, 7.3%, 7.3%; P = 1.000 (A versus B); P = 1.000 (A versus C)), perinatal mortality (1.0%, 1.0%, 1.1%; P = 1.000 (A versus B); P = 1.000 (A versus C)), GA at delivery (38.7 ± 2.1, 38.4 ± 2.4, 38.5 ± 2.3 weeks; P = 0.286 (A versus B); P = 0.425 (A versus C)) or birth weight (3294.8 ± 507.2, 3238.2 ± 646.1, 3194.5 ± 452.9 g; P = 0.498 (A versus B); P = 0.157 (A versus C)). Expectant management was an option for select women with HTP. The prognoses of the concomitant eutopic pregnancies were comparable to those of the solely eutopic singleton pregnancies and the HTPs managed surgically. The application of this protocol in clinical practice significantly reduces the need for surgical or medical treatment of EP. Notably, close follow-up is required, and patients need to be vigilant and have immediate access to medical resources in case of an emergency."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Acute epiploic appendagitis is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain characterized by pain in the left or right lower quadrants of the abdomen. It is caused by torsion or spontaneous venous thrombosis of one of the epiploic appendages, which are found along the colon, most commonly in the sigmoid colon. The literature consistently compares the presenting symptoms and clinical picture of acute epiploic appendagitis to acute diverticulitis and acute appendicitis. However, ovarian torsion is not reported as a differential diagnosis for this pathology in the literature. CASE REPORT This case report demonstrates a female patient in her late 30s presenting with acute left iliac fossa pain associated with vomiting, in the context of a negative beta-hCG blood test. The history of severe unilateral intermittent pelvic pain progressing to constant pain associated with vomiting led to a working differential diagnosis of ovarian torsion. A bimanual vaginal examination was positive for tenderness in the left iliac fossa with no palpable adnexal masses or cervical motion tenderness. Therefore, the patient underwent an emergency diagnostic laparoscopy and was found to have normal ovaries, with torsion of an epiploic appendage identified. A diagnosis of acute epiploic appendagitis was made. CONCLUSIONS This case report demonstrates the importance of considering acute epiploic appendagitis as a rare differential diagnosis for ovarian torsion in female patients. With the management of this pathology being non-operative, identification of this condition on ultrasound or computed tomography is essential in avoiding unnecessary surgery for patients with this pathology."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies are a significant clinical concern, with 90 % occurring in the fallopian tubes. However, they can also manifest in other locations, including the cervix, ovary, and abdominal cavity. Abdominal pregnancies, which constitute less than 1 % of ectopic pregnancies, are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Among these, pregnancies located in the broad ligament are particularly rare and can sometimes be carried to term. This case report discusses a 27-year-old patient presenting with a 14-week pregnancy diagnosed in the broad ligament, highlighting the challenges in prenatal diagnosis and the potential complications associated with this condition. The report details the clinical management, including an exploratory laparotomy and subsequent treatment, and underscores the importance of awareness and timely intervention in cases of broad ligament ectopic pregnancies. This case contributes to the limited literature on this uncommon type of ectopic pregnancy and emphasizes the need for further research to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Ectopic pregnancy of the broad ligament is a relatively rare pathology documented in the literature. Its diagnosis is clinical and paraclinical, especially if ultrasound is performed early. Management is similar to that of an abdominal pregnancy. Maternal prognosis can be difficult if management is less than optimal in terms of surgery, anesthesia, resuscitation and the absence of blood products. This is why first-trimester ultrasound is so important. This case underscores the importance of awareness and timely intervention in managing broad ligament ectopic pregnancies, and highlighting the need for further research to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy, defined as the implantation of a developing pregnancy outside of the endometrial cavity of the uterus, is the leading cause of early-pregnancy maternal mortality. The majority of ectopic pregnancies implant in a fallopian tube. Acute complications may include rupture of the fallopian tube or rupture of ectopic pregnancy, haemorrhage and hypovolaemic shock, or occur secondary to treatments such as emergency surgery or blood transfusions, and ultimately increase the risk of maternal death. After ectopic pregnancy, patients may experience ongoing morbidity, including chronic pain, infertility and psychological distress. Assessment of ectopic pregnancy should focus on prompt diagnosis based on clinical and investigative findings but should also reflect a patient-centred approach with acknowledgement of potential psychological distress associated with pregnancy loss and reduced future fertility. Over the last four decades, the foundations of non-invasive diagnosis have been transvaginal sonography and serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin, with diagnostic laparoscopy as a confirmatory test if surgical treatment is planned. Once diagnosed, ectopic pregnancy can be managed expectantly, treated medically with methotrexate or managed surgically. Future fertility is an important but often overlooked aspect in the management of ectopic pregnancy."

A 32-year-old G3P1 female presented to our emergency room with symptoms related to a suspected ectopic interstitial pregnancy managed in another hospital using a conservative pharmacological approach. After discussing the risks, firstly she underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination, then a diagnostic hysteroscopy to clarify the unclear ultrasound finding, followed by a successful robot-assisted laparoscopic cornual resection. Hysteroscopy demonstrated an empty uterine cavity, confirming the suspect of pregnancy localization into the interstitial portion of the tubal stump. Through the robot-assisted laparoscopic approach, all the trophoblastic tissue was removed without causing significant damage to the surrounding myometrium and preserving the patient's fertility. No post-operative complications were recorded. The robotic approach successfully allowed the cornual resection, with minimal blood loss and optimal suturing of the uterine defect. Although our knowledge is still limited, it is possible that the pregnancy nested in the tubal residue after being properly fertilized into the intact tube. However, it cannot be ruled out that there have been remodeling phenomena of the tubal residue so that it has acquired the ability to intercept the oocyte."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion during pregnancy is a rare condition that requires prompt diagnosis and repositioning to preserve ovarian function. A 32-year-old woman underwent a successful pregnancy after FET, but was hospitalized for observation because of a threatened abortion. During the 8th week of pregnancy, a transvaginal ultrasound examination was performed due to sudden lower abdominal pain, which displayed an 8.3×5.2cm right ovary and a 4.3×3.6 cm enhanced echogenic mass over the right ovary with striated structures. Consequently, a preliminary diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made, and urgent laparoscopic exploration was conducted. Intraoperatively, the right fallopian tube and right ovary were rotated counterclockwise by 720 degrees. After rotate and reposition the right ovary and fallopian tube, a 3 cm diameter cyst was punctured. After 1 hour of observation, a 2×1×1cm segment of ovarian tissue was excised. Pregnancy was maintained with aggressive postoperative luteal support and anti-infective treatment. The use of clomiphene citrate during endometrium preparation for frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles may elevate the risk of ovarian torsion. Laparoscopic ovarian repositioning after ovarian torsion in pregnant women, even those with threatened abortion, is safe when combined with postoperative anti-infective treatment and intensive luteal support."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency whereby the ovary twists, or torts, on its ligamentous support and potentially compromises vascular supply to both the ovary and Fallopian tube. It accounts for 2-3% of all acute gynecological emergencies, yet is a condition that is rarely reported to occur after hysterectomy. While it is well established that ovarian torsion can occur after laparoscopic hysterectomy, we report on the rare occurrence of ovarian torsion occurring post the supposedly preventative ovarian transposition suspension procedure or ovariopexy. This highlights that further evaluation of laparoscopic surgical techniques are required to prevent this exquisitely painful gynecological condition occurring postoperatively. We report two cases of ovarian torsion post-primary laparoscopic radical hysterectomy performed for cervical malignancy. Both patients were Caucasian, multiparous, premenopausal female patients, aged 37 and 39 years old. Ovarian transposition suspension was performed at the primary procedure to allow ovarian function to be preserved if the patient's required postoperative pelvic irradiation if surgically upstaged. Both patients underwent emergency laparoscopic detorsion, with one torsion due to reoccurrence of her cervical cancer. Adnexal torsion is estimated to occur between 1% and 8% in post-hysterectomy cases. It can be a difficult to diagnose condition, with prudent history-taking, relevant investigations, and a low threshold to consider laparoscopy forming essential clinical acumen. Unfortunately, the suspension of the ovaries post-hysterectomy does not exclude future ovarian torsion. With rising rates of cervical cancer in premenopausal women, reportedly increasing by 37% in the 25-34 age range in the United Kingdom (National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England. 2021), further research is needed to improve techniques to allow for safe ovarian conservation for these patients while undergoing operative treatment of cervical cancer."

We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 1452 patients presenting for MA between 23 March 2020 and 30 September 2020. Descriptive statistics, 2 × 2 chi-square tests, and Fisher exact tests were used to compare characteristics and outcomes between groups. Of the 1307 patients who received a prescription, 895 (68.5%) were in the no-test group and 412 (31.5%) were in the test group. The success rate was 95.2%, with no significant difference between groups (94.0% and 95.8%, P = 0.194). Rates of adverse events were low, with 28 patients presenting for emergency department visits (2.1%), 62 having clinically significant retained products of conception (4.7%), 5 with heavy bleeding requiring treatment (0.4%), 16 with ongoing pregnancy (1.2%), and 3 requiring ectopic pregnancy management (0.2%).

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for the occurrence of EP. A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed on the electronic databases MEDLINE/PubMed, LILACS, The Cochrane Library, and Virtual Health Library (VHL), searching the following terms \"Ectopic Pregnancy\" or \"Ectopic Gestation\" and \"Risk Factors\" or \"Predisposing Factors\". The inclusion criteria were observational studies published in English and Portuguese. We excluded studies with undefined methodology and those published before the year 2000. The authors independently read the titles, abstracts, and full texts, using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and discussed any differences. Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality were performed by each author in a standardized way. Sixteen risk factors were evaluated. The meta-analysis calculations were performed using the Reviewer Manager 5.3 software (RevMan 5.3). The study found 715 studies, of which 11 were selected for review. The surveys were conducted between 2003 and 2019 and included 25 051 patients. The study revealed that several factors were strongly associated with the occurrence of EP. These included EP history (OR 9.03; 95% CI: 7.18-11.35; I2 = 67%), pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 4.00; 95% CI: 3.46-4.61; I2 = 0%), infertility (OR 3.70; 95% CI: 3.23-4.23; I2 = 48%), abdominal and pelvic surgeries (OR 5.60; 95% CI: 4.83-6.49; I2 = 81%), and previous tubal ligation (OR 5.59; 95% CI: 2.49-12.55; I2 = 0%). Furthermore, the study showed that advanced maternal age, smoking, number of partners exceeding one, history of spontaneous and induced abortion, previous use of emergency contraception, and intrauterine device, demonstrated a slightly increased risk. Advanced maternal age within the range of 30-34 years (OR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.03-1.24; I1 = 11%) and ≥ 40 years (OR 1.46; 95% CI: 1.19-1.78; I1 = 88%), marital status (OR 1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.37; I2 = 88%), and the use of oral contraceptives (OR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66-0.90; I2 = 86%) were also found to be associated with a slightly increased or decreased risk of EP, respectively. The impact of condom use on the occurrence of EP seems to be very limited (OR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.83-1.05; I2 = 83%). Based on the study findings, it is suggested that the presence of strong risk factors warrants the implementation of a screening policy for EP among these women."

MRI proved crucial in differentiating the tumor's fibrous stroma from malignant characteristics, and the patient had a positive outcome postsurgery. The case underscores the importance of timely surgical intervention, especially in emergencies like ovarian torsion, and highlights the role of advanced imaging in guiding diagnosis and management."

    "abstract": "Primary splenic pregnancy is a rare form of extratubal ectopic pregnancy, frequently associated with life-threatening abdominal bleeding, with only 51 cases reported in the worldwide literature. The aim of this work, through the proposal of its own index case, is to identify the fundamental steps of the diagnostic process, crucial to reduce the mortality rate, while evaluating the available therapeutic options, through a review of the literature, particularly the more conservative ones, to avoid splenectomy. We present the case of a 22-year-old woman, showing her diagnostic-therapeutic pathway. We searched Pubmed and other sources for all publications in English and all available non-English literature, including historical publications, on this rare topic, to identify the best treatment for these patients. We classified each article by clinical onset, diagnostic and therapeutic strategy, and histological findings, if available. We reviewed all the 43 cases available in the English-language literature (plus another paper in German), finding that 72.7% of patients presented in an emergency setting. Seventy-five percent of patients required splenectomy, 6.8% received pharmacological-only therapy, 11.3% received arterial embolization before definitive treatment. The other ones received non-radical surgical treatment. Primary splenic pregnancy presents challenging diagnostic and therapeutic features. Treatment options (pharmacological, interventional, and/or surgical) should be tailored based on the clinical presentation and hemodynamic status of the patient. Our work would like to stimulate the validation of evidence-based therapeutic strategies validated by clinical experience."

    "title": "Pediatric Ovarian Torsion in an 8-year Old Girl; A Case Report Study.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion in children causes abdominal pain. The clinical symptoms resemble other abdominal diseases, such as appendicitis. It happens when the ovary twists on its ligamentous attachment, which stops blood from getting to the ovary. A fast diagnosis accompanied by a high level of clinical suspicion and immediate surgical intervention is obligatory to save the ovaries and avoid complications. In this case study, we describe a case of ovarian torsion in an 8-year-old Iranian girl who came with persistent (non-colicky) right-side abdominal pain. After ultrasonographic examinations, she was identified with an enlarged heterogeneous right ovary indicative of ovarian torsion and underwent emergency laparotomy without oophorectomy. It may be challenging to determine the source of abdominal pain in pediatric patients, due to factors such as insufficiently comprehensive medical histories and examinations, limitations in con-ducting radiological procedures, as well as the comparatively diminished specificity of results in contrast to adult populations. If torsion is confirmed by ultrasonography, detorsion with\\ without oophorectomy is advised for conservative treatment. This article presents a case study and a brief examination of the issues and complications associated with the identification and management of pediatric ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "Retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy (REP) is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy, in which fertilised eggs are implanted in the retroperitoneal cavity. Due to its atypical location and non-specific symptoms, REP is often misdiagnosed, leading to delayed treatment. This condition poses serious risks owing to its proximity to the retroperitoneal blood vessels. Limited research and lack of specific guidelines make the management of REP challenging. A 47-year-old woman with REP was initially misdiagnosed as having acute gastroenteritis due to severe abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. She had amenorrhoea and significant lower abdominal pain, but no vaginal bleeding. After 35 days of amenorrhoea, the patient's serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was 16111.94 mIU/mL. Imaging revealed no intrauterine gestational sac; however, a mass was detected in the left adnexal area. Emergency laparoscopy identified a 3.0 cm ectopic mass in the retroperitoneal space, adjacent to the lower edge of the left broad ligament and near critical structures, with surface rupture and bleeding. The mass was surgically removed, and the patient's β-hCG levels returned to normal 33 days post-surgery. In addition, we reviewed previously published English literature on REP, highlighting its characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment with the aim of improving the understanding and management of the condition. REP is difficult to diagnose because of its rarity and nonspecific symptoms. Early diagnosis relies on serum β-hCG testing, ultrasonography, and radiological examination. When β-hCG is elevated and no gestational sac is found within the uterus or at common ectopic sites, REP should be considered. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for this condition."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) is a rare gynaecological emergency that requires a prompt diagnosis for optimal patient management. To determine whether there were any biomarkers suitable for the non-invasive detection of OT, two independent reviewers performed systematic searches of five literature databases (PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, and CINAHL) from inception until October 1st, 2023. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the search included patients with OT that had quantified biomarker expression with no age, geographical location, publication date, language, or setting restrictions. Articles were excluded if OT was found incidentally, was based on qualitative analyses, or were not primary research articles. Full texts of 23 selected articles were assessed for risk of bias and quality assurance using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for clinical studies and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for the assessment of pre-clinical (animal) studies. A total of 11 articles described studies on animals and all described serum biomarkers comparing results between OT versus a sham operation, a control group, or readings before and after OT. Ischaemia-modified albumhumin (IMA), serum D-dimer (s-DD), heat shock protein-70 (hsp-70), Pentraxin-3 (PTX3), and c-reactive protein (CRP) each showed the most promise, with p-values for the difference between OT and control groups achieving ≤ 0.001. In studies of humans, the biomarkers ranged from 16.4 to 92.3% sensitivity and 77-100% specificity. The most promising biomarkers for the early prediction of OT in patients included s-DD, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IMA, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Signal peptide, CUB domain, and EGF-like domain-containing 1 (SCUBE1) had a high specificity at 93.3%, second only to s-DD and a positive likelihood ratio (LR) > 10. IMA was the only other biomarker that also had a positive LR > 10, making it a promising diagnostic biomarker. The studies identified by this systematic literature review each analysed small patient groups but IMA, DD, and SCUBE1 nevertheless showed promise as serum biomarkers with a pooled LR > 10. However, further well-designed studies are needed to identify and evaluate individual markers or diagnostic panels to help clinicians manage this important organ-threatening condition."

Functional cysts, torsions, benign tumors, and malignancies occur within the ovaries of children and adolescents at varying frequencies. Careful conservative management, based on the ultrasonographic sign of presence of normal ovarian tissue, in most circumstances can lead to appropriate ovarian-preserving treatments. The symptomatic ovarian cyst is often due to complications such as hemorrhage and ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion represents surgical emergency, and a high index of clinical suspicion, based on ovarian volume and edema of the tissue, must be maintained to avoid inadvertent delay in therapy."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a serious obstetric condition that can be life-threatening, with various risk factors contributing to its development. In particular, in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques may lead to an increased rate EP. Additionally, also endometriosis seems to be related to this particular obstetrical condition. We report a rare case of ectopic pregnancy on the uterosacral ligament (USL) along with a suspected coexisting tubal ectopic pregnancy following IVF. The patient is a 48-year-old woman in menopause, with a history of pelvic endometriosis, who experienced sudden abdominal pain and vomiting at eight weeks of amenorrhea after undergoing a double heterologous frozen embryo transfer. Thorough examination and pelvic ultrasound, we diagnosed a hemoperitoneum due to a suspected heterotopic EP on the left USL and contralateral tube. Due to the sudden worsening of the patient's condition, we opted for a surgical procedure. An urgent laparotomy revealed a severe hemoperitoneum caused by an EP implanted on the left USL and a malacic, bleeding contralateral tube, both of which were removed, and hemostasis was then guaranteed. The histopathologic exam confirmed the EP on the left USL and an edematous tube without product of conception (POC). Comparing our case with others reported in the current literature, it appears that the etiopathogenetic mechanisms leading to this urgent obstetrical condition are various and not fully understood. Despite those circumstances, the present case highlights the importance of considering non-tubal ectopic pregnancies in the context of risk factors, including IVF techniques, endometriosis, and advanced age, in cases of abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum after a single or double embryo transfer. The treatment, which involves different professional figures, should be executed as soon as possible, with the aim of preserving the patient's life and any future desire for pregnancies."

    "abstract": "Isolated tubal torsion (ITT) is a surgical emergency that is less well characterized than ovarian torsion and presents with its own diagnostic challenges. We retrospectively examined patients with ITT and compared them to patients with ovarian torsion to better understand the unique features of this pathophysiologic process. The medical records of patients who were identified as having ITT or ovarian torsion intraoperatively between January 2019 and November 2022 were reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical documentation, diagnostic imaging reports, operative reports, and pathology results were collected. A total of 82 patients met inclusion criteria of which 62 (75.6%) had ovarian torsion and 20 (24.4%) had ITT. Most patients (63.4%) underwent 2 or more imaging studies prior to the operating room. A diagnosis of torsion occurred more often on preoperative imaging for the ovarian torsion group (67.7% ovarian torsion vs 35.0% ITT, P = .01). Doppler flow to the ovary was expectedly absent in 65.9% of ovarian torsion patients but interestingly also absent in 25% of ITT patients (P = .01). Patients with ovarian torsion were more likely to have ovarian cysts (56.5% vs 10.0%, P < .001), while patients with ITT were significantly more likely to have a paratubal cyst (90.0% vs 38.7%, P < .001). ITT is a surgical emergency that poses a risk to future fertility. Ultrasound studies, including doppler, may not be as definitive in patients with ITT and early cross-sectional imaging should be considered. When there is a high clinical suspicion for ovarian torsion or ITT, there should be a low threshold for diagnostic laparoscopy."

This review provides an in-depth exploration of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and anesthetic implications of factor XI deficiency, thereby emphasizing the useful role of anesthesiologists. The variable bleeding phenotype of the disorder necessitates a nuanced understanding and tailored management strategies to mitigate severe perioperative bleeding risks. Conventional coagulation tests, while useful, often fall short in predicting bleeding risks, underscoring the importance of advanced diagnostic tools, such as viscoelastic testing. Viscoelastic testing provides real-time data on clot stability, which allows for immediate intervention and more targeted therapeutic strategies compared to standard coagulation tests. A clinical case of a 25-year-old patient with factor XI deficiency undergoing emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy illustrates the application of viscoelastic testing in managing acute bleeding and optimizing patient outcomes and advocates for the development of standardized protocols, continuous monitoring techniques, and enhanced training programs to improve the perioperative care of patients with factor XI deficiency, providing anesthesiologists with the tools necessary to navigate the complexities of factor XI deficiency in the perioperative environment. Integrating these advanced diagnostic and therapeutic approaches could significantly improve patient safety and surgical outcomes in patients with complex coagulopathy."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pelvic inflammatory diseases and tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOAs) are rarely seen in non-sexually active (NSA) women. While the pathogenesis of TOA remains unclear, its risk factors include ascending infection of the genital tract, gastrointestinal tract translocation, congenital genitourinary anomalies, as well as virulence of the causative agents, with preceding bacteremia and septicemia. CASE REPORT Herein, we present the case of a 25-year-old female patient who was initially diagnosed with ovarian torsion and underwent diagnostic laparoscopy. Her intraoperative findings included bilateral TOAs and adhesions. Owing to this uncommon presentation, further investigation was conducted, including postoperative computed tomography. The results showed a likelihood of a perforated appendix, with a repeat laparoscopy confirming this diagnosis. Appendectomy and drainage were done. The microbial culture from the ovarian abscess revealed Streptococcus constellatus, a commensal organism found in the oral, gastrointestinal, and urogenital flora. This microorganism is rarely isolated as a pathogenic organism in immune-competent populations. Furthermore, the histopathology report of the appendix showed a rare occurrence of chronic active diverticulitis, with perforation and peri-appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS TOA in NSA women should be considered when evaluating differential diagnoses, with the possibility of infection with an atypical organism. Broad-spectrum antibiotics or multidrug therapy should be administered. When suspicion is raised, an imaging study with a broader view to detect the pathology of other organ systems is recommended. Lower abdominal pain in young female patients still poses a diagnostic dilemma and should be investigated; however, when the clinical presentation suggests a gynecological emergency, the time frame can pose challenges."

This study investigated the specific sonographic characteristics of IFTT and compared them to the characteristics of ovarian and adnexal torsion. Retrospective cohort study. Tertiary level gynecological ultrasound unit.: 225 women operated for suspected isolated ovarian, fallopian tube or adnexal torsion (ovary and tube) were included. Electronic medical records of patients diagnosed with torsion at our ultrasound unit from 2001 to 2018 were retrieved. Inclusion criteria were women operated for suspicion of isolated ovarian, fallopian tube or adnexal torsion (involving both ovary and tube), with a preoperative sonogram performed in our tertiary level gynecologic ultrasound unit. Patients operated after a sonographic examination in the emergency department were excluded. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to their laparoscopic diagnosis: IFTT, ovarian torsion, adnexal torsion or no torsion. The sonographic characteristics of the groups were compared and the diagnosis was confirmed according to laparoscopy findings. IFTT was reported in 28/225 (12.4%) cases. Ovarian volume was significantly lower in IFTT (29.2 ± 44 cm3) compared to ovarian torsion (111 ± 143 cm3, p = .037). There were fewer cases of ovarian edema in IFTT compared to ovarian torsion (12/22 (54.5%) vs. 54/63 (85.7%) respectively, p = .001). IFTT was associated with paraovarian cyst significantly more often than with ovarian torsion (13/24 (54.2%) vs. 4/75 (5.3%), respectively; p = .003). There was no difference in whirlpool sign rate and location between all forms of torsion. The sensitivity, specificity, Positive predictive value and Negative predictive value for IFTT were 88.4%, 83.3%, 95.8%, and 62% respectively. IFTT has distinct sonographic characteristics, including normal ipsilateral ovary, paraovarian cyst, and whirlpool sign. Awareness of these features may improve the diagnosis of IFTT and promote faster and more efficient treatment. Further studies are needed to establish these characteristics."

    "abstract": "To compare the characteristics and outcomes of non-surgical and surgical treatments for Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP). A retrospective study conducted at a tertiary university affiliated medical center, including all women diagnosed with Cesarean scar pregnancy between 2019 and 2023. Women treated non-surgically (including: methotrexate, uterine artery embolization and balloon catheter) were compared to women treated surgically (including: hysterectomy, hysteroscopy and excision of the pregnancy with or without uterine niche repair). Demographic information, medical history, obstetric and gynecological characteristics, presenting symptoms, imaging findings, management details, surgical characteristics, and follow-up data were collected from the women's electronic medical records. Primary outcome was defined as the β-hCG levels on follow-up visit at 2 weeks following treatment. 42 women were diagnosed with Cesarean scar pregnancy during the study period, of them 9 (21%) were treated non-surgically and 33 (79%) were treated surgically. Median age was 33 (30-36) year old and median BMI was 31 (27-35) kg/m2, with no statistical differences in-between the groups. Most of the women had previous two Cesarean sections (n = 12, 28%). 63% of the women were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. On transvaginal ultrasound examination, embryo was demonstrated in 66.7% and cardiac activity was observed in 75%. The median gestational age at diagnosis and β-hCG levels were comparable between the non-surgical and surgical treatment groups (p = 0.22, p = 0.61, respectively). In the surgical arm, the most common surgical procedure was excision of the pregnancy with uterine niche repair, that was performed in 14/42 (33%) of the women. Median hospitalization length was 3 (1-4) and 2 (1-3) days, for the non-surgical and surgical treatment groups, respectively (p = 0.51). The hemoglobin level before discharge was similar between the groups (p = 0.20). Only one woman in each group visited the emergency room before the follow-up visit (p = 0.31). β-hCG levels on follow-up were significantly lower in the surgical group compared to the non-surgical (p = 0.02). Cesarean scar pregnancy can be asymptomatic and should be suspected to enable early diagnosis. Both non-surgical and surgical treatments are viable options, with comparable hospitalization lengths; however, the surgical intervention group is expected to show a significantly faster decrease in β-hCG levels."

Ultrasound and pelvic MRI revealed a large, tubular-cystic mass separated from the right ovary and tubo-ovarian junction. Intraoperative findings revealed filmy adhesions and fimbriae emanating from this cystic lesion, as well as dilation of the medial portion of the right fallopian tube. Histopathology reported dilated, cystic structures with focal tubal-type epithelial lining, and a dilated fallopian tube lumen, consistent with hydrosalpinx.

    "abstract": "Choriocarcinoma is an aggressively invasive neoplasm, characterized by its rapid proliferation and propensity for metastasis to distant organs via hematogenous dissemination. Lungs (80%), vagina (30%), pelvis (20%), liver (10%), and brain (10%) are the most frequently metastasized organs. Renal metastases are very rare. The clinical manifestations of choriocarcinoma varies depending on the site of disease, making diagnosis challenging. In this report, we provide a clinical case of choriocarcinoma with metastases to the renal and pulmonary systems, displaying symptoms akin to those observed in ectopic pregnancy. A 27-year-old female, G2P1, with a previous history of full-term pregnancy in 2018, presented to the hospital with the onset of vaginal bleeding and accompanying abdominal aches. Investigations uncovered a left adnexal mass with a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level of 77,4 mIU/mL and a left pulmonary nodule measuring 31 mm x 21 mm. Laparoscopy was performed due to the high suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. However, no visible villi were identified during the surgery, and postoperative blood hCG levels continued to rise. A diagnostic curettage also failed to reveal any villi, maintaining the suspicion of a persistent ectopic pregnancy. Following two ineffective courses of methotrexate therapy, the patient was referred to our facility. Prior to her referral, an ultrasound had indicated a mass in the right kidney. However, upon arrival at our hospital, subsequent ultrasonography failed to detect any renal masses. Despite two months of outpatient monitoring, there was a sudden and significant increase in her serum hCG levels. An emergency laparoscopy was performed, revealing no pregnancy-related lesion. After surgery, the patient's hCG levels dropped dramatically to less than one-tenth of the original amount. Multisite enhanced computed tomography(CT)revealed suspicious lesions in both the renal and pulmonary regions. Upon thorough multidisciplinary consultation, a diagnosis of choriocarcinoma was entertained. Consequently, the patient successfully underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy and has remained recurrence-free for the past year. This case underscores the potential for choriocarcinoma in women of reproductive age who exhibit radiological signs of renal masses. Early and accurate diagnosis, followed by prompt intervention, is essential to prevent needless surgery procedures."

It included patients younger than 20 years old and of the female sex. International Classification of Diseases Version 10 and ICD 10 Procedure Coding System codes were utilized to define patients with adnexal torsion who underwent adnexal surgery. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were utilized to compare oophorectomy rates according to patient demographic characteristics. There were 263 sampled patients younger than 20 years old who presented to a US emergency department with a diagnosis of adnexal torsion and underwent adnexal surgery. Of them, 177 had an oophorectomy (67.3%); 85 had a minimally invasive surgery (48%). Compared with 10- to 14-year-olds, 15- to 19-year-olds were 2.54 times more likely to have an oophorectomy (95% CI, 1.42-4.71; Table 2). Despite standards for ovarian-sparing surgery since 2016 and data suggestive of safety since the 1990s, oophorectomy rates remain high in pediatric and adolescent patients with torsion who present to US emergency departments for care. Continued efforts should identify barriers to ovarian-sparing surgeries and better quantify specific clinical nuances when oophorectomies are performed."

The degree to which regionalization may be associated with access to urgent surgical care for time-sensitive conditions is not clear. To investigate whether transfers and travel distance have increased for 4 surgical conditions, and whether changes in transfers and travel distance have been more pronounced for rural vs urban children. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data from 9 State Inpatient Databases from 2002 to 2017. Participants included children aged younger than 18 years undergoing urgent or emergent procedures for malrotation with volvulus, esophageal foreign body, and ovarian and testicular torsion. Residential and hospital zip codes were categorized as rural or urban. Hospitals were categorized as pediatric hospitals, adult hospitals with pediatric services, and adult hospitals without pediatric services. Primary outcomes were transfer for care and travel distance between patients' home residences and the hospitals where care was provided. Transfer and travel distance were analyzed using multivariable regression models. Among the 5865 children younger than 18 years undergoing procedures for malrotation with volvulus, esophageal foreign body, ovarian torsion, or testicular torsion, 461 (7.9%) resided in a rural area; 1097 (20.5%) were Hispanic, 1334 (24.9%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 2255 (42.0%) were non-Hispanic White; 2763 (47.1%) were covered by private insurance and 2535 (43.2%) were covered by Medicaid; and the median (IQR) age was 9 (2-14) years. Most care was provided at adult hospitals (73.4% with and 16.9% without pediatric services); the number of hospitals providing this care decreased from 493 to 292 hospitals (2002 vs 2017). Transfer was associated with rural residence (adjusted odds ratio [aRR], 2.3 [95% CI, 1.8-3.0]; P < .001) and increased over time (2017 vs 2002: aOR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.0-3.8]; P < .001). Similarly, travel distance was associated with rural residence (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.4 [95% CI, 3.9-4.8]; P < .001) and increased over time (2017 vs 2002: aRR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.4]; P < .001). Rural children were more frequently transferred (2017 vs 2002) for esophageal foreign body (48.0% [12 of 25] vs 7.3% [4 of 55]; P < .001), ovarian torsion (26.7% [4 of 15] vs 0% [0 of 18]; P = .01), and testicular torsion (18.2% [2 of 11] vs 0% [0 of 16]; P = .04). Travel distance for rural children increased the most for torsions, from a median (IQR) of 19.1 (2.3-35.4) to 43.0 (21.6-98.8) miles (P = .03) for ovarian torsion and from 7.3 (0.4-23.7) to 44.5 (33.1-48.8) miles (P < .001) for testicular torsion. In this cross-sectional study of children with time-sensitive surgical conditions, the number of hospitals providing urgent surgical care to children decreased over time.

    "abstract": "Primary abdominal pregnancy is an extremely rare form of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies that occur in the liver and diaphragm are even rarer, limited case reports are available in the literature. A woman of childbearing age was transferred to the emergency department due to lumbar and abdominal pain radiating to the back toward the lower right. After a series of physical and auxiliary examinations, she was clinically diagnosed with hepatic ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopic surgery was performed to remove the pregnancy tissue and achieve hemostasis. After a period of follow-up, the patient was successfully cured. Paying attention to the patient's signs and utilizing imaging examination methods can help avoid missed diagnoses of liver pregnancy."

    "abstract": "An emergency medical evaluation for ovarian torsion should be conducted on any female who complains of stomach pain. More women in the reproductive age range experience ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion presenting postmenopausal is an uncommon occurrence. Torsion of ovaries can occur alone or with torsion of the fallopian tubes. Pain is the main presenting complaint, which may be accompanied by swelling, nausea, etc. In this instance, we have a 52-year-old woman who complained of lower abdominal pain on the right side. A transvaginal ultrasonography (USG) was done, and torsion of the right ovary was found. On further exploration, it was found to be gangrenous."

    "abstract": "Molar pregnancy is a topic in emergency medicine frequently tested and regularly discussed but is perhaps overshadowed by other conditions such as ectopic pregnancy. It is a rare diagnosis encountered in the emergency department (ED) and is part of a broad spectrum of pathological conditions that fall into the category of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Diagnosis of this potentially malignant condition requires the emergency physician to bear this condition in mind when treating any woman while considering obstetric-related conditions in the first trimester, vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pressure, and excessive nausea and vomiting. We present the case of a 20-year-old primigravida 12-week pregnant female who presented to the ED sent in by the midwifery clinic for evaluation with concerns for absent fetal heart tones and abnormal uterine appearance. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) performed upon arrival demonstrated an irregular complex echogenic uterine mass with anechoic areas and cystic structures suspicious for a molar pregnancy. Obstetrics-gynecology (OB-GYN) admitted the patient promptly for definitive surgical care, and tissue analysis confirmed a complete molar gestation. This case highlights the effectiveness of POCUS for prompt diagnosis and treatment of molar pregnancy in the ED."

    "abstract": "Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) usually occurs in patients undergoing assisted reproduction techniques and ovulation induction. Its variant, spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a potentially life-threatening disorder, is uncommon and only a few cases have been reported in association with hypothyroidism. This study analysed five patients with untreated chronic hypothyroidism presenting with multicystic ovaries, isosexual precocious puberty, and delayed bone age; subsequently, the follow-up and regression of ovarian pathology was assessed. Two patients had presented to the emergency department with menorrhagia and hypotension, of these, one had ovarian torsion at presentation. Three patients presented to the outpatient department: one for evaluation of short stature, one for premature menarche, and another with polycystic ovaries. They were all diagnosed with long-standing, untreated chronic hypothyroidism. There was regression of the size of the cystic ovaries on subsequent follow-up. In all these patients, long-standing hypothyroidism had resulted in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. The potentially life-threatening complications of this syndrome may be prevented by careful screening and a strong index of clinical suspicion at the outset. Long-standing, untreated primary hypothyroidism may result in spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. A high index of suspicion is required for an early and accurate diagnosis. The requirement for interdepartmental collaboration between gynaecology and endocrinology departments is essential for the successful management of this life-threatening but easily treatable disorder."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Adnexal torsion is characterised by the rotation of the ovary and, occasionally, the fallopian tube around their supporting ligaments by more than 45 degrees. It predominantly occurs during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, with an incidence of up to 0.1% in the third trimester. Dermoid and functional ovarian cysts, most commonly associated with benign serous cystadenomas, are frequently identified among the torted adnexal masses. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 32-year-old primigravida with a known ovarian cyst diagnosed in the first trimester, which was managed conservatively throughout the pregnancy. At 36 weeks of gestation, she presented with abdominal pain and was subsequently managed with an emergency caesarean section at 37 weeks due to the development of an acute surgical abdomen. During the procedure, a torted left tubo-ovarian complex was excised, with partial preservation of the healthy-appearing ovarian tissue. Histopathological examination identified the mass as a benign serous cystadenoma. Conclusions: Ovarian torsion during pregnancy poses a significant diagnostic challenge. The decision between conservative management and surgical intervention is primarily guided by a high index of suspicion for torsion."

The spontaneous incidence of heterotopic pregnancy in the general population has been estimated to be 1/30,000. This report discusses the case of a 37-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. Upon workup, a transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated a heterotopic pregnancy with an estimated gestational age of seven weeks. The ultrasounds confirmed an intrauterine pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity and a fetal pole along with a right adnexal ectopic pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity and a fetal pole. Additionally, a right paratubal cyst was incidentally found. The patient subsequently underwent exploratory laparotomy with a right salpingectomy for the removal of the right tubal pregnancy and a right paratubal cyst. This case denotes the significance of a carefully performed ultrasound examination, especially in the early weeks of pregnancy. Even when a standard pregnancy is visualized with ultrasound examination, it remains imperative for the examiner to meticulously examine the adnexa and interstitial portion of the fallopian tube. A heterotopic pregnancy has the potential to be life-threatening and can often go undetected, resulting in missed diagnoses."

This study seeks to review the various abnormalities found in the fallopian tube and establish the primary disease processes linked to it. These findings can provide valuable insights for future preventive healthcare measures. Utilizing PubMed, a search was conducted for articles published between 2009 and 2024 to investigate fallopian tube pathologies using case reports. The inclusion criteria focused on patients older than 18 years with confirmed or incidental fallopian tube pathology diagnoses. The study considered both common and uncommon presentations of fallopian tube pathologies, with a primary focus on identifying the presenting symptoms related to these conditions, such as primary infertility, severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypotension, and breathlessness (the last three could indicate a surgical emergency with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and subsequent hemoperitoneum). Fifteen studies were included in this review. The findings revealed three cases of genital tuberculosis, two cases of endometriosis, two cases of fallopian tube prolapse, three cases of ovarian cancer, and four cases of ectopic pregnancy. To confirm the presence of these conditions, histopathological examination was performed using specimens obtained through salpingectomy/salpingostomy. This study effectively highlighted the occurrence of rare presentations associated with common fallopian tube pathologies. By identifying different pathologies present in the fallopian tube, healthcare professionals can expand the range of existing pathologies that may be considered as potential differential diagnoses. This knowledge is essential in directing patient care and has the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a critical gynecological emergency that presents with sudden-onset abdominal pain and requires immediate intervention to prevent irreversible ovarian damage. This case report describes a 25-year-old female who presented with acute right lower quadrant pain, which had escalated to excruciating levels over the past 45 minutes, accompanied by persistent nausea and vomiting. She had no fever, vaginal bleeding, or dysuria, and her urine pregnancy test was negative. A physical examination revealed significant tenderness and guarding in the right lower abdomen, with no evidence of organomegaly or abnormal pelvic findings. Imaging studies, including ultrasound, confirmed the diagnosis of a complete ovarian torsion with associated necrosis. The patient underwent successful laparoscopic surgery, which involved the removal of the necrotic ovary and affected fallopian tube. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient fully recovered within a week. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis and surgical intervention in managing ovarian torsion to preserve ovarian function and prevent complications."

A national cross-sectional survey based on a multistage stratified sampling from 15 provinces of China was performed from May 2019 to April 2021. A total of 12 815 reproductive-aged (20-49 years) women were involved. The SRH experiences (including age at menarche, age at first sexual activity, history of abortion, miscarriage, recurrent miscarriage, stillbirth, age at first delivery, types of delivery), the history of gynaecological diseases and STDs, as well as the environmental factors of participants were investigated. Human development index (HDI) was utilised to categorise and describe the socioeconomic status of the regions. The prevalence rates of diseases were compared among different HDI regions. We observed a decrease in the mean age at menarche, an increase in the proportion of women who became sexually active before 20, and a modest rise in mean age at first childbirth across generations. Age-standardised prevalence estimates of miscarriage, recurrent miscarriage, artificial abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and stillbirth were 9.3, 1.4, 55.7, 3.3, and 2.1%, respectively. Approximately 50% of participants reported a history of gynaecological diseases, with vulvovaginitis, cervicitis, and pelvic infection diseases being the most prevalent. The overall prevalence of STDs was estimated at 22.2‰, with mycoplasma genitalium infection having the highest reported prevalence. Disease prevalence varies across HDI regions. Women's SRH behaviours and experiences have evolved, along with shifts in the spectrums of gynaecological diseases and STDs in China. Urgent recalibration of health care policies and disease control strategies is necessary, aligning them with women's changing SRH needs, ultimately ensuring their reproductive health and rights."

    "abstract": "The chances of a female of reproductive age presenting with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy are relatively low. Ectopic pregnancies make up 1-2% of all pregnancies and 20% of ectopic ruptures. The chances of a patient with an ovarian torsion with a dermoid cyst are also low. The incidence of ovarian torsions is 2-5%, and a dermoid cyst is found in 25% of all ovarian torsions. The odds of a single patient presenting with both a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and ovarian torsion with a dermoid cyst, along with other pathologies, including fibroids and endometriosis, are exceptionally improbable but not impossible. We present a case of a 32-year-old gravida 1 para 0000 (G1P0) female who presented to the emergency department (ED) after five weeks of amenorrhea with light vaginal bleeding and severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain. A transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) was performed and was questionable but unclear for an ectopic pregnancy. A diagnostic laparoscopy was indicated and confirmed the diagnoses of a left ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum, right ovarian torsion with a right ovarian dermoid cyst, multiple subserosal leiomyomas, and endometriosis of the posterior cul-de-sac. Given the unclear TVUS results, the ultimate decision to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy was largely based on the patient's history and presenting symptoms. This case demonstrates a pelvic quintet, five rare pelvic anomalies, in a single patient who received a potentially lifesaving salpingectomy, right cystectomy, and right ovarian detorsion."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a serious condition that can have significant morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of ectopic pregnancy, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that implants outside the normal uterine cavity. It most commonly presents with vaginal bleeding, abdominal or pelvic pain, and amenorrhea. Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include abnormalities of the fallopian tube, prior ectopic pregnancy, and age over 35 years, but a significant number of patients with confirmed ectopic pregnancy will not have an identifiable risk factor. In patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy, evaluation includes quantitative serum hCG, blood type, and ultrasound. Ultrasound is necessary regardless of the hCG level. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, resuscitation with blood products and early consultation of obstetrics/gynecology is necessary. Patients with confirmed ectopic pregnancy but who are otherwise stable may be managed medically or surgically. If a yolk sac or fetal pole is not seen in the uterus on ultrasound, this is considered a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), which may represent an early, failed, or ectopic pregnancy. Stable patients with a PUL who can reliably follow up are managed with close specialist follow up and repeat 48 h HCG level. These patients need to have an hCG level repeated every 48 h until diagnosed with a viable pregnancy, failed pregnancy, or ectopic pregnancy. Knowledge of the latest advances in managing ectopic pregnancy will help clinicians more quickly and accurately diagnose patients presenting with this potentially fatal condition."

This study examines the impact of point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department on the time to diagnosis, treatment, and surgical intervention for ectopic pregnancies. Our review encompassed studies involving patients with ectopic pregnancies who underwent point-of-care ultrasound in emergency settings. The comparator was standard radiology department ultra-sound. We included studies of any design, and the key outcomes were time to diagnosis, treatment, and operating room. Data synthesis employed a random-effects inverse-variance model. The GRADE approach was used to assess evidence quality, and the PRISMA checklist guided our methodology. Overall, four studies were included. For time to diagnosis, the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was -1.965, indicating a significant reduction. For time to treatment, the pooled SMD was -0.809, showing a modest effect with considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 87.5%). In surgically treating ectopic pregnancies, the impact was not statistically significant overall, but was significant for the subgroup of ruptured ectopic pregnancies. The overall quality of evidence was deemed very low due to moderate risk of bias, high heterogeneity, and publication bias. Point-of-care ultrasound in emergency departments significantly reduced the time to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The effect on time to treatment and operating room varied, with notable benefits observed in more severe cases. Despite these promising findings, the quality of evidence and high heterogeneity necessitate cautious interpretation and call for further research."

    "abstract": "Interstitial pregnancy is rare and exhibit a mortality rate notably higher than that observed in other types of ectopic pregnancies. The authors report a 38-year-old female admitted for a hemorrhagic shock. She was 10 weeks pregnant. The suspicion of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy arose based on amenorrhea accompanied by abdominal pain and a pelvic ultrasound showing an empty uterus and abundant free fluid in the abdomen. Emergent exploratory laparotomy was indicated by hemodynamic instability, revealing a ruptured left interstitial ectopic pregnancy. The use of three-dimensional ultrasonographic imaging specially in the first trimester improves the rate for early detection. The medical or surgical management of an interstitial pregnancy depends on the patient's hemodynamic stability considering the rupture of the pregnancy. Interstitial pregnancy is linked to elevated morbidity. Early diagnosis and adequate management both can avoid its catastrophic outcomes."

The vast majority of primary lesions affect the uterus, with primarily extrauterine lesions being a rarity. Choriocarcinoma with an ongoing pregnancy is extremely rare because fetuses usually do not survive the third trimester. Case Report: We present a case of heterotopic tubal choriocarcinoma coexisting with a viable intrauterine pregnancy. A 30-year-old, 39-week pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 2) came to our hospital complaining of acute upper abdominal pain. During routine prenatal screening in the first trimester, no pathological ultrasound findings were detected. Similar abdominal pain episodes had been recorded at 18, 27, and 32 weeks of gestation, when patient was hospitalized for examination and observation, but the cause of symptoms at that time of gestation remained unclear. The patient underwent an emergency caesarean section due to severe abdominal pain and fetal compromise. She delivered a live male infant. During the surgery, around 1000 mL of blood clots were evacuated, and the excision of the right fallopian tube and masses, as well as the control of significant blood loss was performed. Postoperative serum beta-hCG was elevated to 139 482 IU/L, while imaging studies showed no metastasis. The histological examination of the excised tissue samples confirmed a diagnosis of tubal choriocarcinoma. With a FIGO score of 8, the patient received three courses of the EP/EMA regimen. After more than a year, the patient showed no radiographic signs of distant metastasis and is now in complete remission. Conclusions: This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of such extremely rare scenarios. Even though such cases are rare, it demonstrates the necessity for improved diagnostic measures to enhance patient outcomes in similar clinical situations."

Laboratory evaluation revealed she was pregnant with a serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) of 798 mIU/mL. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) revealed a single left tubal pregnancy with a yolk sac. The patient elected medical management with body surface area (BSA)-based intramuscular (IM) methotrexate (MTX). On Day 4, the patient returned to the ED; her b-hCG was 727 mIU/mL. TVUS revealed twin left tubal pregnancies with yolk sacs and fetal poles without cardiac activity. The patient elected to continue medical management with a second dose of BSA-based IM MTX. On Day 6, the patient returned to the ED with abdominal and rectal pain. She was hemodynamically stable without signs of an acute abdomen. Her b-hCG was 533 mIU/mL.

In order to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, it is necessary to integrate clinical presentation and the findings of imaging and laboratory examinations. Computed tomography findings, plasma d-dimer level, and the time from pain onset play a critical role in distinguishing ovarian necrosis. The efficiency of oophoropexy on preventing recurrent ovarian torsion is controversial. Most patients with early diagnosis of ovarian torsion may have a better prognosis with conservative surgery.

    "abstract": "Intern and junior emergency medicine residents. Abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy are common presentations to the emergency department (ED).1 Formal transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is considered the test of choice for evaluation of first trimester pregnancy due to its high sensitivity and specificity for identifying intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies.1 Additionally, TVUS can evaluate for various uterine and ovarian pathology as well as identify other non-gynecologic conditions and is within the scope of practice for the emergency physician.2 Given the emergent and time sensitive nature of certain obstetric and gynecologic conditions, formal transvaginal ultrasound imaging may not be feasible. A rapid assessment with transvaginal point-of-care ultrasound (TVPOCUS) can be utilized by emergency medicine physicians (EMP) to confirm intrauterine pregnancies (IUP) and identify any associated complications. There are multiple advantages to TVPOCUS including reduced cost and length of stay, patient satisfaction, and improved resource utilization.1,3 Additionally, multiple studies demonstrate that EMPs can learn this skill and perform TVPOCUS accurately and safely.1,3 Developing the skills and comfort with TVPOCUS in a simulation setting during residency is beneficial and can have important implications in future practice. By the end of the session, learners should be able to 1) recognize the clinical indications for transvaginal ultrasound in the ED, 2) practice the insertion, orientation, and sweeping motions used to perform a TVPOCUS study, 3) interpret transvaginal ultrasound images showing an IUP or alternative pathologies, and 4) understand proper barrier, disinfection, and storage techniques for endocavitary probes. This session included three high-fidelity simulation cases that allowed participants to utilize TVPOCUS in a safe and conducive environment. There was a total of 32 emergency medicine (EM) residents who participated. The simulation sessions were divided into two separate rooms and included four learners for each session that actively managed the patient, for a total of 12 active participants. The 20 remaining residents were observers. Participants learned evidence-based indications, performance, and interpretation of transvaginal ultrasound. Three cases were reviewed and included IUP, ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemorrhagic shock, and appendicitis in pregnancy. The cases were followed by a debriefing session and discussion regarding the evidence behind bedside transvaginal ultrasound, its incorporation into EM workflow, and practice-based learning. The educational content and efficacy were evaluated by oral feedback in a debriefing session after the workshop. Additionally, pre-simulation and post-simulation surveys were sent to participants to assess prior ultrasound experience and confidence on the indications, performance, and interpretation of transvaginal ultrasound. Responses were collected using a Likert scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being \"not at all confident\" and 5 being \"very confident.\" Ten learners responded to the survey consisting of EM residents in a three-year EM residency program. Prior to the workshop, the median reported confidence level across all questions was \"1- not at all confident\" for the PGY-1 class, and \"3-neutral\" for the PGY-2 and PGY-3 classes. Following the workshop, all median scores across all classes were \"4-confident,\" demonstrating an increase in confidence scoring across all measurements and participants. Incorporating transvaginal ultrasound into clinical workflow demonstrated the largest increase in confidence score (median 1.5 to 4), followed by insertion/orientation of the endocavitary probe (median 2.5 to 5). This high-fidelity simulation familiarized learners with transvaginal ultrasound and how it can be appropriately utilized for a variety of high-yield clinical scenarios that present regularly to the ED. Given the variation in ultrasound training among residency programs, and the lack of specific simulation content addressing this modality, it is important to implement scenarios that improve learner comfort with TVPOCUS. Overall, this workshop resulted in an increase in confidence scores of participants in the indication, performance, and interpretation of TVPOCUS in the ED.

The aim is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of treatment by hysteroscopic tissue removal system after systemic methotrexate injection. We report the case of a 27-year-old patient who had previously had a C-section and who presented herself to the emergency room with pelvic pain and metrorrhagia. The human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) serum level was positive. The exploration revealed an ectopic pregnancy on the cesarean scar. She benefited of 4 systemic injections of methotrexate. As the hCG became negative, endovaginal ultrasound confirmed the avascular nature of the mass. Surgical resection by mechanical morcellation hysteroscopy (TruClear™) was performed under general anaesthesia, visual control and ultrasound guidance. This procedure was successful. It was an ambulatory procedure and there were neither intra- nor postoperative complications. To our knowledge, this is the first time in Belgium that a hysteroscopic tissue removal system procedure has been used to treat a caesarean scar pregnancy. This technique seems to be safe for both the patient and the surgeon and could become a new approach for cesarean scar pregnancy management.

Right ovary could not be discerned separately. Emergency laparotomy with hysterectomy and right adnexal clearance was done. Histopathology showed complete ectopic hydatidiform mole. USG remains the modality of choice for initial assessment of suspected GTD and it allows reliable evaluation of residual or recurrent disease.

    "abstract": "Pediatric ovarian torsion (OT) is an emergency condition that remains challenging to diagnose because of its overall unspecific clinical presentation. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of clinical, ultrasound, and inflammatory laboratory markers in pediatric OT. We performed a retrospective multicentric case-control study in patients with clinical and ultrasound suspicion of OT, in whom surgical examination was performed between 2016-2022 in seven pediatric hospitals. Patients were divided into two groups according to intraoperative findings: OT group (ovarian torsion), defined as torsion of the ovarian axis at least 360°, and non-OT group (no torsion). Demographics, clinical, ultrasound, and laboratory features at admission were analyzed. The diagnostic yield analysis was performed using logistic regression models, and the results were represented by ROC curves. We included a total of 110 patients (75 in OT group; 35 in non-OT group), with no demographic or clinical differences between them. OT-group patients had shorter time from symptom onset (8 vs. 12 h; p = 0.023), higher ultrasound median ovarian volume (63 vs. 51 mL; p = 0.013), and a significant increase in inflammatory markers (leukocytes, neutrophils, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein) when compared to the non-OT group. In the ROC curve analysis, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) presented the highest AUC (0.918), with maximum sensitivity (92.4%) and specificity (90.1%) at the cut-off point NLR = 2.57. NLR can be considered as a useful predictor of pediatric OT in cases with clinical and ultrasound suspicion. Values above 2.57 may help to anticipate urgent surgical treatment in these patients."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pregnancies are a rare form of ectopic pregnancy with omentum pregnancies being even rarer. Ectopic pregnancy should be diagnosed and terminated early to prevent the risk of harm to the mother. This case report describes a rare case of omentum pregnancy with severe hemoperitoneum. The patient had not visited a doctor until she failed to menstruate for 3 months, by which point she had developed severe hypogastralgia. The patient was diagnosed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy after ultrasonography. The omentum pregnancy was complicated by severe hemoperitoneum, which was confirmed by emergency laparotomy. The patient was treated successfully with fetal extraction and partial omentectomy. Ultrasound examination in early pregnancy is essential to detect and treat ectopic pregnancies as early as possible, as surgery is usually required for abdominal pregnancies. Prompt treatment of ectopic pregnancies is critical, as an omentum pregnancy is dangerous and may result in severe intraperitoneal bleeding."

    "abstract": "Postnatal management of antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts is not well-defined. The clinical course, management, and outcomes of patients with antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts were reviewed. Infants <1 year of age with antenatally diagnosed ovarian cyst managed at The Hospital for Sick Children between January 2017 and December 2021 were included. Patient charts were reviewed for postnatal ultrasound (US) images, management, clinical course and complications. Mixed linear regression analysis was used to model the change in cyst size over time. In total, 52 patients were included and 10 patients had no cyst identified at their first postnatal US. Of the remaining cases, 36% were simple/physiologic and 64% had complex features. Two underwent percutaneous aspiration while 40 patients were managed expectantly with most cysts (62%) resolving. The rate of resolution was significantly higher and faster for simple compared to complex cysts (84% versus 52%, p < 0.05). Cysts that persisted at the end of the study period (n = 14) had all decreased in size, with a rate of resolution similar to resolved cysts. Only one patient managed expectantly required urgent laparoscopy for salpingoophorectomy. Antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts exhibit high rates of resolution with expectant management, supporting the safety and efficacy for expectant management for these patients. III."

To review systemic MTX therapy use in the first trimester of pregnancy in our hospital and to examine subsequent clinical outcomes. Retrospective review of all women treated with systemic MTX in early pregnancy identified from electronic prescription records from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020 at Cork University Maternity Hospital, Ireland. Relevant data was transcribed from electronic health records. Indications for treatment were tubal ectopic pregnancy (70%, n = 51), persistent pregnancy of unknown location (22%, n = 16) and caesarean scar pregnancy (7%, n = 5). Treatment was successful in 88% (n = 44) of tubal ectopic pregnancies with 73% (n = 37) and 14% (n = 7) of women receiving a single dose and repeated doses, respectively. Only 8% (n = 4) of tubal ectopic pregnancies required emergency surgery for subsequent tubal rupture. In 93% (n = 15) of cases of persistent pregnancy of unknown location, treatment was successful with one patient requiring uterine evacuation. Women with caesarean scar pregnancy were treated with combined MTX and uterine evacuation without complication. The efficacy of medical treatment with systemic MTX for confirmed tubal ectopic pregnancy in our hospital is in line with national and international standards. Careful consideration should be given to treating caesarean scar pregnancy and persistent pregnancy of unknown location with systemic MTX. Systemic MTX use guided by clinicians specialised in early pregnancy complications and safe medication practices may improve treatment success and reduce adverse events."

    "abstract": "We describe the case of a woman with mild endometriosis and Allen-Masters syndrome after in vitro fertilisation (IVF), presenting at 7 weeks 2 days gestation with abdominal pain. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a gestational sac with a non-viable fetus near the right ovary. Laparoscopy was performed due to escalating abdominal pain which revealed a ruptured ectopic pregnancy at the right uterosacral ligament (USL) and blood in the pouch of Douglas. A peritoneal incision along the USL facilitated drainage and removal of the ectopic pregnancy. A pathological investigation described the presence of endometrial tissue directly adjacent to products of conception, which suggested a retroperitoneal implantation that may have been facilitated by the presence of an endometriotic lesion. This case underscores the distinctive clinical trajectory of unconventional ectopic pregnancies, provides novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of ectopic implantation and underscores the crucial role of comprehensive patient assessment during IVF and subsequent pregnancy in ensuring effective management."

    "abstract": "The most common twin ectopic pregnancy is heterotopic (1/7000). We are reporting a rare case of twin tubo-ovarian ectopic pregnancy, which was presented in the emergency department of Ayub Teaching Hospital Abbottabad. A 30- year-old female arrived with worsening lower abdominal pain persisting for three weeks. She also had per-vaginal bleeding with passage of clots 1week ago. Clinical examination revealed a tense abdomen with tenderness in the left iliac fossa. Per-vaginally, there was cervical motion tenderness and fullness in the posterior fornix. Beta HCG level revealed a sub-optimal rise whereas Transabdominal ultrasound showed an echogenic shadow in the left ovary. The uterus appeared normal. On exploratory laparotomy a large left ovarian mass was seen with ruptured chronic right tubal pregnancy with adhesions. On cut-section of the ovary, a small foetus was evident. We have concluded that in case of subacute abdominal pain and an-echogenic mass on ultrasonography in reproductive age contralateral adnexa should be accessed to exclude contralateral ectopic pregnancy."

We present a case of BTP in a 25-year-old primigravid woman with a history of infertility due to polycystic ovarian syndrome. She was receiving letrozole when she presented with severe abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Initial evaluation revealed a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the right fallopian tube, prompting an emergency laparotomy. During surgery, a second intact ectopic mass was discovered in the left fallopian tube, highlighting the diagnostic complexity of BTP. Management involved a salpingectomy on the right side and salpingostomy on the left to preserve fertility. This case underscores the importance of considering BTP in the differential diagnosis of ectopic pregnancies and the necessity for thorough preoperative imaging studies, namely ultrasonography and surgical exploration, to prevent missed diagnoses. BTP is a rare and challenging clinical entity that requires a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management. Early recognition, prompt intervention, and close surveillance are essential to mitigate the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality associated with this condition."

    "abstract": "In the milieu of emergency medicine, pelvic and lower abdominal pain present recurrently, with ovarian torsion posing a formidable diagnostic quandary amid multifarious etiologies. Given the burgeoning reliance on CT in acute care settings, it invariably assumes primacy as the principal imaging modality. This study endeavors to elucidate the CT imaging manifestations encountered by surgically confirmed ovarian torsion patients and utilizing CT to differentiate necrosis. A retrospective analysis (January, 2015- April, 2019) utilizing hospital archives was conducted on patients diagnosed with ovarian torsion, post-surgery. Inclusion criteria encompassed patients who underwent CT examinations within one week of diagnosis. A large array of CT findings encompassing midline orientation, uterine deviation, intraovarian hematoma/mass, and multiple others were systematically documented. 90 patients were diagnosed with ovarian torsion- 53 (59%) had CT within one week of diagnosis, 41(77%) underwent a CT with IV contrast and 12 (23%) without IV contrast. Mean age was 43 years (range 19-77 years), with near equal distribution of involvement of each ovary. Mean maximum ovarian diameter was 11.7 ± 6.3 cm (4.2-34.8 cm). Most common imaging features include the presence of thickened pedicle (43/53, 81%), midline ovary (41/53, 77%), presence of thickened fallopian tube (31/49, 63%), and ipsilateral uterine deviation (33/53, 62%). Based on contemporaneous imaging report, torsion was diagnosed in 25/ 53 studies giving a sensitivity of 47%. Enlarged ovarian dimensions (> 3.0 cm), thickened vascular pedicle or fallopian tube, midline ovarian disposition with ipsilateral uterine deviation, and the presence of a whirlpool sign emerged as predominant CT imaging features in surgically confirmed ovarian torsion cases, serving as pivotal diagnostic aides for radiologists. Concomitant pelvic free fluid and intraovarian hematoma signify necrotic changes, indicative of ischemic severity and disease progression."

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) is one of the most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) worldwide. Chlamydia can cause long term complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic pregnancy (EP) and tubal factor infertility (TFI). Changing testing strategies, for example reduced asymptomatic testing, influence chlamydia surveillance, highlighting the need for exploring alternative ways of monitoring chlamydia. We investigated the possibility of introducing routine surveillance of chlamydia related long term complications. A qualitative study including 15 in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of gynaecologists, general practitioners (GP), sexual health and emergency doctors was conducted in the Netherlands in 2021-2022. A semi-structured interview guide focused on experiences with diagnosis and registration of PID, EP and TFI and how a change in asymptomatic chlamydia testing strategy might influence this. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using a thematic approach. Analysis showed that gynaecologists most frequently reported diagnosing PID, EP and TFI. Other professions rarely diagnose these complications, with emergency doctors only diagnosing EP. Most respondents reported unique registration codes for PID and EP, but the coding for TFI is more ambiguous. They reflected that diagnosis and registration of PID, EP and TFI are handled differently within their professions. Most respondents acknowledged registration in diagnostic codes as a useful surveillance tool. They expressed concerns in representativeness (e.g. differences in interpretation of diagnosis criteria) and data quality for surveillance. Patient files of gynaecologists are likely to be most complete for monitoring trends of diagnosed chlamydia related long term complications in the Netherlands. However, when establishing a chlamydia complication surveillance system, professionals should be engaged in further standardizing diagnosis and registration practices. This will improve the quality and interpretability of complication surveillance and facilitate comparison between countries."

    "abstract": "To explore the clinical value of ultrasound examination in evaluating the presence of ovarian torsion in female infants with inguinal ovarian hernia. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 91 cases of ovarian hernia diagnosed by ultrasonography at our institution. Among them, 6 cases were identified as ovarian strangulation, while 85 cases were classified as non-ovarian strangulation. All cases underwent high-frequency ultrasound examination. We analyzed whether there were differences in the associated factors between the two groups and compared the disparities in the urgency of surgery between the two groups. Significant differences were observed between the ovarian strangulation group and the non- strangulation group in terms of ovarian volume, ovarian blood flow, and the presence of incarceration. The need for emergency surgery was significantly associated with the presence of incarceration and ovarian torsion. Ultrasound has good clinical value in diagnosing ovarian hernia and determining the presence of ovarian strangulation. It can assist clinical physicians in determining the timing of surgery for children with ovarian hernia."

    "abstract": "Gynecological emergencies can often present with a myriad of non-specific signs and symptoms, posing a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. They can be grossly divided into uterine or adnexal pathologies. Uterine pathologies can be secondary to intracavitary accumulation of blood [like in patients with transverse vaginal septum, Robert's uterus, accessory and cavitated uterine mass, unicornuate uterus with contralateral non-communicating functional horn], bleeding per vaginum [like in patients with retained products of conception, enhanced myometrial vascularity], pyometra [secondary to pelvic inflammatory disease, cervical obstruction secondary to benign and malignant causes] or complications of fibroids [like red degeneration, torsion of subserosal fibroid]. The adnexal pathologies can range from ectopic pregnancy in a urine pregnancy test (UPT) positive patient to haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, ruptured dermoid cyst and tubo-ovarian abscess in a UPT negative patient. Multimodality imaging including ultrasound (USG), computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can narrow down the differentials and help in formulating an accurate diagnosis. The objective of this article is to familiarize the readers with multimodality imaging findings in common as well as uncommon acute gynecological emergencies and provide an algorithmic imaging approach for acute gynecological emergencies. USG is typically used as the first line diagnostic modality in diagnosis of acute gynecological emergencies. CT scan & MRI are helpful as a problem-solving tool in acute gynecological emergencies when USG findings are indeterminate."

Here in, we present a case of a 27-year-old primeparous women who presented at 18 weeks with features of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Initial ultrasonographic imaging showed an intrauterine pregnancy corresponding to 18 weeks. It also revealed a floating fetus with significant collection of fluid in the pouch of Douglas, retroceacal recess and both hepatocellular recess. An emergency explorative laparotomy was done where right salpingectomy was performed. She was later followed up to term and delivered by elective cesarean section successfully. A brief narrative of the challenges in the management, clinical presentation and limitation in the management is highlighted in the present case report. Key message: Heterotopic pregnancy can occur in natural conception irrespective of usage of ovulation induction. Routine early pregnancy ultrasound can promote early detection with prompt surgical intervention to mitigate its complications."

Upon arrival, her vital signs were normal, but she was moderately obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 38.8 kg/m2. She displayed tenderness during abdominal examination and cervical motion tenderness. Her blood test results showed no significant abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a translocated part of intrauterine device to the cervix and transvaginal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a hypoechoic complex structure in the left adnexa, measuring 53 mm, alongside free fluid in Morrison's pouch.

Hospital protocols requiring a specific beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level to qualify for diagnostic testing (pelvic ultrasound) can delay diagnosis and treatment. In this study we sought to determine the relationship between β-hCG level and the size of ectopic pregnancy with associated outcomes. We performed a retrospective case review of patients diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy in an urban, academic emergency department specializing in obstetrical care, from January 1, 2015-December 31, 2017. Variables extracted included presentation, treatment, adverse outcomes, and rates of rupture. We identified 519 unique ectopic pregnancies. Of those ectopic pregnancies, 22.9% presented with evidence of rupture on ultrasound, and 14.4% showed evidence of hemodynamic instability (pulse >100 beats per minute; systolic blood pressure <90 millimeters of mercury; or evidence of significant blood loss) on presentation. Medical management outcomes were as follows: of 177 patients who received single-dose methotrexate, 14.7% failed medical management and required surgical intervention; of 46 who received multi-dose methotrexate, 36.9% failed medical management and required surgical intervention. Ultimately, 55.7% of patients required operative management of their ectopic pregnancy. Mean β-hCG level at initial presentation was 7,096 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL) (SD 88,872 mIU/mL) with a median of 1,289 mIU/mL; 50.4% of ectopic pregnancies presented with β-hCG levels less than the standard discriminatory zone of 1,500 mIU/mL. Additionally, 44% of the patients who presented with evidence of rupture had β-hCG levels less than 1,500 mIU/mL. Comparison of size of ectopic pregnancy (based on maximum dimension in millimeters) to β-hCG levels revealed a very weak correlation (r = 0.144, P < .001), and detection of ectopic pregnancies by ultrasound was independent of β-hCG levels. Levels of β-hCG do not correlate with the presence or size of an ectopic pregnancy, indicating need for diagnostic imaging regardless of β-hCG level in patients with clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancy. Almost one-sixth of patients presented with evidence of hemodynamic instability, and approximately one quarter of patients presented with evidence of rupture requiring emergent operative management. Ultimately, more than half of patients required an operative procedure to definitively manage their ectopic pregnancy."

Its Risk factors include previous ectopic pregnancies, cesarean section, smoking, pelvic inflammatory disease, using intrauterine devices (IUD), and assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs). Accurate diagnosis of rectal ectopic pregnancy remains challenging due to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. A 25-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of unresponsive lower abdominal pain and nausea. Ultrasound imaging revealed a normal-sized uterus with endometrial thickness, fluids, and clots in the abdominal cavity, but no intrauterine gestational sac was detected. Based on the clinical presentation, ectopic pregnancy was suspected. During laparotomy, the placenta and fetal tissue remnants were found on the anterior wall of the upper third of the rectum. Abdominal ectopic pregnancy is a high-risk condition that can manifest with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, as well as abdominal and pelvic pain. These variable symptoms underscore the importance of considering rectal ectopic pregnancy as a differential diagnosis and ruling it out to prevent life-threatening complications, including severe bleeding. Due to its rarity, diverse presentation, and similarity to other conditions, diagnosing rectal ectopic pregnancy and determining the appropriate management can be challenging. Physicians should be aware of this specific type of ectopic pregnancy to enable early-stage diagnosis and provide optimal care."

    "abstract": "The primary aim was to validate the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) benign simple descriptors (BDs) followed by the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model, if BDs cannot be applied, in a two-step strategy to classify adnexal masses identified during pregnancy. The secondary aim was to describe the natural history of adnexal masses during pregnancy. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from women with an adnexal mass identified on ultrasonography during pregnancy between 2017 and 2022 at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London, UK. Clinical and ultrasound data were extracted from medical records and ultrasound software. Adnexal masses were classified and managed according to expert subjective assessment (SA). Borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) were classified as malignant. BDs were applied retrospectively to classify adnexal masses, and if BDs were not applicable, the ADNEX model (using a risk- of-malignancy threshold ≥ 10%) was used, in a two-step strategy. The reference standard was histology (where available) or expert SA at the postnatal ultrasound scan. A total of 291 women with a median age of 33 (interquartile range (IQR), 29-36) years presented with an adnexal mass during pregnancy, at a median gestational age of 12 (IQR, 8-17) weeks. Of those, 267 (91.8%) were followed up to the postnatal period. Based on the reference standard, 4.1% (11/267) of adnexal masses were classified as malignant (all BOTs) and 95.9% (256/267) as benign. BDs were applicable in 68.9% (184/267) of adnexal masses; of these, only one (0.5%) BOT was misclassified as benign. The ADNEX model was used to classify the 83 residual masses and misclassified 3/10 (30.0%) BOTs as benign and 25/73 (34.2%) benign masses as malignant, of which 13/25 (52.0%) were classified as decidualized endometrioma on expert SA. The two-step strategy had a specificity of 90.2%, sensitivity of 63.6%, negative predictive value of 98.3% and positive predictive value of 21.9%. A total of 56 (21.0%) women underwent surgical intervention: four (1.5%) as an emergency during pregnancy, four (1.5%) electively during Cesarean section and 48 (18.0%) postnatally. During follow-up, 64 (24.0%) adnexal masses resolved spontaneously. Cyst-related complications occurred in four (1.5%) women during pregnancy (ovarian torsion, n = 2; cyst rupture, n = 2) and six (2.2%) women in the postnatal period (all ovarian torsion). Overall, 196/267 (73.4%) women had a persistent adnexal mass at postnatal ultrasound. Presumed decidualization occurred in 31.1% (19/61) of endometriomas and had resolved in 89.5% (17/19) by the first postnatal ultrasound scan. BDs apply to most adnexal masses during pregnancy. However, the small number of malignant tumors in this cohort (4.1%) restricted the evaluation of the ADNEX model, so expert SA should be used to classify adnexal masses during pregnancy when BDs do not apply. A larger multicenter prospective study is required to evaluate the use of the ADNEX model to classify adnexal masses during pregnancy. Our data suggest that most adnexal masses can be managed expectantly during pregnancy, given the high rate of spontaneous resolution and low risk of complications. © 2024 The Author(s).

Evaluación del uso de la estrategia internacional de análisis de tumores ováricos en dos pasos para clasificar masas anexiales identificadas en el embarazo: un estudio piloto. El objetivo principal fue validar los descriptores benignos (DB) simples del Análisis Internacional de Tumores Ováricos (IOTA, por sus siglas en inglés) seguidos de la Evaluación de Diferentes Neoplasias en el modelo adneXa (ADNEX), si no se pueden aplicar los DB, en una estrategia de dos pasos para clasificar las masas anexiales identificadas durante el embarazo. El objetivo secundario fue describir el historial natural de las masas anexiales durante el embarazo. Se realizó un análisis retrospectivo de datos recopilados prospectivamente de mujeres con una masa anexial identificada en la ecografía durante el embarazo entre 2017 y 2022 en el hospital Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea de Londres (Reino Unido). Los datos clínicos y ecográficos se obtuvieron de los historiales clínicos y del programa informático de ecografía. Las masas anexiales se clasificaron y trataron según la evaluación subjetiva (ES) por expertos. Los tumores ováricos limítrofes (TOL) se clasificaron como malignos. Los DB se aplicaron retrospectivamente para clasificar las masas anexiales, y si los DB no eran aplicables, se utilizó el modelo ADNEX (utilizando un umbral de riesgo de malignidad ≥10%), en una estrategia de dos pasos. El estándar de referencia fue la histología (cuando estaba disponible) o la ES por expertos en ecografía postnatal. Un total de 291 mujeres con una mediana de edad de 33 años (rango intercuartílico [RIQ], 29–36) presentaron una masa anexial durante el embarazo, a una mediana de edad gestacional de 12 semanas (RIQ, 8–17). De ellas, a 267 (91,8%) se les dio seguimiento hasta el periodo postnatal. Según el estándar de referencia, el 4,1% (11/267) de las masas anexiales se clasificaron como malignas (todas TOL) y el 95,9% (256/267) como benignas. Los DB fueron aplicables al 68,9% (184/267) de las masas anexiales; de éstas, sólo un TOL (0,5%) se clasificó erróneamente como benigno. Se utilizó el modelo ADNEX para clasificar las 83 masas residuales y se clasificaron 3/10 (30,0%) TOL como benignas y 25/73 (34,2%) masas benignas como malignas, de las cuales 13/25 (52,0%) se clasificaron como endometrioma decidualizado en la ES por expertos. La estrategia en dos pasos tuvo una especificidad del 90,2%, una sensibilidad del 63,6%, un valor predictivo negativo del 98,3% y un valor predictivo positivo del 21,9%. Un total de 56 (21,0%) mujeres se sometieron a una intervención quirúrgica: cuatro (1,5%) como urgencia durante el embarazo, cuatro (1,5%) de forma electiva durante una cesárea y 48 (18,0%) en el posparto. Durante el seguimiento, 64 (24,0%) masas anexiales se resolvieron espontáneamente. Se produjeron complicaciones relacionadas con quistes en cuatro (1,5%) mujeres durante el embarazo (torsión ovárica, n=2; rotura de quiste, n=2) y en seis (2,2%) mujeres en el periodo postnatal (todas torsión ovárica). En total, 196/267 (73,4%) mujeres presentaban una masa anexial persistente en la ecografía postnatal. La presunta decidualización se produjo en el 31,1% (19/61) de los endometriomas y el 89,5% (17/19) se habían resuelto en la primera ecografía postnatal. Los DB aplican a la mayoría de las masas anexiales durante el embarazo. Sin embargo, el escaso número de tumores malignos en esta cohorte (4,1%) restringió la evaluación del modelo ADNEX, por lo que cuando no apliquen los DB debería recurrirse a la ES por expertos para clasificar las masas anexiales durante el embarazo. Se requiere un estudio prospectivo multicéntrico más amplio para evaluar el uso del modelo ADNEX para clasificar las masas anexiales durante el embarazo. Los datos de este estudio sugieren que la mayoría de las masas anexiales pueden tratarse de forma expectante durante el embarazo, dada la alta tasa de resolución espontánea y el bajo riesgo de complicaciones. 评估使用国际卵巢肿瘤研究组两步策略对妊娠期发现的附件肿块进行分类:试点研究 主要目的是先验证国际卵巢肿瘤研究组(IOTA)的良性简单描述符(BD)，如果无法应用BD，则使用多元附件肿瘤评估模型ADNEX， 分两步对妊娠期间发现的附件肿块进行分类。第二目的是描述妊娠期间附件肿块的自然病史。 本研究为对英国伦敦夏洛特女王和切尔西医院(Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital) 2017 年至 2022 年期间前瞻性收集的孕期超声检查发现附件肿块的妇女数据进行的回顾性分析。临床和超声数据均从医疗记录和超声软件中提取。附件肿块根据专家主观评估(SA)进行分类和管理。卵巢交界性肿瘤(BOT)被归类为恶性肿瘤。回顾性应用 BD 对附件肿块进行分类，如果 BD 不适用，则采用 ADNEX 模型(恶性风险阈值≥10%)，分两步进行。参考标准为组织学检查(如有)或产后超声扫描的专家SA。 共有 291 名中位数年龄为 33 岁(四分位距(IQR)为 29‐36 岁)的妇女在妊娠期间出现附件肿块，中位数孕周为 12 周(IQR 为 8‐17 周)。其中 267 人(91.8%)接受了产后随访。根据参考标准，4.1%(11/267)的附件肿块被归类为恶性(均为 BOT)，95.9%(256/267)被归类为良性。68.9%(184/267)的附件肿块适用 Bd；其中只有 1 例(0.5%)BOT 被误判为良性。使用 ADNEX 模型对剩余 83 例肿块进行分类，其中 3/10(30.0%)例 BOT 被归类为良性，25/73(34.2%)例良性肿块被归类为恶性，其中 13/25(52.0%)例根据专家 SA 被归类为蜕膜化子宫内膜异位。两步法的特异性为 90.2%，敏感性为 63.6%，阴性预测值为 98.3%，阳性预测值为 21.9%。共有 56 名(21.0%)妇女接受了手术治疗:其中 4 名(1.5%)是孕期急诊，4 名(1.5%)是剖宫产期间选择性治疗，48 名(18.0%)是产后治疗。在随访期间，64 例(24.0%)附件肿块自行消退。有 4 名(1.5%)妇女在孕期发生了与囊肿相关的并发症(卵巢扭转，2 例；囊肿破裂，2 例)，有 6 名(2.2%)妇女在产后发生了与囊肿相关的并发症(均为卵巢扭转)。总体而言，196/267(73.4%)名妇女在产后超声检查中发现有持续性附件肿块。31.1%(19/61)的子宫内膜异位症推断发生了蜕膜化，89.5%(17/19)的子宫内膜异位症在产后第一次超声检查时已经消退。 BD 适用于孕期的大多数附件肿块。然而，由于本队列中恶性肿瘤的数量较少(4.1%)，限制了对 ADNEX 模型的评估，因此当 BD 不适用时，应使用专家 SA 对孕期附件肿块进行分类。需要进行更大规模的多中心前瞻性研究，以评估使用 ADNEX 模型对孕期附件肿块进行分类的效果。我们的数据表明，鉴于附件肿块的自行消退率高且并发症风险低，大多数妊娠期附件肿块可作期待治疗。"

    "title": "Visibility and Size of the Pancreatic Duct and Common Bile Duct on Routine 2D MRI Sequences in Children Without Pancreaticobiliary Disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND. Pancreatic duct (PD) or common bile duct (CBD) dilatation can indicate ductal pathology, but limited data describe normal pediatric duct measurements on routine 2D MRI sequences. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to characterize the visibility and diameter of the PD and CBD on 2D MR images in children without pancreaticobiliary disease. METHODS. This retrospective study included patients who underwent abdominal MRI using a rapid protocol (composed of noncontrast axial and coronal 2D SSFSE sequences) to assess for suspected appendicitis or ovarian torsion in the emergency department setting between January 23, 2023, and September 13, 2023, and excluded patients with a pancreatic or hepatobiliary abnormality on MRI or laboratory assessment. Four pediatric radiologists independently reviewed examinations. Reviewers recorded PD visibility in each of four segments (i.e., head, neck, body, and tail) and CBD visibility, and reviewers measured PD diameter in each segment and maximal CBD diameter. Duct measurements by age were characterized by linear regression analyses. RESULTS. The study included 177 patients (112 female patients, 65 male patients; mean age, 12.3 ± 3.4 [SD] years [age range, 5.1-17.7 years]). The observers reported PD visibility in the head in 35.6-94.9% of patients, neck in 18.6-72.3%, body in 22.6-89.8%, and tail in 7.3-26.0% and reported PD visibility in all four segments in 6.2-22.6% of patients. Maximum PD diameter in any segment, as a mean across observers, was 1.8 mm (range across observers, 0.7-3.5 mm). The expected maximal PD diameter in any segment, in terms of the 5th and 95th percentile values of observers' mean measurements, was 1.4-2.3 mm; the prediction interval's upper limit increased from age 5 to age 17 from 2.1 to 2.5 mm. All observers reported CBD visibility in all patients. The mean CBD diameter across observers was 3.1 mm (range across observers, 2.9-3.4 mm). The expected CBD diameter, in terms of the 5th and 95th percentile values of observers' mean measurements, was 2.3-4.9 mm; the prediction interval's upper limit increased from age 5 to age 17 from 3.9 to 5.0 mm. CONCLUSION. We report expected upper limits for PD and CBD measurements on 2D MR images in children without evidence of pancreaticobiliary disease. CLINICAL IMPACT. These findings may aid radiologists' identification of pancreaticobiliary duct abnormalities on routine abdominal MRI examinations."

    "title": "Diagnostic utility of clinicodemographic, biochemical and metabolite variables to identify viable pregnancies in a symptomatic cohort during early gestation.",
    "abstract": "A significant number of pregnancies are lost in the first trimester and 1-2% are ectopic pregnancies (EPs). Early pregnancy loss in general can cause significant morbidity with bleeding or infection, while EPs are the leading cause of maternal mortality in the first trimester. Symptoms of pregnancy loss and EP are very similar (including pain and bleeding); however, these symptoms are also common in live normally sited pregnancies (LNSP). To date, no biomarkers have been identified to differentiate LNSP from pregnancies that will not progress beyond early gestation (non-viable or EPs), defined together as combined adverse outcomes (CAO). In this study, we present a novel machine learning pipeline to create prediction models that identify a composite biomarker to differentiate LNSP from CAO in symptomatic women. This prospective cohort study included 370 participants. A single blood sample was prospectively collected from participants on first emergency presentation prior to final clinical diagnosis of pregnancy outcome: LNSP, miscarriage, pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) or tubal EP (tEP). Miscarriage, PUL and tEP were grouped together into a CAO group. Human chorionic gonadotrophin β (β-hCG) and progesterone concentrations were measured in plasma. Serum samples were subjected to untargeted metabolomic profiling. The cohort was randomly split into train and validation data sets, with the train data set subjected to variable selection. Nine metabolite signals were identified as key discriminators of LNSP versus CAO. Random forest models were constructed using stable metabolite signals alone, or in combination with plasma hormone concentrations and demographic data. When comparing LNSP with CAO, a model with stable metabolite signals only demonstrated a modest predictive accuracy (0.68), which was comparable to a model of β-hCG and progesterone (0.71). The best model for LNSP prediction comprised stable metabolite signals and hormone concentrations (accuracy = 0.79). In conclusion, serum metabolite levels and biochemical markers from a single blood sample possess modest predictive utility in differentiating LNSP from CAO pregnancies upon first presentation, which is improved by variable selection and combination using machine learning. A diagnostic test to confirm LNSP and thus exclude pregnancies affecting maternal morbidity and potentially life-threatening outcomes would be invaluable in emergency situations."

    "abstract": "Torsion occurs as a complication in 10% of cases of ovarian tumors. It predominantly occurs in benign ones, while malignant tumors are less prone to torsion. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors are highly unusual sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary, accounting for less than 0.2% of all ovarian cancers. A 39-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor diagnosed due to ovarian torsion. The clinical presentation was characterized by abdominal pain. Ultrasound indicated signs of torsion, and torsion of the right ovary was subsequently confirmed during laparotomy. A salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, and histological examination revealed a moderately differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors often present with hormone-related or non-hormonal symptoms. Surgery plays a crucial role in both diagnosis and treatment. Postoperative treatment is not necessary for well-differentiated Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors in stage IA-IB. However, patients with grade 2-3 disease, advanced stage, or heterologous elements may consider adjuvant treatment. As these tumors are rare, this case contributes to the documentation of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, with a case diagnosed due to ovarian torsion. The case highlights the importance of establishing international registries of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor cases for standardized management."

    "abstract": "To report an uncommon case of primary OP treated laparoscopically. Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is the leading cause of maternal mortality during the first trimester and the incidence increases with assisted reproductive techniques, occurring in approximately 1.5%-2.1% of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization.1 Omental pregnancy (OP) is an extremely rare form of EP accounting for less than 1% of all EPs. OP can be classified as primary or secondary on the basis of Studdiford's criteria2. The preoperative diagnosis of OP is complex and usually occur in acute circumstances during a throughout intraoperative evaluation of the abdomen.3-5 A delayed diagnosis poses a serious threat to the survival of the patient; therefore, it is important to remark that EP can exist in unusual locations and prompt surgical intervention may be necessary. A step-by-step narrated video of a rare clinical case and description of the surgical procedure. Tertiary Level Academic Hospital \"IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero - Universitaria di Bologna\" Bologna, Italy. A 36-year-old woman was referred to our emergency room because of acute abdominal pain and nausea for 2 hours with no signs of hemodynamic instability. The patient also complained that poor vaginal bleeding appeared during the last 24 hours. The patient has undergone a cycle of in vitro fertilization with an elective single frozen embryo transfer of a blastocyst on day 5, 2 months before. She had no relevant clinical or surgical history. Diffuse abdominal tenderness and a painful uterus at mobilization were appreciated at clinical examination. A massive hemoperitoneum was diagnosed using transvaginal-transabdominal ultrasound, and no uterine or adnexal lesions were identified. The β-human chronic gonadotropin level was 43.861 mIU/mL, and the hemoglobin value was 10.5 g/dL. On suspicion of a ruptured EP, after detailed counseling and the acquisition of informed consent, a laparoscopic exploration was planned. First, the hemoperitoneum was evacuated to allow visualization of the abdominal cavity. At pelvic inspection, no EP was found. Throughout the exploration of the abdominal cavity, a 4-cm bluish cystic mass of friable consistency was detected infiltrating the omentum and the mesentery. According to Studdiford's criteria, the diagnosis of a primary OP was established. A careful and complete excision of the ectopic implant was performed with an ultrasonic system and required a considerable hemostatic effort using bipolar energy, endoscopic clips, and mechanical compression. The postoperative course was uneventful. The β-human chronic gonadotropin levels gradually decreased to negative values within 29 days after surgery. Omental ectopic pregnancy can be successfully managed with a laparoscopic approach even in an emergency setting. Omental pregnancy can easily be overlooked, even by skilled surgeons, during laparoscopic exploration. It is mandatory that all peritoneal surfaces and the omentum be carefully inspected during surgery in patients without other signs of pelvic EP.We confirm that the patient included in this video gave consent for publication of the video and posting of the video online, including on social media, the journal website, scientific literature websites, and other applicable sites."

It is preferred by women or couples who have achieved their reproductive potential and do not desire pregnancy. BTL carries a low risk of method failure with a subsequent pregnancy which is likely to be ectopic. We present a case of two consecutive ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancies following an interval BTL. A 40-year-old female, with 7 living children, who previously underwent an interval BTL, presented with acute abdominal pain for 2 days and amenorrhea for 6 weeks. She was stable but had generalized abdominal tenderness, guarding and rebound tenderness, and cervical motion tenderness. Her urine HCG was positive, and a trans-abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a tender echo-complex right adnexal mass, free fluid in the Cul-de-sac, and an empty uterine cavity, consistent with a ruptured right ectopic pregnancy. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was done with findings of a ruptured right distal tube containing products of conception, hemoperitoneum, and previous tubal ligation and left salpingectomy. A right total salpingectomy was done, and the excised right tube containing the mass was sent for histological examination, which revealed chorionic villi and hemorrhagic vascular decidual tissue in the fallopian tube, features suggestive of tubal ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is an emergent diagnostic imaging modality to identify the bleeding site and survey the abdominal cavity. The diagnostic utility of CECT for ectopic pregnancy (EP) has not been well-investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of CECT findings in patients with EP and extract specific findings that could contribute to the identification of implantation sites. We conducted a retrospective study, reviewing suspected EP cases between April 2015 and March 2018 in our hospital. Clinical symptoms, blood test results, transvaginal sonography findings, and surgical and pathologic findings from the medical records were assessed. CECT images were evaluated by a certified radiologist and gynecologist retrospectively in consensus. The following were selected as positive findings for specific determination of the ectopic implantation site: the ectopic gestational sac, lateralization of the hemoperitoneum around the adnexa on either side, and extravascular leakage of the contrast agent outside the uterine cavity. CECT was performed in 41 women with an EP. The ectopic implantation site was detectable on CECT in 90.2% (37/41), whereas it was noted in 70.0% (32/41) on transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS). Of nine patients with an EP with an undetectable implantation site on TVS, six were positive for the specific determination of the ectopic implantation site on CECT. CECT has the potential to predict ectopic implantation sites with high-level sensitivity. As CECT is an urgent diagnostic imaging tool to be used in an emergent setting, it may be a good option for EP diagnosis when the availability of magnetic resonance imaging is limited."

    "abstract": "Rudimentary horn pregnancy (RHP) is a special type of ectopic pregnancy and its pathophysiological basis is an abnormal fusion of the bilateral accessory mesonephric duct during the embryonic period. If sonographers lack experience to this disease, it is easily to be misdiagnosed in the early period, which often leads to rupture of the pregnant horn and life-threatening bleeding. Therefore, a high index of vigilance is required. We present a case of a 27-year-old female who went to the department of emergency due to menopause, pelvic pain and elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (above 200,000 IU/L). Sonographic examination showed uterus only had the right horn and endometrium was thickened about 1.7 cm without gestational sac (GS) in the uterine cavity. Besides, a 3.5×3.0 cm GS was found between the left ovary and corpus uteri. RHP was suspected by sonographer, and the patient underwent laparoscopy. Obstetricians and gynecologists removed the rudimentary horn and the left fallopian tube. The patient made a good recovery and was soon discharged home after surgery. This article analyzed one case and summarized ultrasonic characteristics of RHP which may help to improve the early diagnosis of RHP. If necessary, other imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be combined to make a clear diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible."

Her radiology-performed ultrasound had revealed an \"intrauterine gestational sac\" along with an adnexal mass near the right ovary. The patient was not undergoing assisted-reproductive fertilization, nor did she have meaningful risk factors for heterotopic pregnancy. The patient was managed expectantly over the ensuing week to see whether the intrauterine fluid was a true gestational sac. After multiple repeat ED visits, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was made. Ultimately, the patient elected for surgical management of her ectopic pregnancy.

A 30 years-old woman gravida 3, para 4 with no symptoms presented to the hospital at 30 weeks gestation for a routine examination and misdiagnosed as an abdominal ectopic pregnancy. The pregnancy continued for approximately 35 weeks, when a ruptured rudimentary horn pregnancy was discovered accidently during an emergency surgery, the left fallopian tube and ovary and the ruptured rudimentary horn were removed. Unicornuate uterus is a result of abnormal or failed development of one of the paired müllerian ducts, Spontaneous abortion in women with rudimentary horn pregnancy may occurs in the first and second trimester. Rudimentary horn pregnancies are associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality, And because of the risk of life-threatening complications, early diagnosis before rupture is essential for the successful management and prevention of these complications. The diagnosis of most cases of rudimentary horn pregnancy is considered challenging, and could be diagnosed after rupture, during emergency surgery. Although rudimentary horn pregnancy mostly ends in the first and second trimester, in some cases it may continue until term and end with a live healthy child."

    "abstract": "Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) poses a multifaceted challenge in women's health, necessitating an integrated approach that addresses its diverse etiologies and clinical presentations. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics PALM-COEIN classification system provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis of AUB in non-pregnant women, based on clinical and imaging-based categorization of causes into structural (Polyps, Adenomyosis, Leiomyomas and Malignancy; PALM), and non-structural causes (Coagulopathies, Ovulatory disorders, primary Endometrial disorders, Iatrogenic and Not otherwise classified; COEIN). On the other hand, placental disorders, uterine rupture, ectopic pregnancy and retained products of conceptions are the main causes of uterine bleeding during pregnancy and in the peripartum period. Ultrasound is usually the first-line imaging technique for the differential diagnosis of causes of AUB. Computed Tomography may be useful if ultrasound findings are unclear, especially in emergency settings. Magnetic resonance imaging, when indicated, is an excellent second-line diagnostic tool for a better non-invasive characterization of the underlying cause of AUB. This pictorial review aims to illustrate the main causes of AUB from the point of view of diagnostic imaging and to show not-so-common cases that can be treated by means of interventional radiology."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) constitutes 1%-2% of all pregnancies and is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. The most common site of ectopic pregnancy is the ampulla. Ectopic ovarian pregnancy (EOP) is one of the rare events, with an incidence of 0.5%-3% of all pregnancies. The incidence is higher in intrauterine device users or assisted reproductive techniques. The precise aetiology and pathogenesis of EOP remain elusive. Clinically, EOP mirrors the presentation of tubal pregnancy or a ruptured luteal cyst, often leading to life-threatening hypovolemic shock. Transvaginal sonography is the primary diagnostic tool. Still pinpointing the exact location early on poses challenges, and it's usually misinterpreted as a tubo-ovarian mass, hemorrhagic cyst, or luteal cyst. Furthermore, while a suboptimal rise in serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels may indicate pregnancy, it doesn't definitively confirm EOP. Only histopathological examination offers a conclusive diagnosis. This paper discusses an EOP case in a young woman who experienced five months of amenorrhea and exhibited no traditional risk factors, underscoring the significant challenges inherent in preoperative diagnosis."

Due to insufficient data, a proper management of non-specific types remains a challenge for all gynecologists worldwide. Two child-bearing age women were hospitalized due to delayed menstruation and a urine pregnancy test was positive without a determination of intrauterine pregnancy. The first EP case was located at the pelvic wall which identified incidentally during laparoscopy for a presumed tubal ectopic pregnancy on ultrasonography throughout. The second EP case was found at the hepatic region due to intermittent pain rising from the right upper quadrant region and serial ultrasonic findings. In our management, both cases were successfully assessed by laparoscopy and laparotomy without requiring further intervention, respectively. An accurate diagnosis of EP location at liver and pelvic wall is totally difficult since its uncommon location. An initial assessment should be based on clinical symptoms and the treatment remains controversial. The surgical management including laparotomy and laparoscopy depends on clinical evaluation, experience of surgeon, and interdisciplinary team. Thus, these abnormal sites of ectopic pregnancy ought to take into consideration for all gynecologists in an emergency condition with a major hemorrhage. In reproductive age women, primary EP at liver and pelvic wall should be considered with high index of suspicion if intrauterine pregnancy is totally excluded. Timely diagnosis, rational management by surgical excision, and a multidisciplinary team can reduce substantially adverse outcomes."

    "abstract": "Routine ultrasound before medication abortion (MAB) may create an impediment to expanding abortion access. This study examines clinical outcomes of MAB without pretreatment ultrasound evaluation at Planned Parenthood health centers in multiple states. We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 23 US-based Planned Parenthood affiliates that provided MAB without pretreatment ultrasound for eligible patients from March 2020 to December 2021. Affiliates aggregated electronic health record data from MABs at ≤77 days gestation (based on self-report of last menstrual period) without a pretreatment ultrasound (N = 18,041). Among MABs with known outcomes (N = 9821), we calculated the incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for completed abortion, ongoing pregnancy, subsequent procedure, emergency department/hospital visits associated with MAB, ectopic pregnancies, and gestational duration greater than 77 days. Among MABs with known outcomes, 96.3% had a complete abortion (95% CI = 95.9%-96.7%), and 2.0% had an ongoing pregnancy (95% CI = 1.7%-2.3%). Four percent had a subsequent procedure (95% CI = 3.6%-4.4%), and 2.3% had a documented emergency department/hospital visit (95% CI = 2.0%-2.6%). Less than 1% had a confirmed ectopic pregnancy (0.15%, 95% CI = 0.09%-0.25%) and had a gestational duration later identified to be greater than 77 days (0.13%, 95% CI = 0.05%-0.29%). Our calculated incidence rates of clinical outcomes align with rates from the previous literature on MAB and from the emerging literature on MAB without pretreatment ultrasonography. Findings from this analysis suggest that MAB without pretreatment ultrasound is safe and effective for eligible patients. This large US study found that medication abortion without pretreatment ultrasonography results in similar clinical outcomes to prepandemic models that include pretreatment ultrasonography. Medication abortion without a pretreatment ultrasound may be adopted by abortion providers seeking to expand options for their patients as access to abortion continues to erode."

There were 133 cases of POCUS ultrasound and 254 cases of RP ultrasound. All cases had TAUS imaging performed. Median LOS for patients when POCUS was utilized was 207 min (IQR 151-294) and 258 min (IQR 208-328) for those only using RP ultrasound, p ≤ 0.001. In the POCUS cohort, 38% (95% CI 30%-46%) received TVUS, while 94% received TVUS in the RP cohort (95% CI 90%-96%), p ≤ 0.001. Patients seen by ED faculty with ultrasound specialty training had TVUS 53% of the time (95% CI 41%-65%), while those seen by other ED faculty had TVUS 79% (95% CI 74%-83%) of the time, p = 0.035. POCUS in early pregnancy is associated with a significant reduction in TVUS usage. We suspect that POCUS users elect not to pursue TVUS after an IUP is identified on TAUS, while technicians perform protocol-based TVUS irrespective of TAUS findings. Patients seen by ultrasound trained ED physicians are less likely to receive TVUS."

    "abstract": "In 2015, the U.S. News and World Report (USNWR) implemented a quality metric to expedite surgery for testicular torsion (TT), but not ovarian torsion (OT). This study examined OR timing among children with suspected TT and OT before and after this metric. A single-center retrospective cohort study of children (1-18yr) who underwent surgery for suspected gonadal torsion was performed. Time to OR (TTOR) from hospital presentation to surgery start was calculated. An interrupted time series analysis identified changes in TTOR for suspected TT versus OT after the 2015 USNWR quality metric. Overall, 216 patients presented with TT and 120 with OT. Median TTOR for TT was 147 min (IQR:99-198) versus 462 min (IQR:308-606) for OT. Post-quality metric, children with TT experienced a 27.8 min decrease (95% CI:-51.7,-3.9, p = 0.05) in annual median TTOR. No significant decrease was observed for children with OT (p = 0.22). Children with history of a known ovarian mass (N = 62) experienced a shorter TTOR compared to those without (422 vs 499min; p = 0.04). Implementation of a national quality metric for TT expedited surgical care for children with TT, but not children with OT. These findings highlight the need for equitable quality metrics for children presenting with suspected gonadal torsion. III. Retrospective Comparative Study, Observational Cohort Study."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) represents a severe gynecological emergency in female pediatric patients, necessitating immediate surgical intervention to prevent ovarian ischemia and preserve fertility. Prompt diagnosis is, therefore, paramount. This retrospective study set out to assess the utility of combined clinical, ultrasound, and laboratory features in diagnosing OT. The authors included 326 female pediatric patients aged under 14 years who underwent surgical confirmation of OT over a five-year period. Logistic regression analysis was employed to pinpoint factors linked with OT, and the authors compared clinical presentation, laboratory results, and ultrasound characteristics between patients with OT (OT group) and without OT (N-OT group). The authors conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to gauge the predictive capacity of the combined features. Among 326, OT was confirmed in 24.23 % (79 cases) of the patients. The OT group had a higher incidence of prenatal ovarian masses than the N-OT (22 cases versus 7 cases) (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the authors observed significant differences in the presence of lower abdominal pain, suspected torsion on transabdominal ultrasound, and a high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR > 3) between the OT and non-OT groups (p ˂ 0.05). Furthermore, when these parameters were combined, the resulting area under the curve (AUC) was 0.868, demonstrating their potential utility in OT diagnosis. This study demonstrates a prediction model integrating clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound findings that can support the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian torsion, thereby enhancing diagnostic precision and improving patient management. Future prospective studies should concentrate on developing clinical predictive models for OT in pediatric patients."

We compared outcomes of ovarian loss amongst pediatric patients. We conducted a retrospective review of 88 patients with adnexal torsion from March 2014 through April 2021. Rates of ovarian loss were compared for patients who underwent surgery within and beyond 60 minutes from diagnosis. Most patients underwent surgery more than 60 minutes from the time of diagnosis (83%; median time 116 minutes). Comparing patients with and without ovarian loss, there was no statistically significant difference in time to surgery from time of diagnosis (P = .618). Patients with ovarian loss had a longer duration of symptoms (24 vs 96 hours; P = .017). While surgical repair of adnexal torsion may be urgent, this study suggests that duration of symptoms should be considered when assessing a patient's likelihood of ovarian loss."

This study evaluated a second model, the M6NP model, which does not include the progesterone level at the initial visit. The main aim of this study was to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the M6NP model in a population of French women. Between January and December 2021, all women with an hCG measurement from the gynaecological emergency department of a teaching hospital were screened for inclusion in this study. Women with a pregnancy location determined before or at the second visit were excluded. The diagnostic test was based on logistic regression of the M6NP model, with classification into two groups: high risk of EP (≥5%) and low risk of EP (<5%). The reference test was the final outcome based on clinical, biological and sonographic results: failed PUL (FPUL), intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) or EP. Diagnostic performance for risk prediction of EP, and also IUP and FPUL, was calculated. In total, 759 women with possible PUL were identified. After screening, 341 women with PUL were included in the main analysis. Of these, 186 (54.5%) were classified as low risk, including three (1.6%) with a final outcome of EP. The remaining 155 women with PUL were classified as high risk, of whom 60 (38.7%), 66 (42.8%) and 29 (18.7%) had a final outcome of FPUL, IUP and EP, respectively. Of the 32 women with PUL with a final outcome of EP, 29 (90.6%) were classified as high risk and three (9.4%) were classified as low risk. Therefore, the performance of the M6NP model to predict EP had a negative predictive value of 98.4%, a positive predictive value of 18.7%, sensitivity of 90.6% and specificity of 59.2%. If the prediction model had been used, it is estimated that 4.5 visits per patient could have been prevented. The M6NP model could be used safely in the French population for risk stratification of PUL. Its use in clinical practice should result in a substantial reduction in the number of visits to a gynaecological emergency room."

    "abstract": "This study investigated the clinicopathological features and surgical procedures of adnexal masses with abdominal pain in pediatric and adolescent patients. Our objective was to better define the clinical presentation of adnexal torsion and to distinguish characteristics of those with torsion and those with an alternate diagnosis. Retrospective cohort study of 212 pediatric and adolescent patients was performed who admitted for abdominal pain and presenting with an adnexal mass between March 2012 to December 2019.Medical records were reviewed for age at operation, including presentation of symptoms and signs; the levels of tumor markers; imaging examinations; pathologic findings; the size of masses; treatment; and outcome. Data management and descriptive analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0. The median age of the patients was 14.5 ± 3.6 years at the operation. 126 (59.4%, 126/212) patients presented with an abrupt onset of abdominal pain. A total of 82.1% (174/212) of the participants underwent adnexal conservative surgery. 179 (84.5%, 179/212) patients underwent laparoscopic surgery with an average tumor size of 7.7 ± 3.4 cm, while 33 patients ( 15.6%, 33/212) underwent laparotomy. Rupture of mass and ectopic pregnancy accounted for 7.5% (16/212) and 0.9%(2/212), respectively. Torsion was responsible for 36.8% (78/212) of all patients. Among the patients with torsion, the symptom of nausea and vomiting was more common among girls without torsion (P < 0.0001). 88.5% of the girls with torsion had acute onset of abdominal pain, while 92.3% had persistent pain that could not be relieved or occurred repeatedly, which significantly higher than that in the patients without torsion (P < 0.001). 69.2% of patients with torsion had fixed pain sites, compared with 42.2% in patients without torsion (P < 0.001). 88.5% of girls with torsion had an ovarian cyst/mass ≥ 5 cm, compared with 75.0% in girls without torsion (P = 0.038). 66.7% of girls underwent ovary-preserving surgery, compared with 92.2% in patients without torsion. The most common pathologic types were mature teratoma and simple cyst, accounting for 29.4% and 25.6%, respectively. The multivariate analyses confirmed that mass size greater than 5 cm (OR 4.134, 95% CI: 1.349-12.669,P = 0.013), acute onset pain (OR 24.150,95%CI: 8.398-69.444,P = 0.000), persistent or recurrent pain (OR 15.911,95%CI: 6.164-41.075,P = 0.000) were significantly associated with increased risk of torsion. Torsion which is a relatively rare event in the pediatric population was not an uncommon condition and responsible for more than one third of all pediatric and adolescent patients presented with adnexal masses and abdominal pain. Pain assessment in children and adolescents is important to distinguish characteristics of those with torsion and those with an alternate diagnosis.Thus, pediatric and adolescent patients particularly with a pelvic mass size greater than 5 cm, acute onset pain, persistent or recurrent pain have a benign cause and not missing the devastating condition that needs emergent attention. Thus, a strategy of earlier and liberal use of Diagnostic Laparoscopy (DL) may improve ovarian salvage."

    "abstract": "Interstitial ectopic pregnancy is an ectopic gestation developing in the uterine part of the fallopian tube. The condition is rare and presents challenges for clinical as well as radiological diagnosis. This case report presents a rare case of interstitial ectopic pregnancy diagnosed intraoperatively. A 36-year-old Black woman, referred from a peripheral health facility, presented at the emergency department with severe abdominal pains, vaginal spotting, nausea, and vomiting, with a 2-month history of irregular menstrual flow. Clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive of an acute abdomen likely due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy (ultrasound was not available). An emergency exploratory laparotomy was done, which revealed a right adnexal ruptured interstitial pregnancy of a lifeless female fetus weighing 500 g (estimated mean gestational age of 22-23 weeks). The left fallopian tube looked normal. The site of rupture was repaired, followed by cleaning and closure of the abdomen. The post-operative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Interstitial pregnancies are uncommon and rarely attain advanced gestational ages, as in this case, compared with other tubal ectopic pregnancies. However, women presenting with signs of hypovolemic shock and acute abdomen, with a positive pregnancy test, warrant a high index of suspicion."

The primary research question centered on the reliability and predictive accuracy of objective parameters in determining methotrexate therapy success. Conducted as a retrospective single-center cohort study, data from 172 ectopic pregnancy patients treated with methotrexate between January 2021 and January 2023 were analyzed. Parameters including adnexal mass size, peritoneal fluid presence, yolk sac identification, endometrial thickness, ectopic pregnancy location, and initial B-hCG levels were meticulously evaluated for their association with treatment outcomes. Following the exclusion of 21 emergency surgery cases, the final analysis comprised 151 patients. Notable associations were observed between specific parameters (fetal cardiac activity, adnexal mass size  > 3.5 cm, peritoneal fluid presence, yolk sac identification, endometrial thickness  > 10 mm, and initial B-hCG levels) and treatment outcomes (p < 0.001). Additionally, the novel scoring system demonstrated promising predictive performance. At a cutoff of 2.50, it achieved a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 59.7%. Increasing the cutoff to 3.50 resulted in a sensitivity of 94.0%, with a specificity of 46.3%. Objective parameters, particularly those integrated into the developed scoring system, exhibited substantial associations with methotrexate therapy outcomes in ectopic pregnancy. These findings underscore the potential of an objective scoring model to significantly influence clinical decision-making in therapy, offering avenues for enhanced prognostication and patient care in treatment outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies are a frequently encountered cause of first-trimester metrorrhagia. They occur when an embryo is implanted and grows outside the normal uterine space. Uncommonly, the embryo can be implanted in the intramural portion of the uterine tube, a condition referred to as interstitial localization. This specific type of ectopic pregnancy may have an unpredictable course, potentially leading to severe uterine rupture and catastrophic bleeding if not promptly diagnosed and managed. We present a rare case of a multiparous 36-year-old female patient who underwent pelvic ultrasonography in the emergency department for intense pelvic pain associated with hypotension and moderate anemia. A history of right salpingectomy for a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy 10 years previously was noted. High beta-HCG levels were also detected. A pelvic ultrasound allowed us to suspect a ruptured ectopic interstitial pregnancy at 8 weeks of amenorrhea. An association with hemoperitoneum was suspected, and an emergency laparoscopy was performed. The condition was confirmed intraoperatively, and the patient underwent a right corneal wedge resection with suture of the uterine myometrium. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fourth day postoperatively. Interstitial ectopic pregnancy is a rare yet extremely perilous situation. Timely ultrasound-based diagnosis is crucial as it can enable conservative management with Methotrexate. Delayed diagnosis can lead to uterine rupture with consecutive surgery based on a transection of the pregnancy and cornual uterine resection."

This study aims to describe the clinical presentation, physical examination, emergency management, radiographic and intraoperative findings, histopathology reports and the time-to-intervention metrics of OT cases presenting to the emergency room of our tertiary care center. Data was collected by a retrospective chart review of all OT cases that presented to our ED over a period of 1 year. A total of 20 cases were included in the final analysis. The incidence of OT in the ED was 157.4 per 100 000 visits of women in the reproductive age group. All patients were women of reproductive age, with a mean age of 27.3 years. A total of 15 patients (78.9%) presented within 24 hours of symptom onset. The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (95%, 19/20) with most localizing to the right lower quadrant (60%, 12/20), followed by nausea and vomiting (90%, 18/20). Almost all patients (95%, 19/20) required opioids for pain management. The majority (80%, 16/20) were diagnosed by ultrasound prior to surgery, whereas (20%, 4/20) went straight to surgery based on a high index of clinical suspicion. Among those who underwent ultrasound, ovarian cyst was present in (75%, 12/16) while (68.9%, 11/16) showed ovarian enlargement and (50%, 8/16) showed abnormal ovarian blood flow. All patients except one patient underwent operative management. Out of the 19 patients who underwent surgery, the majority of patients (94.7%, 18/19) had viable ovaries with the exception of 1 patient (5.3%) who required a salpingo-oophorectomy post ovarian detorsion. A total of 13 cases included histopathologic review of specimens out of which 6 (46.2%) had a mature cystic teratoma. The mean time from door to ultrasonography was 1.4 hours and from door to surgery was 11.4 hours.

    "abstract": "To combine all literature describing cases of isolated fallopian tube torsion in adult non pregnant patients in a systematic manner, to optimize knowledge and practice both for diagnosis and management. EMBASE and PubMed databases were searched for the terms 'tubal' OR 'fallopian tube' AND 'isolated' AND 'torsion' from the inception of these databases to July 5, 2023. All case reports or case series of adult patients (18 years or older) with isolated fallopian tube torsion were included. Exclusion criteria included: all other study types; cases involving children and adolescents (less than 18 years old); pregnant patients of all trimesters; tubo-ovarian torsion; studies not published in English; duplicates and those not available in text. Following the database search, two authors independently screened the studies and search results were subsequently reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Data was extracted independently by two authors and analysed using Excel. All cases were assessed for bias using a modified version of the tool proposed by Murad et al. RESULTS: 92 unique articles enrolling 131 individual cases were included in this systematic review. Isolated fallopian tube torsion most commonly occurs during reproductive ages between 18 and 45 years. It is uncommon in postmenopausal women. The most common presenting symptoms include unilateral lower abdominal or pelvic pain along the affected side with nausea and vomiting. Risk factors can be intrinsic or extrinsic and can include conditions such as hydrosalpinx, sterilization, pelvic inflammatory disease or cysts. Ultrasound is the optimal imaging modality however Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging can also be used. Imaging in general has low sensitivity, however isolated fallopian tube torsion can be identified with appropriate expertise. The gold standard for isolated fallopian tube torsion management is laparoscopy and detorsion however currently, the most common intervention performed is salpingectomy. Isolated fallopian tube torsion is a rare but important gynaecological emergency with significant fertility implications. This study summarizes the most common presentations, investigation findings and surgical interventions in patients with isolated fallopian tube torsion. This study also emphasizes the importance of clinicians maintaining a high degree of suspicion and low threshold for early laparoscopic intervention to retain fertility."

Very few cases of stromal carcinoid have been reported in the literature in women of childbearing age, particularly during pregnancy. The clinical presentation of the tumor, and in particular its non-specific clinical and radiological appearance and rarity, explain the difficulties in diagnosis and management. Herein, we describe a rare case of a 36-year-old patient who was followed-up in our outpatient clinic for organic cyst of the ovary. The ultrasound revealed a multilocular regular cystic mass with a modestly thickened wall and fine septations. The MRI indicated a right ovarian cyst with solid tissue. The levels of tumor markers were normal. The patient was lost to follow-up and did not return until six months later. She was admitted in our Department with acute ovarian torsion and underwent emergency surgery at 17 weeks' gestation. A laparoscopic cystectomy of the right ovary was provisionally performed. Pathology revealed an ovarian strumal carcinoid tumor. Patients with ovarian stromal carcinoid have an excellent prognosis. Ovarian strumal carcinoid 's primary therapy method is operation. The majority of original ovarian carcinoid tumors progress slowly, and practically all thyroid carcinoid tumors are clinical stage I with a positive prognosis. In the absence of standardized treatment, the association of carcinoid strumal tumor with pregnancy, underlines the need for early diagnosis and appropriate multidisciplinary management, taking into account both the maternal and fetal prognosis."

It commonly presents with a history of amenorrhoea, lower abdominal pain, and slight vaginal bleeding. The fallopian tube is the most typical location for ectopic pregnancy. Two percent of reported pregnancies are ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy remains a public health threat for women in reproductive age, and a major cause of maternal mortalities in the first trimester. In East Africa, these reports are limited, despite a great need for documentation addressing key considerations for diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy in these resource limited settings. In this case study, we report on 26-years-old female Gravida 5 Para 4 Living 4, who reported history of amenorrhoea for 3 months complaining of slight per vagina bleeding and lower abdominal pain for 5 days more marked at left iliac region along with generalized weakness for 2 weeks. Her vitals were stable. Pelvic ultrasound revealed empty uterus and live fetus at the left adnexa corresponding to 14 weeks 6 days with minimal free fluid in the Douglas Cul-de-sac. The patient's final diagnosis was live extra-uterine pregnancy at 14 weeks 6 days that was managed by emergency laparotomy with salpingectomy. The patient recovered completely after surgery and was discharged in a stable condition. Ectopic pregnancy still remains one of the major causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and referral in hemodynamically state along with use of minimal access surgery or management can change the scenario of ectopic pregnancy in the developing world. Late attendance to first visit clinics is still a major concern in low resource limited settings as this could have been picked early and intervened. Key message: Management of broad ligament ectopic pregnancy in the second trimester is still challenging especially in low resource settings where the clients do not attend clinics and because of unavailability of ultrasound machines to diagnose it."

Individuals were screened using a standardized no-test protocol, primarily relying on their medical history to assess medical eligibility. We assessed effectiveness, defined as complete abortion after 200 mg mifepristone and 1,600 μg misoprostol (or lower) without additional intervention; safety was measured by the absence of serious adverse events. We estimated rates using multivariable logistic regression and multiple imputation to account for missing data. Among 6,034 abortions, 97.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 97.2-98.1%) were complete without subsequent known intervention or ongoing pregnancy after the initial treatment. Overall, 99.8% (99.6-99.9%) of abortions were not followed by serious adverse events. In total, 0.25% of patients experienced a serious abortion-related adverse event, 0.16% were treated for an ectopic pregnancy and 1.3% abortions were followed by emergency department visits. There were no differences in effectiveness or safety between synchronous and asynchronous models of care.

The patient did not have a gynecological examination for this reason. During the examination, taking into account the clinical and ultrasound findings, a suspicion of pregnancy in a bicornuate uterus was raised, and an MRI of the pelvis was performed. MRI showed ectopic pregnancy in the left fallopian tube with a properly developed fetus that corresponded to a gestation of 19 weeks. An emergency laparotomy was performed and the left fallopian tube with the fetus was removed. The early and late course of recovery went smoothly.

Possible delayed diagnosis, defined as a patient with an ED discharge within 7 days prior to diagnosis. A secondary outcome was condition-specific complications. Rates of possible delayed diagnosis and complications were determined. The association of volume with delayed diagnosis across conditions was evaluated using conditional logistic regression matching on condition, age, and medical complexity. Condition-specific volume-delay associations were tested using hierarchical logistic models with log volume as the exposure, adjusting for age, sex, payer, medical complexity, and hospital urbanicity. The association of delayed diagnosis with complications by condition was then examined using logistic regressions. Of 58 998 included children, 37 211 (63.1%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 7.1 (5.8) years. A total of 6709 (11.4%) had a complex chronic condition. Delayed diagnosis occurred in 9296 (15.8%; 95% CI, 15.5-16.1). Each 2-fold increase in annual pediatric volume was associated with a 26.7% (95% CI, 22.5-30.7) decrease in possible delayed diagnosis. For 21 of 23 conditions (all except ectopic pregnancy and sinus venous thrombosis), there were decreased rates of possible delayed diagnosis with increasing ED volume. Condition-specific complications were 11.2% (95% CI, 3.1-20.0) more likely among patients with a possible delayed diagnosis compared with those without. EDs with fewer pediatric encounters had more possible delayed diagnoses across 23 serious conditions. Tools to support timely diagnosis in low-volume EDs are needed."

Thirty patients (18%) were diagnosed with an alternative diagnosis on MRI: 17/30 (56.7%) patients had a gynecological source of abdominal pain (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, red degeneration of a leiomyoma); 8 patients (26.7%) had urological findings such as pyelonephritis; and 6 patients (20%) had gastrointestinal diagnoses (e.g. abdominal wall hernia or inflammatory bowel disease). Our conclusions are that MRI is a good diagnostic tool in the pregnant patient, not only in diagnosing acute appendicitis, but also in providing information on alternative diagnoses to acute abdominal pain. Our findings show the various differential diagnoses on emergent MRI in pregnant patients with suspected acute appendicitis, which may assist clinicians and radiologists is patient assessment and imaging utilization."

    "abstract": "Cystic lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor that affects the lymphatic system. Mesenteric lymphangiomas in the small bowel are extremely uncommon. We present a 21-year-old female patient who complained of abdominal pain. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was suspected after abdominopelvic unenhanced computed tomography and ultrasound revealed a large cyst in contact with the bladder, ovary, and uterus. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy performed by gynecologists, but it was discovered that the cystic tumor originated from the jejunum. Gastrointestinal surgeons were then called in to perform a cystectomy. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma of the mesentery. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery. Mesenteric lymphangiomas can cause abdominal pain, and imaging techniques can help determine their characteristics, location, and size. Complete surgical excision and pathological examination are considered the standard treatment and diagnostic method."

    "abstract": "Abdominal ectopic pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. This study reports a case of advanced abdominal ectopic pregnancy at 26-weeks' gestation in a 31-year-old primigravida whose conception was a result of in vitro fertilization because of infertility due to male factors. Her past history is significant for a congenital Horseshoe kidney. Initially, she presented at the 8th week of gestation with a clinical picture that is consistent with ectopic abdominal pregnancy; however, she refused to terminate her pregnancy despite medical advice. At 26 weeks gestation, she presented to the emergency department again complaining of lower abdominal pain and vaginal spotting, and underwent an abdominal laparotomy without any complications. The postoperative period was unremarkable, and she was discharged after 7 days. In conclusion, early diagnosis and management of such cases are of paramount importance and lead to favorable outcomes. Nevertheless, we stress the importance of providing effective counseling to patients presenting with serious conditions through clear information along with proper psychological support for couples."

Although the frequency of ectopic bilateral pregnancy has increased with the advent of medically assisted procreation, spontaneous bilateral tubal pregnancies remain rare. Early detection of this type of ectopic pregnancy is important to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity. Conservative surgery must also be considered, as preservation of both tubes is presumed to offer better fertility prospects. We report the case of a 35-year-old patient at five weeks of amenorrhea with bilateral ectopic pregnancy diagnosed based on ultrasound scans and confirmed during laparotomy. A 35-year-old woman with a history of three vaginal deliveries, non-smoker, on contraceptives (microprogestins), presented with pelvic pain and amenorrhea of five weeks. A beta HCG test came back positive. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a moderate hemoperitoneum and an empty uterus with hematometra. It also showed heterogeneous left and right adnexal masses measuring 3 cm and 4 cm, respectively. An emergency laparotomy was performed. Per-operatively, two bilateral tubal pregnancies of 3 cm and 4 cm were founded. The patient received conservative treatment with bilateral salpingotomy. Postoperative management was uneventful. The diagnosis of spontaneous bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancy is rare and often established at the time of surgery, hence the importance of a rigorous and vigilant examination of the two tubes during ultrasound examination and surgery, so as not to miss it and to better prevent maternal mortality. Conservative surgery must be carefully chosen."

    "abstract": "Pelvic masses occur in up to 20% of women throughout their lifetime. These masses represent a spectrum of gynecologic and nongynecologic conditions. Adnexal masses-found in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and surrounding areas-are mostly benign. Evaluation includes assessment for symptoms that may suggest malignancy, such as abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and early satiety. A family history of ovarian, breast, or certain heritable syndromes increases the risk of malignancy. For women of reproductive age, ectopic pregnancies must be considered; a beta human chorionic gonadotropin level should be obtained. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the imaging test of choice for evaluating adnexal masses for size and complexity. Adnexal cysts that are greater than 10 cm, contain solid components, or have high color flow on Doppler ultrasonography are high risk for malignancy. Further imaging, if warranted, should be completed with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, particularly if there is concern for disease outside the ovary. Multimodal assessment tools that use ultrasonography and biomarkers, such as the risk of malignancy index, are useful in the diagnosis and exclusion of malignant causes. Asymptomatic masses that are determined to be benign may be observed and managed expectantly. In symptomatic or emergent cases, such as ectopic pregnancy or ovarian torsion, a gynecologist should be consulted. In any adnexal mass with high risk for malignancy, a consultation with gynecologic oncology is indicated."

This decision has allowed states to promulgate different restrictions on abortion, many of which implicate the practice of emergency medicine. An abortion is defined as a \"medical intervention provided to individuals who need to end the medical condition of pregnancy\" and includes care such as termination of an ectopic pregnancy and induction of labor for previable preterm premature rupture of membranes-interventions that emergency physicians either perform or rely on the assistance of consultants to perform. State bans on abortion must be evaluated against duties under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law that preempts state law.

This article presents a case of recurrent torsion, and reviews the literature to highlight the significance of early diagnosis and management. The case is presented of a nulliparous 31-year-old woman who presented on five occasions with symptoms of acute pain and vomiting. Adnexal torsion was suspected on clinical assessment and ultrasound scan. She was found to have left-sided isolated fallopian tube torsion twice, and tubo-ovarian torsion on two occasions. Detorsion was performed four times. Bilateral oophoropexy was performed during an emergency laparoscopy on the fourth presentation. The left ovary was conserved, but viability was doubted. She presented four weeks later with similar symptoms. An intraoperative finding was of an auto-amputated left ovary with no attachment to infudibulopelvic ligament. This ovary was removed. Operative management was performed promptly, but planned oophoropexy was delayed, and an earlier procedure may have resulted in conservation of the ovary. There is no standardised management for prevention of recurrent ovarian torsion. The benefits of oophoropexy to prevent further torsion versus risks lack evidence. There is also debate as to the method by which oophoropexy is done. There is no consensus or guideline regarding the best management approach for recurrent adnexal torsion. Further research is needed to obtain evidence to support clinicians in discussing management options with their patients."

Case 2: A woman was diagnosed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy with right pleural fluid and ascites without respiratory failure. A diagnosis of clinical pleuroperitoneal communication was considered based on computed tomography findings. During laparoscopic salpingectomy, high-pressure ventilation was performed to push the pleural fluid back into the abdominal cavity; a negative-pressure drain was inserted, and the ascites was completely removed. Postoperative radiography revealed the absence of pleural fluid. Therefore, a preoperative diagnosis of clinical pleuroperitoneal communication and appropriate intraoperative techniques can prevent postoperative respiratory failure."

It is therefore important to know about its existence because late management can lead to increased maternal mortality. This paper reports the case of a 22-year-old lady at 18 weeks gestation who had generalized abdominal pain for two months. Prior to her arrival at our service, an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound done revealed a viable singleton 18-weeks intra-abdominal pregnancy with a moderate amount of abdominal fluid collection. The diagnosis of haemorrhagic shock complicating an abdominal pregnancy at 18 weeks of gestation was retained. An emergency laparotomy was done, and a right total salpingectomy and oophorectomy with resection of the right broad ligament were carried out. After surgery, dissection of the mass revealed a non-viable male foetus weighing 218 grams. In conclusion, there´s a very high morbidity and mortality rate associated with broad ligament pregnancies. Due to the fact that there is late access to antenatal care, the prognosis of pathologic pregnancies is endangered."

Ovaries may be difficult to visualize sonographically; therefore, prompt diagnosis using US alone can be challenging. Rapid MRI as first-line imaging may help streamline patient throughput, especially with increasing MRI availability in the ED. To assess feasibility of rapid MRI for diagnosis of ovarian torsion. A retrospective, single-center IRB approved study of MRI performed in female pediatric patients presenting with abdominopelvic pain from August 2022 to January 2023. Imaging occurred according to one of three clinical pathways (US-first approach vs MRI-first approach vs US + MRI-second-line approach). A rapid three-sequence free-breathing MRI protocol was utilized. Frequency of ovarian torsion and secondary diagnoses was recorded. Length of MR scan time, time from ED arrival to time of diagnosis, and whether patient had US prior to MR exam were obtained. A historical cohort of patients with US only performed for assessment of ovarian torsion were evaluated for length of the US examination and time from ED arrival to time of diagnosis. Intervals were compared using the uncorrected Fisher's least significant difference and Turkey's multiple comparison tests. A total of 140 MRI exams (mean age 14.6 years) and 248 historical US exams (mean age 13.5 years) were included. Of the patients with MRI, 41 (29%) patients were imaged with US + MRI and 99 (71%) imaged with MRI only; 4% (6/140) MR exams were suspicious for ovarian torsion, with one true positive case (1/6 TP) and 5 false positive cases (5/6 FP); 26.4% (37/140) of exams had secondary diagnoses. Median MRI scan time was 11.4 min (4.4) vs median historical US scan time was 24.1 min (19.7) (P<0.001). Median time from arrival in ED to MRI read was 242 (140). Median time from arrival in ED to US only read was 268 min (148). This was not a statistically significant difference when compared to the MRI only cohort. First-line MRI imaging for evaluation of ovarian torsion is a rapid and feasible imaging modality for female patients in the emergent setting."

    "abstract": "Clinical management of emergency pregnancy care, such as ectopic pregnancy or heavy bleeding with pregnancy of unknown location, includes upholding legal and ethical standards. For health care providers unwilling to provide evidence-based life-saving abortion care due to personal beliefs, clear guidance dictates disclosure of these limitations to the patient and colleagues, followed by immediate referral for appropriate care. However, this decision-making pathway may not be engaged due to a variety of factors: providers' beliefs preclude adherence to referral responsibilities, political discourse confuses patients as to their options and rights, and a constantly changing state and national legal landscape leads providers to question their ability to practice to their full scope of clinical care. Although this disruption of evidence-based standard of care existed pre-Dobbs, the moral disorder is now heightened. This Clinical Rounds highlights a patient vignette describing the risks of abortion restrictions for patients and providers alike, particularly when an individual provider's concerns for violating institutional guidelines sets a precedent for nursing response and forecloses on collaborative input or ethics consultation. The history of physician-only abortion exceptionalism and exclusion of nurses and midwives despite a significant history of nurses and midwives in abortion care grounds an argument for focusing on the impact of unethical and substandard care on the interprofessional care team leading to moral distress and negative patient outcomes. Patient-centered models of care, such as frameworks common in nursing and midwifery, offer opportunities to consider how all providers practicing to their full scope in interprofessional and collaborative ways, such as in emergency rooms and labor departments, might mitigate obstructions to abortion care that risk pregnant people's lives."

A retrospective cohort study was performed at DAI Materno Infantile of AOU Federico II of Naples, analyzing all medical records of women who met the inclusion criteria between April 2020 and April 2023. Eighty-two women (35 under SA in group A and 47 under GA in group B) undergone elective or emergency laparoscopic salpingectomy for ectopic tubal or ovarian pregnancy were included. Patients in group A reported less pain at 0 h (adjusted mean difference: -1.5; 95% CI: -2.3 to -0.7; p &lt; 0.001) and after 6 h (adjusted mean difference: -1.1; 95% CI: -2.0 to -0.3; p = 0.01) while no statistically significant differences between the two groups at 12 and 24 h after surgery. No differences were observed among the type of analgesic and during the postoperative observation time, except for paracetamol at 0 h in group B. A faster resumption of bowel motility, patient's mobilization, and a shorter hospital stay were observed in group A compared to group B. Also greater odds of returning faster to daily activities emerged in group A (adjusted OR: 5.39; 95% CI: 1.77-16.37). A greater number of patients in group A were satisfied with the entire procedure compared to those of group B (33 [94.3%] vs. 37 [78.7%]). The general surgeon satisfaction was always very good or excellent in group A. Finally, all surgical steps were well tolerated in group A.

A full bladder is required to visualize the ovaries. Bladder filling is a time-consuming process leading to delays to TPUS, poor visualization of ovaries requiring repeat studies, and prolonged emergency department length of stay (ED LOS). The primary objective was to decrease the time to TPUS by standardizing the bladder filling process. This quality improvement initiative occurred at a single, academic, quaternary-care children's hospital ED and utilized the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for Improvement with sequential plan-do-study-act cycles. The first set of interventions implemented in August 2021 included a new electronic order set and bladder scan by ED nurses. Subsequent plan-do-study-act cycles aimed to decrease the time to intravenous fluid, decrease fluid requirement, and decrease the need for intravenous fluid. The primary outcome measure was the monthly mean time to TPUS. Secondary outcome measures included monthly mean ED LOS and percentage of repeat TPUS. We performed data analysis with statistical process control charts to assess for system change over time. The preintervention baseline included 292 ED encounters more than 10 months, and postintervention analysis included 526 ED encounters more than 16 months. Time to TPUS decreased (138-120 min), ED LOS decreased (372-335 min), and repeat TPUS decreased (18% to 4%). All changes met the rules for special cause variation. Standardizing the bladder filling process was associated with decreased time to TPUS, ED LOS, and repeat TPUS."

In this cross-sectional analysis, we analyzed patients who presented for emergency care for tubal ectopic pregnancies, ovarian torsion, and PID using the Premier Healthcare Database from 2006 to 2020. We measured the following outcomes: methotrexate use for ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cystectomy for torsion, and guideline-based antibiotic use for PID. For each condition, we measured outlier hospitals that performed the above interventions at below the 10th percentile. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between outlier care and hospital factors such as annualized mean case volume, urban or rural location, teaching status, bed capacity, and geographic region, as well as hospital-level patient population factors, including age, insurance status, and race. A total of 602 hospitals treated patients with tubal ectopic pregnancies, of which 21.9% were outliers, with no cases managed with methotrexate. Of 512 hospitals treating patients with ovarian torsion, 17.4% were outliers, with no cases managed with cystectomy. Of 929 hospitals that treated patients with PID, 9.9% were deemed outliers with low rates of guideline-adherent antibiotic administration. Low-volume hospitals were more likely to be outliers with low rates of use of methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy (6.7% of high-volume hospitals vs 49.7% of low-volume hospitals were outliers; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.13, 95% CI, 0.05-0.31 for high-volume hospitals) and cystectomy for torsion (34.9% of low-volume vs 2.4% of high-volume hospitals were outliers; aOR 0.05, 95% CI, 0.01-0.18 for high-volume hospitals). There was no association between hospital volume and lower rates of guideline-based antibiotic use for PID.

A 38-year-old G5P5 female with a past medical history significant for ureterolithiasis presented to a freestanding ED with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She developed sudden onset of right sided abdominal pain radiating to her right flank upon awakening. The initial differential diagnosis was for ureterolithiasis or appendicitis. Her complete blood count (CBC) was normal, and testing for pregnancy, infection, and hematuria was negative. Computed topography (CT) imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 9 cm adnexal mass, consistent with a possible dermoid cyst. A pelvic ultrasound was ordered which showed a possible ovarian torsion. She was transferred to a tertiary care hospital where she had a laparoscopy with right-sided oophorectomy and salpingectomy performed. This patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and was first suspected to have ureterolithiasis or appendicitis. She was found to have an ovarian torsion with a dermoid cyst, which resulted in the loss of her ovary and fallopian tube.

Little is known about women's views for treatment of less active ectopic pregnancy. What are the preferences of women for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes? A discrete choice model with 8 attributes depicting ectopic pregnancy treatment including varying levels of first-line treatment effectiveness, length of hospitalization, cost, length of sick leave, of convalescence, need for surgical management, for emergency care during convalescence and for tube removal was used. Childbearing aged women, i.e. those who might experience an ectopic pregnancy in the future, were recruited. They were asked to choose between hypothetical treatments in 18 choice tasks with different levels of all treatment attributes. A conditional logit McFadden's choice model was performed. The main outcome measure was preference weights for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes. A total of 5770 observations from 178 women were analysed. The attributes displaying the highest marginal impacts on women's decisions included: higher rate of first-line treatment effectiveness, lower rate of tube removal, lower rate of surgical management, shorter length of hospitalization and, to a lesser extent, but still significant, shorter length of convalescence, absence of risk of emergency care during convalescence and lower cost. Trade-offs made by women between the attributes of less active ectopic pregnancy treatment suggest that no treatment option, either medical or surgical, is an obvious preferred option. These results encourage the promotion of shared decision-making."

Despite a still limited level of evidence, compared to conventional laparoscopy, vNOTES seems to be associated with reduced blood loss, shorter operative time, less postoperative pain, shorter hospitalization time, better cosmetic results and decreased postoperative morbidity. Although growing evidence supports the effectiveness of vNOTES for elective adnexal surgeries, there is still limited knowledge regarding its feasibility and safety in emergency settings. In the present study, we report our experience performing vNOTES in gynecological emergency cases. We prospectively collected and analyzed data from patients who underwent vNOTES for gynecological emergencies between November 2021 and June 2023. Demographic and perioperative characteristics were collected and analyzed. Seventeen patients were included. Interventions were realized for suspicion of ectopic pregnancy in 7 cases (41.2%), for suspicion of adnexal torsion in 7 cases (41.2%), for post-hysterectomy hemoperitoneum in 2 cases (11.8%), and for uncontrollable uterine bleeding in 1 case (5.9%). Emergency procedures included unilateral salpingectomy (35.3%), ovarian cystectomy (23.5%), ovarian cystotomy (17.6%), adnexal detorsion (11.8%), hemoperitoneum drainage (11.8%), hysterectomy (5.9%), and appendectomy (5.9%). The overall median operative time was 38 [18-72] minutes. The median estimated intraoperative blood loss was 30 [5-150] mL, and no intraoperative complications occurred. Conversion to conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy was never needed. Patients stayed hospitalized for a median time of 30 [4-144] hours after the intervention. The median visual analog scale value for postoperative pain evaluation was 2 [0-5] at 12, 24, and 48 postoperative hours. No complications associated with the procedure occurred. This study demonstrated the feasibility of performing vNOTES procedures for managing gynecological emergencies such as tubal ectopic pregnancy, adnexal torsion, painful ovarian lesions, post-hysterectomy hemoperitoneum, and uncontrollable uterine bleeding. Associated with data reported in the available literature, our results suggest potential benefits in treating gynecological emergencies by vNOTES over conventional laparoscopy. However, stronger evidence from larger studies is needed to confirm it."

A positive urine pregnancy test and elevated serum quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin level of 1,735 mIU/mL (normal range: <5 mIU/mL) confirmed pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an empty intrauterine cavity with no gestational sac or fetal pole. A 2 cm cystic structure was identified attached to the left ovary. Ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed, methotrexate was administered, and the patient was discharged with a scheduled outpatient follow-up. However, she returned to the emergency room within 48 hours reporting persistent pelvic pain. At this moment, it was decided that emergent surgical intervention was required. The surgical exploration confirmed the presence of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the round ligament, requiring excision and hemostasis. This case report highlights the importance of considering abnormal localization of ectopic pregnancy as a differential diagnosis in women presenting with pelvic pain, even after bilateral salpingectomies. It emphasizes the challenges in diagnosis and management when ectopic pregnancy occurs in atypical sites and highlights the necessity for vigilant follow-up and prompt surgical intervention when medical management fails."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy in rudimentary horn is an uncommon presentation of an ectopic pregnancy. It needs a very high degree of suspicion for diagnosis and the diagnosis becomes difficult in cases with previous vaginal deliveries. A 25-year-old female patient with two spontaneous vaginal deliveries and a history of spontaneous abortion at five months visited the obstetric emergency department with a history of five months of amenorrhea with pain abdomen and breathlessness for one day. On abdominal examination abdomen was distended, and rigid, and tenderness was present. Paracentesis was done where blood was present. On bimanual examination, cervical motion tenderness was present, and left-sided fornices fullness was present. The patient was admitted, and her sonography was done for suspicion of a ruptured uterus or ectopic pregnancy. The sonography report showed a bulky uterus with decidual reactions and a well-defined pregnancy of 21 weeks and 6 days in the right adnexal region with hemoperitoneum suggesting suspicion of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. After initial treatment and arrangement of two units of packed red blood cells after proper grouping and cross-matching for the patient, laparotomy was done. At the time of surgery, there was a right-sided rupture of non-communicating rudimentary horn pregnancy with a unicornuate uterus. A dead fetus of 600 grams lies in the peritoneal cavity with two liters of hemoperitoneum. Timely diagnosis and laparotomy saved the life of the patient."

    "abstract": "Synchronous bilateral ovarian torsion is rare that too in nonpathological ovaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of synchronous bilateral ovarian torsion of nonpathological ovaries in adolescents. A 14-year-old girl presented with pain lower abdomen, vomiting, and constipation for the last 10 days. Ultrasonography (USG) suggested bilateral ovarian torsion without any ovarian pathology. Emergency laparoscopy confirmed bilateral ovarian torsion with necrosed-looking ovaries, and detorsion was done. During follow-up period, she had intermittent mild pain abdomen, and on USG, her left ovary returned to normal size, but her right ovary had been bulky throughout without any cyst. At around 10 months, the patient presented with severe abdomen pain. This time only right ovarian torsion was there. Laparoscopic bilateral ovarian detorsion with bilateral ovarian ligament plication was done. Ovarian torsion can be bilateral, even in nonpathological ovaries. Ovarian fixation should be done in these cases to prevent recurrent torsion."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is a rare phenomenon. Despite its rarity, there has been a notable increase in its incidence in recent decades due to the greater use of in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, information about the relation between ovarian stimulation and HP is scarce. We report a case of HP after ovarian stimulation using clomiphene citrate. A 26-year-old pregnant woman presented to the emergency department with mild vaginal bleeding, and abdominal pain. She had a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and left salpingectomy due to a previous ectopic pregnancy. She had undergone ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate three months earlier. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an eight-week-old ruptured tubal pregnancy with an intrauterine ten-week-old gestational sac confirming superfetation HP. An urgent laparoscopic right salpingectomy was performed and the extrauterine pregnancy was successfully removed with the preservation of the intrauterine embryo. The course of the intrauterine pregnancy was uneventful and the patient gave birth to a healthy boy via cesarean section. Women receiving ovarian stimulation are at an increased risk of developing HP especially when they also have other predisposing factors for HP. Thus, close monitoring using transvaginal ultrasound with extra attention to the adnexa is required for a timely diagnosis and management of HP."

    "abstract": "To demonstrate and discuss a case of primary hepatic ectopic pregnancy and laparoscopic management. Case presentation with demonstration of surgical hepatic wedge resection. Tertiary referral center in Manchester, United Kingdom. A 33-year-old women gravida 13 para 2 with a body mass index of 55 kg/m2 and previous 2 cesarean sections and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy presented to the emergency services after a private ultrasound scan showing a pregnancy of unknown location and a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) of 18 336 IU/mL. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed but fallopian tubes were normal with no signs of ectopic pregnancy seen. An abdominal ultrasound scan was performed but did not identify the ectopic pregnancy. Owing to worsening symptoms of pain and rising hCG levels, she underwent a further laparoscopy converted to laparotomy and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for suspected left ovarian pregnancy. However, serum hCG levels continued to rise after the surgery, reaching 36 960 IU/mL. An magnetic resonance imaging scan of her abdomen and pelvis was arranged that showed a 4 cm cystic lesion in the segment V of the liver. Further ultrasound correlation showed a hyperechoic lesion with echogenic components suspicious of an ectopic pregnancy with a fetal pole. Fetal heart action was not visualized. A multidisciplinary team approach was adopted with involvement of the hepatobiliary surgical team, and the option of medical management with methotrexate and surgical excision was considered. A decision was made for surgical excision based on the accessible location of the ectopic pregnancy on segment V and the more controlled and predictable outcome with surgical excision. A preoperative computed tomography scan confirmed the lesion in segment V of liver in keeping with liver capsular implantation of ectopic pregnancy (Video still 1). At laparoscopy the ectopic pregnancy was visualized on the inferior surface of liver close to the inferior margin with a band of overlying omental adhesion (Video still 2). The overlying omental adhesions were sealed and cut with advanced bipolar diathermy, keeping a safe margin from the ectopic pregnancy to minimize any bleeding. The liver capsule was then opened with monopolar diathermy, and the small segment of liver with the ectopic pregnancy was excised using a combination of Bowa-Lotus liver blade (Bowa Medical Ltd). Hemostasis was controlled using Floseal hemostatic matrix and applied pressure laparoscopically. Total operating time was 80 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 500 mL. The patient was discharged on day 3 postoperatively, and follow-up serum hCG excluded residual trophoblastic disease. On review of the clinical case, earlier imaging of the upper abdomen when confronted by a persistent pregnancy of unknown location with high levels of serum hCG would have prevented the second laparoscopy, laparotomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy. In similar cases, it would also help exclude poorly differentiated malignancies as a source of serum hCG. Only 27 cases of ectopic pregnancy on the liver have been identified in English literature since 1952, based on a MEDLINE and Embase enquiry and further review of all case reports by the authors to avoid duplicates. Estimated incidence of hepatic implantation is 1 in 15 000 pregnancies; 4 case reports of laparoscopic liver resection have been identified and another case managed by suction from the liver surface [1,2]. The key principle demonstrated is to resect the ectopic pregnancy with a safe margin of liver tissue and any adhesions to avoid catastrophic bleeding from direct handling of the ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the clinical features and treatment strategies applied to the patients with ectopic pregnancy admitted to our tertiary care center before and during the pandemic. Women aged 18-45 years, who were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in the pre- and postpandemic periods, were included in this case-control study. A total of 173 patients, 116 patients before the pandemic and 57 patients during the pandemic, were included in the study. The rate of admissions from the emergency department was higher during the pandemic than before the pandemic (P = 0.003). The rupture was detected significantly higher during the outbreak (13/116 [11.2%]) than before the pandemic (16/57 [28.1%]) (P = 0.009). While conservative treatment was applied more frequently in the prepandemic period, it was observed that patients were treated surgically more frequently during the pandemic period (P = 0.003). While laparoscopic surgery was preferred before the pandemic, laparotomy was applied to all patients during the pandemic (P < 0.001). In the first wave of the outbreak, there were delays in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancies, and these patients presented with ruptures more frequently than before the pandemic. Furthermore, surgical treatment methods were used more than conservative therapies during the outbreak."

We present a case report of a 63-year-old postmenopausal woman who presented a massive abdominal mass with pain that gradually increased during the previous 12 months. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis suggested a 16.6 cm × 14 cm × 13 cm originating from the right ovary. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy, and partial omentectomy were performed in an emergency as the patient's symptoms worsened. A massive cyst was visualized from the right ovary, which had undergone a torsion of three turns. Histopathological analysis revealed a serous cystadenoma. The twisted ovarian cyst typically manifests as an acute abdomen, although there are cases where this presentation can cause a significant delay in diagnosis. Therefore, high clinical suspicion is often necessary to prevent morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Cornual pregnancy is an infrequent form of ectopic pregnancy characterised by the implantation of the embryo at the intersection between the fallopian tube and the uterus. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is higher in the ampullary region of the fallopian tube. Nevertheless, cornual (interstitial) pregnancy is observed in approximately 2-4% of cases involving ectopic pregnancies. A cornual gestation is considered to be a highly perilous and potentially life-threatening form of ectopic pregnancy, with a mortality rate that is two to five times more than that of other types of ectopic pregnancies. Due to the myometrium's capacity for stretching, the presentation of these cases typically occurs at a later stage, typically between seven and 12 weeks of gestation. Haemodynamic instability is typically observed in patients with ruptured cornual ectopic pregnancy. This study presents a case of a 40-year-old woman, G5P4L1D3, who arrived at the labour room of GMERS (Gujarat Medical Education & Research Society) Medical College and Hospital, Valsad, experiencing shock at eight weeks of gestation. Based on the clinical examination and ultrasound report, a preliminary diagnosis of ruptured cornual ectopic was established. The patient was resuscitated followed by an emergency laparotomy as a critical intervention to preserve their life. The primary approach for addressing maternal mortality caused by cornual pregnancy involves early detection and intervention."

    "abstract": "Pregnant women infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more likely to experience preterm birth and their neonates are more likely to be stillborn or admitted to a neonatal unit. The World Health Organization declared in May 2023 an end to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a global health emergency. However, pregnant women are still becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and there is limited information available regarding the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes. We conducted this systematic review to determine the prevalence of early pregnancy loss in women with SARS-Cov-2 infection and compare the risk to pregnant women without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our systematic review is based on a prospectively registered protocol. The search of PregCov19 consortium was supplemented with an extra electronic search specifically on pregnancy loss in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 10 March 2023 in PubMed, Google Scholar, and LitCovid. We included retrospective and prospective studies of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, provided that they contained information on pregnancy losses in the first and/or second trimester. Primary outcome was miscarriage defined as a pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of gestation, however, studies that reported loss up to 22 or 24 weeks were also included. Additionally, we report on studies that defined the pregnancy loss to occur at the first and/or second trimester of pregnancy without specifying gestational age, and for second trimester miscarriage only when the study presented stillbirths and/or foetal losses separately from miscarriages. Data were stratified into first and second trimester. Secondary outcomes were ectopic pregnancy (any extra-uterine pregnancy), and termination of pregnancy. At least three researchers independently extracted the data and assessed study quality. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and risk differences (RDs) with corresponding 95% CI and pooled the data using random effects meta-analysis. To estimate risk prevalence, we performed meta-analysis on proportions. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2. We included 120 studies comprising a total of 168 444 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection; of which 18 233 women were in their first or second trimester of pregnancy. Evidence level was considered to be of low to moderate certainty, mostly owing to selection bias. We did not find evidence of an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and miscarriage (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81-1.48; I2 = 0.0%; RD 0.0012, 95% CI -0.0103 to 0.0127; I2 = 0%; 9 studies, 4439 women). Miscarriage occurred in 9.9% (95% CI 6.2-14.0%; I2 = 68%; 46 studies, 1797 women) of the women with SARS CoV-2 infection in their first trimester and in 1.2% (95% CI 0.3-2.4%; I2 = 34%; 33 studies; 3159 women) in the second trimester. The proportion of ectopic pregnancies in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.4% (95% CI 0.02-4.2%; I2 = 66%; 14 studies, 950 women). Termination of pregnancy occurred in 0.6% of the women (95% CI 0.01-1.6%; I2 = 79%; 39 studies; 1166 women). Our study found no indication that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first or second trimester increases the risk of miscarriages. To provide better risk estimates, well-designed studies are needed that include pregnant women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection at conception and early pregnancy and consider the association of clinical manifestation and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection with pregnancy loss, as well as potential confounding factors such as previous pregnancy loss. For clinical practice, pregnant women should still be advised to take precautions to avoid risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a common gynecological emergency that poses a significant risk of maternal mortality during the first trimester. It also increases the incidence of infertility and repeated ectopic pregnancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a difference in the degree of tubal patency between salpingostomy and systemic treatment with methotrexate (MTX), as well as the odds of intrauterine pregnancy and repeat ectopic pregnancy, and the degree of tubal patency in salpingectomy with or without tubal suturing. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to April 2023. Four randomized controlled trials were included in the review. We analyzed the combined data using Review Manager 5.3 software and Stata 12.0 software, utilizing a random effects model. When comparing salpingostomy and systemic treatment with MTX, there was no significant difference in the degree of tubal patency (OR = 1.09, 95% CI (0.54-2.38), P = .83). For salpingostomy with or without tubal suturing, there were no significant differences in the rates of intrauterine pregnancy, repeat ectopic pregnancy, and tubal patency degree [(OR = 1.05, 95% CI (0.41-2.68), P = .92), (OR = 0.68, 95% CI (0.19-2.42), P = .92), (OR = 1.68, 95% CI (0.14-20.33), P = .68)]. This meta-analysis demonstrates that systemic treatment with MTX is an effective treatment for patients who wish to preserve their fallopian tubes without undergoing surgery. This form of treatment can help avoid surgical procedures that may damage the fallopian tubes and improve fertility prospects. If choosing surgery, we believe that opting for salpingostomy without tubal suturing could reduce the operation time and minimize damage."

Salpingectomy is the preferred management modality in recurrent ectopic pregnancies; although they do not eliminate the risk of reoccurrence. The aetiology of recurrent ectopic pregnancies remains unknown but there are identifiable risk factors associated with increased likelihood of occurrence. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman who attended the emergency unit with her second spontaneous ectopic pregnancy following a previous bilateral salpingectomy. She had prior multiple spontaneous ectopic pregnancies: laparoscopic salpingectomy for a left cornual EP in 2017 followed by laparotomic salpingectomy for a ruptured right EP after failed medical management in 2018. Lastly, she had laparoscopic removal of an EP sac in the scar of a previous left cornual EP in 2019. She presented with a history of missed periods, pelvic pain, and vaginal spotting. Her examination revealed left lower abdominal pain, soft, non-tender abdomen, and no cervical excitation. Pelvic ultrasound revealed a thin endometrium and no intrauterine pregnancy visualised. A suspicious complex mass near the left ovary with a ring-like structure was noted. Her β-HCG was (251 IU/L) which plateaued after 48 hrs (220 IU/L). She responded well to methotrexate with no need for surgical intervention this time. This case is unique as it highlights the importance of keeping an open mind when managing recurrent ectopic pregnancies, especially when preventative surgical measures have been performed previously."

    "abstract": "To evaluate the outcomes associated with each therapeutic option for patients diagnosed with interstitial pregnancy (IP). We conducted a multicentric retrospective cohort study within the departments of Gynecology and Obstetrics involved in the Francogent research group. Women treated for an interstitial pregnancy between January 2008 to December 2019 were included. Three therapeutic options were evaluated: surgical treatment (ST); in situ methotrexate combined with systemic methotrexate (IS-MTX); and systemic methotrexate (IM-MTX). Success of first-line treatment was defined by hCG negativation (<5I U/L). Secondary outcomes included the need for secondary surgical procedure, secondary medical treatment, emergency surgery, postoperative complications, duration of hospitalization, and delay before hCG negativation. A total of 98 patients were managed for IP: 42 (42.9%) patients had IM-MTX; 34 (34.7%) had IS-MTX; and 22 (22.4%) had ST. First-line treatment was successful in all patients of the ST group (22/22, 100%), in 31% of patients within the IM-MTX group (13/42) and 70.6% (24/34) in the IS-MTX group. The sole parameter associated with the risk of treatment failure was the mode of methotrexate administration. The size of the gestational sac or the presence of fetal heartbeat was not associated with decreased medical treatment (IS or IM-MTX) efficiency. Either ST or IS-MTX are good options for IP treatment associated with high success rates. A single-dose regimen of IM-MTX is less efficient than IS-MTX or ST. Symptomatic patients with severity criteria should always undergo emergency surgery. IP remains a high-risk condition that should be managed, whenever possible, in referral centers to potentialize the chances of favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to determine whether a patient presenting to the emergency room with abdominal pain and for whom ultrasound access is challenging until an ultrasound is performed, is suffering from ovarian torsion or acute appendicitis. We sought to make this determination based on hematological indices and to investigate the diagnostic value of the direct bilirubin-to-lymphocyte ratio (DLR) in this context. This study encompasses female patients who presented with abdominal pain to Çam and Sakura Training and Research Hospital between the years 2015 and 2023 and were diagnosed with either acute appendicitis or ovarian torsion. Patients' files were screened retrospectively. Key information, including patients' ages, the onset time of symptoms (duration of symptoms), and laboratory values, was meticulously recorded. The patients were divided into two groups: those with ovarian torsion (Group 1) and those with acute appendicitis (Group 2). The study comprised two distinct patient groups with a total of 159 patients: Group 1 (n=57), representing ovarian torsion, and Group 2 (n=102) representing acute appendicitis. No differences were found in terms of age, symptom duration, White Blood Cell (WBC) Count, Platelet (PLT), CRP (C-reactive protein), and Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (p>0.05 for each comparison). Direct bilirubin (DB), indirect bilirubin (IB), and total bilirubin (TB) were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p=0.011, p<0.001, p=0.044, respectively). Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Direct Bilirubin-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (DLR) were higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p=0.013, p=0.002, respectively). The NLR was analyzed with a cut-off value of 4.1 (AUC: 0.642; sensitivity 82%, specificity 52%). The PLR was analyzed with a cut-off value of 116 (AUC: 0.670; sensitivity 92%, specificity 42%). The DLR was analyzed with a cut-off value of 0.14 (AUC: 0.741; sensitivity 93%, specificity 55%). This research highlighted the potential of the DLR index in differentiating between ovarian torsion and acute appendicitis, revealing that DLR levels were notably higher in appendicitis patients."

Ultrasound revealed a large cystic adnexal mass with patent vascular flow to the ipsilateral ovary. Vital signs were stable and laboratory evaluation was unremarkable. Due to an uncertain diagnosis and suspicion of incomplete ovarian torsion, a laparoscopy was performed, which revealed an IFTT and ipsilateral hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.

Clinicians with high suspicion for torsion but lack of evidence on ultrasonography should proceed to diagnostic laparoscopy. Adnexal torsion occurs when the ovary rotates around its supporting ligaments, the infundibulopelvic and utero-ovarian (UO) ligaments, often causing disruption of blood supply. This pathology often presents with acute pelvic pain and is a gynecologic surgical emergency. Diagnosis is typically made with Doppler ultrasound, although dual blood supply to the ovary poses additional diagnostic challenges and sensitivity of this tool is debated.

    "abstract": "In female patients, acute pelvic pain can be caused by gynaecological, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract pathologies. Due to the variety of diagnostic possibilities, the correct assessment of these patients may be challenging. The most frequent gynaecological causes of acute pelvic pain in non-pregnant women are pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion, and degeneration or torsion of uterine leiomyomas. On the other hand, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and placental disorders are the most frequent gynaecological entities to cause acute pelvic pain in pregnant patients. Ultrasound (US) is usually the first-line diagnostic technique because of its sensitivity across most common aetiologies and its lack of radiation exposure. Computed tomography (CT) may be performed if ultrasound findings are equivocal or if a gynaecologic disease is not initially suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an extremely useful second-line technique for further characterisation after US or CT. This pictorial review aims to review the spectrum of gynaecological entities that may manifest as acute pelvic pain in the emergency department and to describe the imaging findings of these gynaecological conditions obtained with different imaging techniques."

    "title": "Normal and Abnormal Appearances of the Ovaries during Assisted Reproduction: Multimodality Imaging Review.",
    "abstract": "Infertility is a common diagnosis that prompts many couples and individuals to seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for assistance with conception. These technologies have become increasingly used in the United States in the past several decades, with 326 468 ART cycles performed in 2020, resulting in 75 023 live births. This ubiquity of ART also increases the likelihood that radiologists will encounter both normal and abnormal imaging findings associated with these treatments. Thus, radiologists of all subspecialties should be familiar with the multimodality appearance of the ovaries and pelvis in patients undergoing ART treatments. Furthermore, it is imperative that radiologists understand the appearance expected during different stages of the ART process. During stimulated ovulatory cycles, it is normal and expected for the ovaries to appear enlarged and to contain numerous cystic follicles, often with a small to moderate volume of pelvic free fluid. After oocyte retrieval, hemorrhagic ovarian follicles and a small to moderate volume of blood products in the cul-de-sac can be expected to be seen. Multiple nonemergency and emergency complications are related to ART, many of which can be seen at imaging. The most encountered emergency complications of ART include ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, ectopic pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, multiple gestations, ovarian torsion, and procedural complications related to oocyte retrieval. These complications have important clinical implications, thus necessitating accurate and timely detection by the radiologist and the clinical team. ©RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Avoidance of care during the pandemic may have contributed to delays in care, and as a result, worse patient outcomes. We evaluated markers of illness acuity on presentation to the emergency department among patients with non-COVID-19-related emergent diagnoses and associated outcomes. We conducted a retrospective study using linked administrative data from Ontario. We selected 4 emergent diagnoses, namely appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, renal failure and diabetic ketoacidosis. We used the nonemergent diagnosis of cellulitis as a control. Our primary outcome of interest was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ambulance arrival, surgical intervention, subsequent hospital admission within 30 days of discharge from the emergency department or hospital and 30-day mortality. We compared outcomes during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (Mar. 15-Dec. 31, 2020) with a control period (Mar. 15-Dec. 31, 2018, and Mar. 15-Dec. 31, 2019). Emergency department visits for all conditions initially decreased during the pandemic. During this period, patients across all study diagnoses were more likely to arrive to the emergency department via ambulance. Patients with an ectopic pregnancy had higher odds of surgery in the pandemic period (odds ratio [OR] 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.55) but this was not observed among patients with appendicitis. Patients with renal failure had increased odds of hospital admission (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.24) and 30-day mortality (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31) during the pandemic period. The pandemic period was associated with increased arrival to the emergency department via ambulance across all study diagnoses. Although patients with renal failure had increased hospital admission and death, and patients with ectopic pregnancy had an increased risk of surgery, there were no differences in outcomes for other populations, suggesting the health care system was able to care for these patients effectively."

    "abstract": "Although rare, interstitial ectopic pregnancy poses a challenge in diagnosis and management. The pregnancy is implanted in the interstitial part of the fallopian tube, i.e., the proximal intramural portion. When ruptured, it results in a catastrophic event; the rupture can involve the uterine wall, as in this case, which puts the prognosis of future pregnancies at risk. Here, a case of a 35-year-old primigravida who conceived after ovulation induction is reported. Her diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was missed; it was misdiagnosed as incomplete abortion followed by dilatation and evacuation. Post-evacuation severe pain and hemodynamic instability, and subsequent ultrasonography (USG) lead to the diagnosis of left interstitial ectopic pregnancy. Emergency laparotomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy, and cornual resection with repair were done."

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to connect the possible complications of early pregnancy (miscarriage and symptomatic ectopic pregnancy) up to the 12th week of gestation with biometeorological conditions while assuming a greater number of incidents with an unfavorable biometeorological forecast. We performed a retrospective observational study using medical data of a single medical center of Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Sveti Duh University Hospital and meteorological data from the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrometeorological Service in Zagreb. We tracked the number of visits to the gynecology and obstetrics emergency unit on a daily basis during 2017. Days with five or more visits were selected and underwent further analysis, during which the number of miscarriages and symptomatic ectopic pregnancies was noted. The information from the biometeorological forecast was then extracted and added to the database. Our results did not show a statistically significant difference between the groups determined by biometeorological forecast in the number of spontaneous abortions or ectopic pregnancy. Also, statistically significant results did not follow the expected trend of the increasing number of complications related to worse biometeorological forecast, or vice versa, a decreased number of complications with better forecast. Our single-center retrospective analysis of emergency unit visits related to weather conditions did not show a connection between the complications of early pregnancy and biometeorological conditions. However, different results could emerge in future studies. Considering the large and high-quality database collected for this study, efforts in researching the connection between other gynecologic pathologies and weather conditions will be feasible."

    "abstract": "Can emergency vitrification protect embryos and oocytes during natural disasters or other events that prevent normal practice to achieve satisfactory embryonic development and clinical outcomes at a later time? Emergency vitrification of oocytes and Day 0-Day 5 (D0-D5) embryos during disasters is a safe and effective protective measure. When some destructive events such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other accidents occur, emergency vitrification in embryo laboratories to protect human embryos, oocytes, and sperm is one of the important measures of an IVF emergency plan. However, there are few detailed reports on emergency vitrification in a state of disaster, especially about oocytes and D0 zygotes. Therefore, the effectiveness and safety of emergency vitrification of oocytes and D0-D5 embryos in disaster states are still unclear. A retrospective study was made in the Reproductive Medicine Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to November 2022. The record rainstorms in Zhengzhou, China, caused severe flooding, traffic disruptions, and power outages. From 17:30, 20 July 2021 to 17:30, 21 July 2021, 1246 oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 155 patients were vitrified whilst the laboratory had only an emergency power supply. As of 21 December 2021, 1149 emergency vitrified oocytes and D0-D5 embryos of 124 patients underwent frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). They were divided into the following four groups according to the days of embryo culture in vitro: oocyte group, Day 0-Day 1 (D0-D1) group, Day 2-Day 3 (D2-D3) group, and Day 4-Day 5 (D4-D5) group. Control groups for each were selected from fresh cycle patients who underwent IVF/ICSI from January 2018 to October 2021. Control and emergency vitrification patients were matched on criteria that included age, fertilization method, days of embryonic development, and number and grade of transferred embryos. A total of 493 control patients were randomly selected from the eligible patients and matched with the emergency vitrification groups in a ratio of 4:1. The results of assisted reproduction and follow-up of pregnancy were analyzed. The embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes in each group were statistically analyzed. A significant difference was observed in fertilization rate (81% versus 72%, P = 0.022) between the oocyte group and the control group. Significant differences were also observed in the monozygotic twin pregnancy rate (10% versus 0%, P = 0.038) and ectopic pregnancy rate (5% versus 0%, P = 0.039) between the D0-D1 group and the control group. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between vitrified oocytes/D0-D1 embryos/D2-D3 embryos and the control group on the number of high-quality embryos (3.17 ± 3.00 versus 3.84 ± 3.01, P = 0.346; 5.04 ± 3.66 versus 4.56 ± 2.87, P = 0.346; 4.85 ± 5.36 versus 5.04 ± 4.64, P = 0.839), the number of usable blastocysts (1.22 ± 1.78 versus 1.21 ± 2.03, P = 0.981; 2.16 ± 2.26 versus 1.55 ± 2.08, P = 0.090; 2.82 ± 3.23 versus 2.58 ± 3.32, P = 0.706), clinical pregnancy rate (56% versus 57%, P = 0.915; 55% versus 55%, P = 1.000; 40% versus 50%, P = 0.488), miscarriage rate (30% versus 15%, P = 0.496; 5% versus 11%, P = 0.678; 17% versus 20%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (39% versus 49%, P = 0.460; 53% versus 50%, P = 0.772; 33% versus 40%, P = 0.635). No significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed between the D4-D5 group and the control group on clinical pregnancy rate (40% versus 55%, P = 0.645), miscarriage rate (0% versus 18%, P = 1.000), and live birth rate (40% versus 45%, P = 1.000). The retrospective study design is a limitation. The timing and extent of natural disasters are unpredictable, so the sample size of vitrified oocytes, zygotes, and embryos is beyond experimental control. This study is the first study analyzing embryonic development, clinical outcomes, and birth outcomes of large samples of oocytes, D0 zygotes, and D1-D5 embryos after emergency vitrification under the disaster conditions. The results show that emergency vitrification is a safe and effective protective measure applicable to oocytes and D0-D5 embryos. The embryology laboratories need to be equipped with an emergency uninterrupted power supply capable of delivering for 6-8 h at full load.

    "title": "Advanced abdominal ectopic pregnancy and the role of antenatal ultrasound scan in its diagnosis and management.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal pregnancy is a very rare form of ectopic gestation in which implantation occurs in the peritoneal cavity. It accounts for about 1% of all ectopic pregnancies and is associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to complications such as preeclampsia, placenta abruption, and oligohydromnios, which necessitate pregnancy termination before term, and the risk of massive hemorrhage associated with abnormal placentation. We present a case of advanced abdominal ectopic pregnancy, diagnosed in the second trimester and complicated by anhydramnios. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed a nongravid uterus and a single live extrauterine fetus within the abdominal cavity, with no surrounding liquor at 23 weeks and 3 days average gestational age. Mother was consented and an emergency laparatomy performed. A premature baby was delivered but died in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) after 4 hours due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mother had good postoperative recovery. Advanced abdominal ectopic pregnancy though very rare, is associated with complications that lead to early termination. Ultrasound scan is a reliable tool for the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy in settings with limited access to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It should be recommended to all mothers at their earliest antenatal care (ANC) visit to help determine the site of pregnancy and guide further intervention."

However, in the absence of compressive symptoms, giant cysts remain a diagnostic challenge, especially in patients with larger body habitus. Complications of benign ovarian cysts are infrequent but can include torsion of the adnexa. Bilateral torsion is a rare emergency that can threaten a patient's future fertility. In this case, we report on a 24-year-old female with bilateral torsion due to a triad of adnexal masses including a 30 cm mucinous cystadenoma, a 10 cm mature teratoma, and an 8 cm paratubal cyst. Controlled fluid aspiration was performed prior to en bloc resection of the cystadenoma due to the emergent nature of the case and lack of malignant features."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous rupture of the urinary bladder (SRUB) during pregnancy is a potentially fatal event that necessitates immediate surgery. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the symptoms, causes, associated factors, and prognosis of SRUB in pregnancy. We searched the literature from inception until December 2022 using the Cochrane Central Register, PubMed, EMBASE, ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Articles not in English and those unrelated to the topic were excluded. The JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for case reports was employed for the risk of bias assessment. The search strategy yielded 312 citations; 29 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility after screening. Five case reports were included in this review. The age range of the cases was 27-39 years. Four cases were in their second trimester of pregnancy, and one was in her third. Two cases had undergone previous cesarean sections, and one had an appendectomy and salpingectomy due to an ectopic pregnancy. One case reported a history of alcohol and drug abuse. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain, abdominal distension, oliguria, voiding difficulty, hematuria, fever, and vomiting. The diagnosis of SRUB was primarily made via emergency laparotomy due to the patients' critical conditions. Beyond its diagnostic role, laparotomy was also the treatment method in all cases. Tear repair, antibiotic therapy, and urinary catheterization were all integral parts of the treatment. Four cases resulted in an uneventful pregnancy and a healthy, full-term baby. In one case, a hysterectomy was performed due to a combined uterus and bladder rupture. SRUB often presents with non-specific symptoms, leading to a delayed diagnosis. A high index of suspicion is essential when a pregnant woman exhibits urinary symptoms and severe abdominal pain, especially in those with a history of previous surgery. Early detection and treatment of SRUB are critical for an uneventful recovery."

    "abstract": "Uterine leiomyomas, or fibroids, are the most common benign tumours of the female genital tract. Although uterine fibroids are commonly associated with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, symptomatic anaemia, urinary or bowel symptoms and infertility, intra-abdominal haemorrhage is an exceedingly rare complication. Often, the diagnosis is poorly recognizable based on the patient's clinical presentation and alternative diagnoses such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst or perforated viscus are frequently considered. Herein, we describe a case of a 50-year-old perimenopausal woman who presented with acute, lower abdominal pain, evolving anaemia, hypovolaemic shock and haemoperitoneum with no discernable source. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed the source of massive haemoperitoneum arising from a ruptured blood vessel supplying a large subserosal uterine leiomyoma and the patient subsequently underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Given the paucity of publications on this clinical entity, the aim of this report is to highlight a rare complication of uterine leiomyomas, its pathophysiological spectrum and its relevance to emergency physicians, general surgeons and gynaecologists."

Clinical manifestations of ectopic pregnancy and choriocarcinoma are the same, and all patients with ectopic pregnancy should be evaluated for choriocarcinoma based on histopathological findings. Adjuvant chemotherapy (after surgery) is the proposed treatment for tubal choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor of the chorionic villi that often manifests after a normal or molar pregnancy. The primary tubal choriocarcinoma associated with ectopic pregnancy is extremely rare and can be misdiagnosed as an ectopic pregnancy since symptoms including vaginal bleeding, amenorrhea, elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (BHCG) levels, and pelvic pain are shared. A 34-year-old G4P3003 woman presented with a one-week history of vaginal bleeding and right lower abdominal pain, which had intensified a day before admission. Clinical and paraclinical examinations pointed to a ruptured tubal pregnancy; hence, an emergency laparotomy was performed, and a right salpingectomy was carried out on the patient. However, a nonsignificant decline in BHCG level was observed, and histological examination revealed tubal choriocarcinoma; hence, a metastasis workup was carried out, yet no metastasis was detected. Six sessions of chemotherapy consisting of Etoposide, Methotrexate, Dactinomycin, Cyclophosphamide, and Vincristine (EMA-CO) were administered without complication, in such a way that the BHCG level normalized after three sessions of chemotherapy. Evaluations after 1 year from the completion of chemotherapy revealed that the patient had no subsequent problems. Choriocarcinoma of the fallopian tube is extremely rare and highly susceptible to early metastasis. Clinical manifestations of ectopic pregnancy and choriocarcinoma are the same, and all patients with ectopic pregnancy should be evaluated for choriocarcinoma based on histopathological findings.

By using transvaginal ultrasound and urine/serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) tests, early ectopic pregnancy identification has improved, reducing related morbidity and death. In our case, a gestational sac was detected during a vaginal ultrasound and the high level of bHCG (63,000) suggested an ectopic pregnancy. Surgical management was chosen because the pregnant sac was on the verge of bursting. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of considering the potential for having twin ectopic pregnancies."

    "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy (EP) accounts for 1-2% of all pregnancies, of which 90% implant in the fallopian tube. An abdominal ectopic pregnancy (AEP) is defined as an ectopic pregnancy occurring when the gestational sac is implanted in the peritoneal cavity outside the uterine cavity or the fallopian tube. Implantation sites may include the omentum, peritoneum of the pelvic and abdominal cavity, the uterine surface and abdominal organs such as the spleen, intestine, liver and blood vessels. Primary abdominal pregnancy results from fertilisation of the ovum in the abdominal cavity and secondary occurs from an aborted or ruptured tubal pregnancy. It represents a very rare form of an EP, occurring in <1% of cases. At early gestations, it can be challenging to render the diagnosis, and it can be misdiagnosed as a tubal ectopic pregnancy. An AEP diagnosed >20 weeks' gestation, caused by the implantation of an abnormal placenta, is an important cause of maternal-fetal mortality due to the high risk of a major obstetric haemorrhage and coagulopathy following partial or total placental separation. Management options include surgical therapy (laparoscopy±laparotomy), medical therapy with intramuscular or intralesional methotrexate and/or intracardiac potassium chloride or a combination of medical and surgical management. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her early 30s presenting with heavy vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain at 8 weeks' gestation. Her beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) was 5760 IU/L (range: 0-5), consistent with a viable pregnancy. Her transvaginal ultrasound scan suggested an ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopy confirmed an AEP involving the pelvic lateral sidewall. Her postoperative 48-hour bHCG was 374 IU/L. Due to the rarity of this presentation, a high index of clinical suspicion correlated with the woman's symptoms; bHCG and ultrasound scan is required to establish the diagnosis to prevent morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) constitutes the most prevalent endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age worldwide. Given the increased risk of ovarian torsion in the presence of large ovarian cysts, polycystic ovarian syndrome could be regarded as one of the most significant risk factors for ovarian and/or adnexal torsion in cases of significantly enlarged ovaries. The aim of the present review is to investigate, for the first time, the association between polycystic ovarian syndrome and ovarian torsion. We performed a review of the literature using the MEDLINE and LIVIVO databases in order to find relevant studies. By using the search terms \"polycystic ovarian syndrome\" and \"ovarian torsion\", we were able to identify 14 studies published between 1995 and 2019. The present work constitutes the most up-to-date, comprehensive literature review focusing on the risk of ovarian/adnexal torsion in patients with polycystic ovaries. Ovarian/adnexal torsion seems to be a feared complication in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Acute lower abdominal pain in patients with known polycystic ovaries represents the most common symptom, while diagnostic assessment almost always incorporates transvaginal ultrasound and computer tomography or magnetic resonance tomography scans. In case of suspected torsion, emergency laparoscopy with ovarian or adnexal detorsion seems to be the standard therapeutic approach with a view to restitute the interrupted blood supply. In cases of repeated ovarian/adnexal torsions, ovariopexy or ovariectomy/adnexectomy had to be discussed with the patient in the context of risk recurrence minimization."

Pelvic infundibulum ligament pregnancy complicated with massive hemorrhage. 42-year-old pregnant woman who did not undergo an obstetric examination during the first trimester presented with sudden abdominal pain during the second trimester. Abdominal pregnancy was confirmed after emergency treatment, causing difficulty in the comprehensive preoperative evaluation.Interventions: In order to save the patient life, we actively carried out surgical treatment. The patient recovered well after the operation and was discharged on the 11th postoperative day. Blood β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels and routine blood test results were normal 1 month after the surgery, and the patient had recovered. Several challenges are encountered in the diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy with regard to insufficient economic, cultural, and medical resources. In case of ectopic pregnancies, surgery should be the first choice of treatment, and preparations of blood transfusion are essential to combat the risk of rapid hemorrhagic shock caused by placenta implantation in the infundibulum ligament of the pelvis. The operation must be performed by experienced obstetricians and gynecologists."

    "abstract": "Ovarian ischemia is a gynecological emergency that occurs as a result of ovarian torsion, affects women of reproductive age, and reduces ovarian reserve. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of boric acid taken in different ways on histopathological changes, autophagy, oxidative stress, and DNA damage caused by ischemia and reperfusion in the ovary of adult female rats. We established seven groups of 70 adult female rats: untreated control, intraperitoneal boric acid group (IpBA), oral boric acid group (OBA), ischemia/reperfusion group (ischemia/2 h reperfusion; OIR), ischemia/reperfusion and local boric acid group (OIR + LBA), ischemia/reperfusion and intraperitoneal boric acid group (OIR + IpBA), and ischemia/reperfusion and oral boric acid group (OIR + OBA). On the 31st day of the experimental procedure, both ovaries were harvested for histologic (hematoxylen and eosin and Masson trichrom), biochemical (ELISA and AMH, MDA, SOD, and CAT analyses), and comet evaluation. In the OIR group, hemorrhage, edema, inflammation, and diminished follicle reserve were seen in the ovary. Boric acid treatment reduced the ovarian ischemia/reperfusion damage, and the follicles exhibited similar morphological features to the control group. Moreover, boric acid treatment decreased the levels of Hsp70, NF-KB, COX-2, and CD31, which increased as a result of OIR. On the other hand, SCF and AMH levels, which decreased as a result of OIR, increased with boric acid treatment. The levels of autophagy markers (Beclin-1, LC3, and p62) reached values close to those of the control group. According to the biochemical findings, it was concluded that boric acid is also effective on oxidative stress, and the AMH level was particularly high in the OIR + OBA group, consistent with the immunohistochemical staining result. In addition, it was observed that the DNA damage caused by OIR reached values close to those of the control group, especially in the OBA after OIR. This study showed the therapeutic effects of boric acid on OIR injuries; thus, boric acid may be a potential therapeutic agent for ovarian protection and fertility preservation in cases that may cause ovarian torsion."

Patients who are undergoing fertility treatment are at an increased risk of developing OT. The diagnosis of OT in patients undergoing fertility treatment can be challenging as they often present with abdominal pain and other non-specific symptoms. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis of suspected torsion and performed a literature review on cases of bilateral OT to review its presentation, investigation, and subsequent management. A 32-year-old nulliparous woman who was undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation presented with lower abdominal pain and was initially managed as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Her pain did not subside following conservative management and she proceeded to have a laparoscopy which demonstrated synchronous bilateral ovarian torsion (SBOT), both ovaries were detorted. Eight months later, she was preparing for her frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle, patient again presented with significant right sided abdominal pain and was found to have a recurrent torsion of the right ovary which was again detorted successfully. Clinicians should have a low-threshold to investigate and rule out OT in patients who present with lower abdominal pain, especially in those with additional risk factors for torsion. Patients with confirmed torsion can be successfully managed with detorsion of the ovaries. Further research is needed to determine the best management option for patients with recurrent torsion episodes."

At 12th week of pregnancy, a cerclage was performed to avoid cervical distention by the expanding placenta. Due to missing experience in CEP management and to avoid emergency operation, we recommended CS in 30th week of pregnancy due to unspecific pain of the patient. Vaginal bleeding never occured.After transverse laparotomy, the urinary bladder was sharply dissected from the anterior uterine and cervical wall. The baby was delivered by transverse cervicotomy caudally of the placenta. The placenta was left in situ. The patient then got prophylactic embolization of the uterine arteries to prevent further severe hemorrhage. 48 h later, ultrasound showed a floating, avascular placenta within a poor echogenic fluid-filled cervical space as well as macrohematuria. After re-laparotomy and cervicotomy at the same day, the placenta was completely and easily evacuated. A bladder injury was recognized and closed. We performed a cervical internal os plasty by inverting the cervical lips and suturing their distal ends on the proximal cervical tissue, resulting in complete bleeding cessation. Although, the patient got 8 erythrocyte concentrates at all, she was always in a stable condition without hemorrhagic shock.This case demonstrates for the first time a live-birth with uterus-conserving management in CEP."

    "abstract": "Inguinal hernia is the most common surgical disease in pediatric patients, and urgent intervention such as manual reduction is needed for incarcerated inguinal hernia. Torsion of undescended testes, inguinal herniated ovarian torsion, and purulent lymphadenitis are mimickers of this condition. If these mimicker lesions are misdiagnosed as incarcerated inguinal hernia, manual reduction usually fails, and edematous and erythematous changes may occur in these mimicker lesions due to manual reduction. For physicians in the emergency department, prompt decisions and familiarity with the sonographic appearance of different contents within an inguinal hernia are important to accurately diagnose these mimickers. In this case series, we present sonographic images of a typical case of incarcerated inguinal hernia (an 11-month-old male with right incarcerated inguinal hernia) and three cases of mimicker lesions (a 7-month-old female with herniated ovarian torsion, a 7-year-old boy with undescended testicular torsion, and a 2-month-old male with purulent lymphadenitis). The incidence of incarcerated inguinal hernia is reported to be higher in males (80%), on the right side (60%), and in infants and toddlers. This information is important for diagnosing mimicker lesions. In addition, to prevent manual reduction in mimicker diseases, point-of-care ultrasound before manual reduction in suspected cases of incarcerated inguinal hernia is important."

    "abstract": "Majority of adnexal masses are incidental findings during pregnancy and resolve spontaneously. They may complicate pregnancy due to haemorrhage, cyst rupture and ovarian torsion. Laparoscopy is the preferred surgical intervention owing to shorter operative time, quicker recovery and lower post-operative pain. However, safety and feasibility of laparoscopic surgery in the management of ovarian cysts in pregnant women is challenging especially at advanced gestational ages and in urgent situations. In this retrospective study, a total of 48 cases of urgent laparoscopic surgeries were evaluated in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy between March 2018 and March 2021 in Al-Zahra Hospital, Tabriz, Iran. The operations were ended in all patients successfully. The mean operation time was 45 min. There were no foetal maternal complications. All pregnancies had been terminated after 37 weeks of gestation. Oophorectomy had been performed in six patients and six other patients needed blood transfusion. Ovarian torsion was the most common reason for emergency surgery and mature teratoma was the most commonly reported pathology. Tocolytic therapy was required in six patients, and all of the patients were prescribed 50 mg of injectable progesterone twice daily for 10 days after surgery. The mean intra-abdominal pressure was equal to 15 mmHg and the mean end-expiratory carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) pressure was 36 mmHg. Intravenous paracetamol was used to relieve post-operative pain. The mean hospitalisation time was 1.63 days. Most of the ovarian cysts can be managed laparoscopically with ensured safety and lower morbidity even in emergency situations at advanced gestational ages."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction due to adnexal torsion is a rare complication that can be occurred during torsion of an ovarian cyst. A premenopausal woman presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and obstipation for 2 days. An abdominal radiograph showed signs of large bowel partial obstruction. Hence admission to the surgical department was ordered. Due to deterioration of the patient, a gynaecological evaluation took place. Ultrasonography demonstrated a large ovarian cyst, which was also confirmed by an abdominal computed tomography scan and thus immediate laparotomy was decided. Abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed due to torsion of a giant ovarian cyst, which caused intestinal obstruction by compression. The post-operative course of the patient was uneventful. Ovarian torsion should not be eliminated from differential diagnosis when it comes to female patients with clinical presentation relevant to small and/or large bowel obstruction."

    "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy is located outside the uterus, mostly found in the fallopian tubes. The main predisposing factors are usually related to anatomical and/or functional disturbances of the fallopian tubes. Typically, an ectopic pregnancy presents with vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain in the first trimester of pregnancy, although it may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, which is based on transvaginal ultrasound associated with the serum beta fraction of human chorionic gonadotropin values, is of the highest relevance due to the mortality risk involved. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman who presented with a four-week history of amenorrhea and abdominal pain. Initially, the diagnostic hypothesis was a pelvic inflammatory disease, as the patient complained of pain during deep palpation of the lower quadrants of the abdomen, and gynecological observation detected malodorous discharge and cervical tenderness. Antibiotic treatment was initiated. The patient was later diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy, which was discovered during a routine pregnancy ultrasound. She was submitted to urgent laparotomy with intraoperative confirmation of the interstitial location of the gestational sac."

It is important for early diagnosis of EP. In this cross-sectional study, 690 women with tubal EP and under treatment with SD MTX were evaluated. Successful and failed groups were analyzed on the baseline, 4th and 7th days of MTX treatment. Data were analyzed using SPSS22 software. All p values of less than 0/05 were considered satistically significant. SD MTX treatment was successful in 584 (84.7%) patients. The mean baseline ßHCG value was 882.35 ± 430.76 in the successful group and 1083.99 ± 1080.25 in the failed group. There was a 19.53% decrease in ßHCG values between the baseline and 4th days in the successful group and a 12.94% increase in the failed group (p < 0.001).

Paratubal cysts are lesions that constitute around 10 % of adnexal masses, and may have their embryological origin in Wolfian remnants. Morgagni's hydatid is by far the most common form. Torsion of a para-tubal cyst may manifest as sudden, continuous, or rapidly worsening pain in the iliac fossa. Ultrasound should systematically seek to identify the ovaries outside the lesion. Isolated tubal torsion can only be treated surgically. Laparoscopy is the gold standard. Paratubal cyst torsion is rare and very difficult to diagnose, but should be systematically considered in the case of an adolescent presenting with acute pelvic pain."

    "abstract": "Ovarian ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a phenomenon that necessitates urgent intervention, which occurs as a result of ovarian torsion, and it is frequently seen in young women. A large amount of free radical and oxidative damage as a result of I/R plays a role in the cause of the incident. Antioxidant agents are thought to be beneficial in preventing this damage, and the potential protective effects of esculetin, which had not been tested previously, were investigated in this study. The rats in the study were divided into five groups at random: control, sham, esculetin, I/R, and treatment. Oxidative stress parameters, proinflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2)/nuclear factor-kβ (NF-κβ) pathway, and histopathological analyses were evaluated at the end of the study. After I/R, malondialdehyde levels, proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β levels and NF-κβ expressions were increased, Nrf-2 expression and glutathione level decreased and the histopathologic picture deteriorated. However, as a result of the esculetin treatment, ameliorative effects in the aforementioned parameters were determined, and it was ensured that they returned to normal levels. According to these findings, esculetin has protective effects on I/R damage by lowering lipid peroxidation and having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Our results proved the protective effect of esculetin against ovarian IR injury in rats and this may be attributed to Nrf-2/NF-κβ axis which showed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, esculetin can be used in the future for preventive effects to ovarian IR injury."

    "abstract": "Acute pelvic pain is defined as noncyclic, intense pain localized to the lower abdomen and/or pelvis, with a duration of less than three months. Signs and symptoms are often nonspecific. The differential diagnosis is broad, based on the patient's age and pregnancy status and gynecologic vs. nongynecologic etiology. Nongynecologic etiologies include gastrointestinal, urinary, and musculoskeletal conditions. Urgent gynecologic conditions include ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, adnexal torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Approximately 40% of ectopic pregnancies are misdiagnosed at the presenting visit. Urgent nongynecologic conditions include appendicitis and pyelonephritis. Less urgent etiologies include sexually transmitted infections, pelvic floor myofascial pain, dysmenorrhea, and muscle strain. Approximately 15% of untreated chlamydia infections lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. History and physical examination findings guide laboratory testing. Questions should focus on the type, onset, location, and radiation of pain; timing and duration of symptoms; aggravating and relieving factors; and associated symptoms. Performing a urine pregnancy test or beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an important first step for sexually active, premenopausal patients. Imaging options should be considered, with transvaginal ultrasonography first, followed by computed tomography. Magnetic resonance imaging can be useful if ultrasonography and computed tomography are nondiagnostic."

Ovarian cyst acts as one of the primary factors resulting in OT. While ovarian cyst torsion with Prader-Willi Syndrome has not been reported before. A 12-years old female was admitted to Emergency Department of our hospital with the chief complaint of abdominal pain. The outcomes of physical examination revealed the height of 150 cm, weight of 103 kg, BMI of 45.77 kg/m2. The patient manifested the special facial features, an obese body, with the abdomen distended into a spherical shape. The fat accumulation in the abdomen significantly embarrassed the palpation. The abdominal CT scan indicated a huge cystic mass in the abdominal cavity, sized about 138 mm × 118 mm. According to medical history, the patient was born with low crying and hypotonia, who has developed the uncontrollable eating behavior since 3-years old. These abnormalities led to a speculation of PWS syndrome, so a genetic test was performed and finally confirmed it, concluding a torsion of ovarian cyst with PWS. With the multidisciplinary consultation, a careful treatment strategy containing the control of blood pressure and blood sugar, coenzyme Q10 was administrated to nourish the myocardium and the application of Growth Hormone was developed. All the above preoperative treatments have brought great benefits to patients. Thus promising the successful completion of operation. The postoperative follow-up till now indicated that the abdominal incision was well healed, without operative complications. This may be the first case report. In the treatment of ovarian cyst torsion, PWS syndrome requires fully consideration, as the latter can lead to multisystem abnormalities, especially the relation to perioperative management, and even fatalities. Genetic testing should be conducted early when PWS was suspected, accompanied with adequate preparation for the perioperative period, the follow-ups of patients should be maintained for a long time after surgery."

The diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was suspected based on a positive urine pregnancy test and a pelvic ultrasound that revealed an empty uterus and a copious amount of free fluid within the abdomen. Significant hematoperitoneum and hemodynamic instability required emergent exploratory laparotomy with findings of a ruptured left cornual ectopic pregnancy. A left cornual resection and repair was done with an uneventful postoperative period.

As the symptoms of this condition are non-specific and the localization is associated with a higher risk of bleeding, early diagnosis of interstitial pregnancies is important, based not only on clinical symptoms, but also on additional diagnostic methods. Early diagnosis leads to better treatment-related outcomes. We report a 32-year-old female patient who came to the emergency department because of pain in the lower abdomen and right iliac region and bloody vaginal discharge. During palpation of the abdomen, the pain was localized in the lower part of the abdomen. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was significantly increased in biochemical tests. Transvaginal ultrasound examination of internal genital organs, abdominal and pelvic computer tomography (CT) were per-formed. An ectopic pregnancy was suspected. Thus, the patient was hospitalized in the gynecology department for surgical treatment. A laparoscopy was performed and an ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed in the interstitial part of the right fallopian tube and in the right uterine corner, which led to right salpingectomy and right uterine angle resection. Thus, interstitial pregnancy is a rare and life-threatening gynecological condition due to the higher risk of bleeding compared to other ectopic pregnancies. However, appropriate diagnosis based on clinical signs, transvaginal ultrasound findings and hCG levels in the blood ensures early diagnosis of interstitial pregnancy, which leads to the choice of medical treatment with methotrexate or minimally invasive surgical techniques."

Although the whirlpool sign is reliable for diagnosing ovarian cyst torsion, technical difficulties hinder its use by sonographers. Here we developed a systematic approach to visualizing this sign by focusing on the fact that torsion arises from the space between the uterus and the pelvic wall. One must determine the origin of the torsion via transverse imaging of the uterus and follow the twisted ligaments to the ovarian cyst. Patients and Methods: Two women aged 56 (Case 1) and 28 years (Case 2) visited our hospital with lower abdominal pain. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed a 7-cm right ovarian cyst in Case 1 and a 5-cm cyst in the Douglas pouch in Case 2; normal bilateral ovaries and the whirlpool sign were detected in both cases. Under laparoscopic guidance in Cases 1 and 2, an ovarian cyst and a paraovarian cyst were confirmed and removed. Results: Our step-by-step method allowed us to identify the whirlpool sign and confirm adnexal torsion, leading to prompt surgery in both cases. Conclusion: Using a systematic procedure helps less experienced practitioners detect the whirlpool sign."

We performed a narrative review based on a literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, UpToDate, DynaMed and LiSSa and on reference textbooks and medical journals dedicated to travel, emergency and wilderness medicine. Relevant secondary references were extracted. We also aimed to discuss newer or neglected issues, such as medical tourism, Coronavirus Disease 2019, exacerbations of co-morbidities associated with international travel, insurance coverage, health care seeking abroad, medical evacuation or repatriation and tips for different types of travellers' emergency medical kits (personal, group, physician handled). All sources reviewed led to the selection of >170 references. Among epidemiological data on morbidity and deaths while abroad, only retrospective data are available. Deaths are estimated to occur in 1 in 100 000 travellers, with 40% caused by trauma and 60% by diseases, and <3% linked to infectious diseases. Trauma and other injuries acquired during travel, such as traffic accidents and drowning, can be reduced by up to 85% with simple preventive recommendations such as avoiding simultaneous alcohol intake. In-flight emergencies occur on 1 in 604 flights on average. Thrombosis risk is two to three times greater for travellers than for non-travellers. Fever during or after travel can occur in 2-4% of travellers, but in up to 25-30% in tertiary centres. Traveller's diarrhoea, although rarely severe, is the most common disease associated with travel. Autochthonous emergencies (acute appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, dental abscess) can also occur.

    "abstract": "Despite the current advances in antenatal care and imaging methodologies in obstetrics, cases of advanced abdominal pregnancies are still reported, mostly in low- and middle-income countries where frequently only a few perinatal checks are performed and where these methodologies are sometimes not adopted in obstetrical outpatient settings. We report the video of a case of a 20-year-old I gravida Ivorian patient, sent to CHU de T reichville in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for management of abdominal 39 weeks pregnancy after routine antenatal care. She was asymptomatic with a live foetus in transverse lie position. The anamnesis revealed four prenatal checks without ultrasound evaluation, the first one at 24 weeks of pregnancy. Emergency median longitudinal sub-umbilical laparotomy incision was performed. Foetal extraction was realized by transplacental incision due to omental placental implantation. A live female baby weighting 3350 grams was delivered, presenting bilateral clubfeet and an enlarged neck. The release of the adherent placenta required a partial omentectomy and left adnexectomy and was carefully removed following active bleeding from its detached margins. The newborn died of respiratory distress on the first day after birth. No autopsy was performed. Postoperative morbidity for the woman was minimal and she was discharged on the seventh post-operative day in good general condition. Abdominal pregnancies with a normal live foetus at such an advanced gestational age are extremely rare, and there are no available videos in the extant literature of the surgical procedure performed. Standardization of treatment principles, pre-operative preparation with imaging techniques (MRI, embolization of placental vessels) and adequately equipped and staffed neonatal units are necessary to optimize the foetus-maternal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Interstitial pregnancy is a rare entity that usually leads to the rupture of the uterus. The difficulty and delay in diagnosing this condition have been reported to cause high mortality rates. Here, we present the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain and hemodynamic instability. Her current gestational age (GA) could not be accurately measured as she was unbooked and had irregular periods. However, by abdominal examination, the GA was estimated to be 38 weeks, whereas by ultrasound it was approximately 28 weeks. It was also noted that the uterus was empty, and the fetus was found in the abdominal cavity. Hence, a working diagnosis of uterine rupture was made and the patient was taken for emergency laparotomy. The patient delivered an alive 1.2 kg baby. Intraoperatively, the placenta was implanted in the interstitial part of the right fallopian tube. The placenta was then excised and right salpingectomy was performed, following which the abdomen was closed in layers. Postoperatively, the patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home in stable condition; however, the baby passed away due to complications related to extreme prematurity."

Here, we present a case of a 25-year-old female who presented to the emergency with a six-day history of lower abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan showed a clinical picture of ovarian torsion, hence, the patient underwent laparoscopic ovarian tissue-sparing right ovarian cystectomy with shortening of the right utero-ovarian ligament for a twisted right ovarian cyst. Intraoperatively, a left pelvic mass was seen sitting freely in the cul-de-sac, which was thought to be the left adnexa that possibly underwent complete torsion in the past, went unnoticed, and got amputated and separated from its pedicle. Postoperatively, the patient had a smooth recovery and was discharged within four days, in stable condition. Three months later, the patient began having her periods, though irregularly."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is the implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterine cavity or in an unusual location. According to the clinical case reports, hormonal contraceptive failures may be related to emergency contraceptives and EP. EP may be treated medically, surgically, or expectantly. Currently, there is no consensus regarding whether a multiple- or double-dose regimen with methotrexate (MTX) or an additional dose could be more effective than a single-dose regimen. This study aimed to assess risk factors and treatment outcomes for EP. This case-control study was conducted in Tehran, Iran from March 2020 to March 2021. The case group was comprised of all EP-diagnosed cases (n = 191). Based on the levels of β-human chorionic gonadotropin, MTX was administered to stable individuals with no surgical indications. Risk factors were assessed through 2 control groups: intrauterine pregnancy (n = 190) and nonpregnant groups (n = 180). The medical treatment significantly improved with an extra dose of MTX, especially in individuals with higher β-human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations and gestational age > 7.5 wk (p = 0.002). Considering risk factors, it is assumed that hormonal contraceptive failures, including both oral and emergency contraceptives, may increase the EP likelihood (p < 0.001). Based on our findings, we recommended an additional dose of MTX for subjects who are further along in their pregnancy. It is also concluded that failure of contraceptive pills increases the chances of EP."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pregnancy is the rarest ectopic pregnancies, with an incidence of 1 per 10,000 live births, and life-threatening because the symptoms are not specific and diagnosis is made after abdominal pain, amenorrhea and vaginal bleeding occur. We present a rare case of abdominal pregnancy in a 31-year-old Indonesian woman with severe abdominal pain within 24 hours before hospital admission, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, dizziness and weakness. She felt the pain increasing since the last 2 weeks and limiting her movement. She has a history of a left tubal pregnancy 5 years ago. Ultrasonography examination revealed an ectopic pregnancy, and she was rushed to the operation room for emergency exploratory laparotomy. An abdominal pregnancy was found, located in the right adnexa with excessive fluid in cavum Douglass and a foetus in around 11-12 weeks of gestation accompanied by free fluid in the subdiaphragmatic, subhepatic and pelvic cavity. The surgery was a successful, four units of whole blood were transfused, and the patient was safely discharged from the hospital. The current concept on management of abdominal pregnancy supports immediate surgical intervention with pregnancy termination, as found in this case, because the patient's condition is hemodynamically unstable indicating hemorrhagic shock correlated with massive hemoperitoneum. A prompt diagnosis and good teamwork in treatment plays an important role for such a life-threatening condition to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality in a case of abdominal pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) is a term used when there is a positive pregnancy test but no sonographic evidence for an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) or ectopic pregnancy (EP). This term is a classification and not a final diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the Inexscreen test on the outcome of patients with pregnancies of unknown location. In this prospective study, a total of 251 patients with a diagnosis of pregnancy of unknown location at the gynecologic emergency department of the La Conception Hospital, Marseille, France, between June 2015 and February 2019 were included. The Inexscreen (semiquantitative determination of intact human urinary chorionic gonadotropin) test was performed on patients with a diagnosis of pregnancy of unknown location. They participated in the study after information and consent collection. The main outcome measures (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and the Youden index) of Inexscreen were calculated for the diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy (nonprogressive pregnancy) and ectopic pregnancy. The sensitivity and specificity of Inexscreen for the diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy in patients with pregnancy of unknown location were 56.3% (95% confidence interval, 47.0%-65.1%) and 62.8% (95% confidence interval, 53.1%-71.5%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of Inexscreen for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in patients with pregnancy of unknown location were 81.3% (95% confidence interval, 57.0%-93.4%) and 55.6% (95% confidence interval, 48.6%-62.3%), respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of Inexscreen for ectopic pregnancy were 12.9% (95% confidence interval, 7.7%-20.8%) and 97.4% (95% confidence interval, 92.5%-99.1%), respectively. Inexscreen is a rapid, non-operator-dependent, noninvasive, and inexpensive test that allows the selection of patients at high risk of ectopic pregnancy in case of pregnancy of unknown location. This test allows an adapted follow-up according to the technical platform available in a gynecologic emergency service."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion in the third trimester of pregnancy is a rare but potentially dangerous non-obstetric complication for both mother and fetus and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the treating physicians. A 39-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 1) presented at 7 weeks of gestation. Asymptomatic bilateral small ovarian cysts were diagnosed at the initial presentation. Progesterone was intramuscularly administered every 2 weeks after 28 weeks of gestation because of uterine cervical length shortening. Sudden onset of right lateral abdominal pain was reported at 33 weeks and 2 days of gestation. Emergency laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery was performed through the umbilicus under strong suspicion of right adnexal torsion with ovarian cyst, as indicated by magnetic resonance imaging a day after admission. Isolated right ovarian torsion without fallopian tube involvement was identified under laparoscopic view. The contents of the right ovarian cyst were aspirated after confirming resumption of color tone of the right ovary after detorsion. Then, the right adnexal tissue was grasped through the umbilicus, followed by a successful ovarian cystectomy under direct vision. Tocolysis was postoperatively attempted by intravenous ritodorine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate administration, which was continued through to 36 weeks and 4 days of gestation, because of increased uterine contraction frequency. The next day, spontaneous labor occurred, followed by the vaginal delivery of a healthy 2108-g female infant. The postnatal course was uneventful. Transumbilical LESS-assisted extracorporeal ovarian cystectomy is a feasible and minimally invasive option for ovarian torsion management in the third trimester of pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a risk of both spontaneous and assisted reproduction pregnancies. The majority of ectopic pregnancies abnormally implant within a fallopian tube (extrauterine pregnancies). In haemodynamically stable women, medical or expectant treatment can be offered. Currently accepted medical treatment is using a drug called methotrexate. However, methotrexate has potential adverse effects, and a significant proportion of women will still require emergency surgery (up to 30%) to remove the ectopic pregnancy. Mifepristone (RU-486) has anti-progesterone effects and has a role in managing intrauterine pregnancy loss and termination of pregnancy. On reviewing the literature and given progesterone's pivotal role in sustaining pregnancy, we propose that we may have overlooked the role of mifepristone in the medical management of tubal ectopic pregnancy in haemodynamically stable women."

Both transabdominal (TAUS) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) can be utilized. While TVUS generally allows for greater detail, it is unclear how much added benefit exists in performing TVUS once an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) has been identified on TAUS. This was a retrospective study utilizing Radiology Department ultrasound examinations obtained in first trimester pregnancy ED patients during a consecutive four month period in 2019. Studies wherein both TAUS and TVUS were both performed were included. Two ED physicians with specialized training in point of care ultrasound reviewed only the TAUS images from these studies. Their findings were compared to the Radiologist interpretation, which was inclusive of both TAUS and TVUS components of the study. 108 studies met inclusion criteria. Amongst these, 82 had IUP's identified on the radiologist report. 69 studies had an IUP identified by ED physician review of the TAUS images, with 1 false positive. Each case of intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) was identified on ED physician review of TAUS. Two ectopic pregnancies were present, neither of which was mistaken for IUP on ED physician TAUS review. There were 15 studies with subchorionic hemorrhage and 3 studies with an ovarian cyst noted on the radiologist report. Following the identification of an IUP on TAUS, the added diagnostic value of TVUS amongst this cohort of ED patients was low. Given the added time and cost of TVUS, selective instead of routine usage should be encouraged."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy begins with a fertilized ovum that normally attaches to the uterine endometrium. However, an ectopic pregnancy can occur when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterine cavity. Tubal ectopic pregnancy is the most common type (over 95%), with ovarian, abdominal, cervical, broad ligament, and uterine cornual pregnancy being less common. As more cases of ectopic pregnancy are diagnosed and treated in the early stages, the survival rate and fertility retention significantly improve. However, complications of abdominal pregnancy can sometimes be life-threatening and have severe consequences. We present a case of intraperitoneal ectopic pregnancy with fetal survival. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging showed a right cornual pregnancy with a secondary abdominal pregnancy. In September 2021, we performed an emergency laparotomy, along with additional procedures such as transurethral ureteroscopy, double J-stent placement, abdominal fetal removal, placentectomy, repair of the right uterine horn, and pelvic adhesiolysis, in the 29th week of pregnancy. During laparotomy, we diagnosed abdominal pregnancy secondary to a rudimentary uterine horn. The mother and her baby were discharged eight days and 41 days, respectively, after surgery. Abdominal pregnancy is a rare condition. The variable nature of ectopic pregnancy can cause delays in timely diagnosis, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, especially in areas with inadequate medical and social services. A high index of suspicion, coupled with appropriate imaging studies, can help facilitate its diagnosis in any suspected case."

    "abstract": "Ocular, genital, and anogenital infection by the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis have been consistently associated with scar-forming sequelae. In cases of chronic or repeated infection of the female genital tract, infection-associated fibrosis of the fallopian tubes can result in ectopic pregnancy or infertility. In light of this urgent concern to public health, the underlying mechanism of C. trachomatis-associated scarring is a topic of ongoing study. Fibrosis is understood to be an outcome of persistent injury and/or dysregulated wound healing, in which an aberrantly activated myofibroblast population mediates hypertrophic remodeling of the basement membrane via deposition of collagens and other components of the extracellular matrix, as well as induction of epithelial cell proliferation via growth factor signaling. Initial study of infection-associated immune cell recruitment and pro-inflammatory signaling have suggested the cellular paradigm of chlamydial pathogenesis, wherein inflammation-associated tissue damage and fibrosis are the indirect result of an immune response to the pathogen initiated by host epithelial cells. However, recent work has revealed more direct routes by which C. trachomatis may induce scarring, such as infection-associated induction of growth factor signaling and pro-fibrotic remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Additionally, C. trachomatis infection has been shown to induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in host epithelial cells, prompting transdifferentiation into a myofibroblast-like phenotype. In this review, we summarize the field's current understanding of Chlamydia-associated fibrosis, reviewing key new findings and identifying opportunities for further research."

    "title": "A national analysis of ED presentations for early pregnancy and complications: Implications for post-Roe America.",
    "abstract": "Most obstetric emergencies are initially managed in the emergency department (ED). The Supreme Court decision of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overturning Roe v. Wade, in June 2022, eliminated constitutional protection of abortion rights, allowing states to swiftly enact laws that can greatly change reproductive medicine. In this post-Roe landscape, the ambiguity and uncertainty being imposed on clinicians regarding the legality of certain interventions may have catastrophic effects. To understand and plan for the changes that will come and attempt to mitigate adverse outcomes, the authors first assessed the current state of pregnancy-related complication care in the ED setting. This study utilized data obtained from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) to evaluate trends in pregnancy-related ED visits from 2016 to 2020 that could be impacted by restricted abortion access and trigger laws. The authors subsequently analyzed the legislative changes and translated the pertinent ones to dispel misunderstandings and provide a framework for appropriate medical practice. The retrospective study utilized data from the NHAMCS database from 2016 to 2020, encompassing an estimated total of 4,556,778 pregnancy-related ED visits. NHAMCS is a multi-stage probabilistic sample collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using an annual survey of EDs in the United States. All data were summarized using descriptive statistics such as proportions and 95% confidence intervals Furthermore, the supreme court decision was analyzed in addition to multiple state laws and legal texts. The findings were summarized and discussed. The majority (79.4%) of all studied visits were for patients between the ages of 18-34 years, capturing those in peak reproductive years. This age group also comprised of the bulk (76.4%) of visits for pathologic pregnancies, including ectopic and molar pregnancies, and 79.8% of visits for a spontaneous miscarriage or threatened miscarriage in early pregnancy. Black patients accounted for 25.7%, white patients 70.1%. Regarding ethnicity, patients were separated into Hispanic and non-Hispanic, with Hispanic patients comprising 27% of all ED visits for included diagnoses between 2016 and 2020. Most visits for complications following an induced abortion occurred in the south (70.8%) and were nearly twice as likely to occur in non-metropolitan areas. Approximately 18% patients presenting with a pathologic pregnancy required admission to the hospital and approximately 50% of those visits for pathologic pregnancies and visits for bleeding in pregnancy had a procedure in the ED (49.8% and 49.5%). There were 111,264 estimated visits in which methotrexate was administered, amounting to approximately 1 in 7 visits for ectopic or molar pregnancy. In this data set, approximately 14,000 miscarriage and early bleeding patients received misoprostol. Pregnancy-related ED visits comprise of a significant proportion of emergency care. As it relates to many of the trends previously elucidated on, the true extent of the burden cannot be predicted. It must be emphasized that contrary to popular belief, Dobbs v. Jackson does not prohibit termination of pregnancy in the setting of life-threatening conditions to the mother, including ectopic pregnancy, preeclampsia, and others, but the resultant uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding the constitutional change is leading to an over-compliance of the law, necessarily obstructing reproductive health care. The authors recommend that physicians be mindful of the rapidly-evolving laws in their particular state, and to also practice in accordance with Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). Patient safety must be prioritized."

Given hypotension and non-reassuring fetal heart tones, the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for emergent exploratory laparotomy and cesarean section. The placenta was severely adhered to a portion of small bowel, the appendix, and the right adnexa with an approximate 20% abruption. The placenta and adhered structures were removed. In pregnant patients presenting after blunt trauma with free intraabdominal fluid and hypotension, abdominal pregnancy with abruption should be considered as an unlikely differential."

However, a paradoxical occurrence of peripheral precocious puberty and pituitary enlargement in chronically untreated juvenile hypothyroidism was first reported by Van Wyk and Grumbach in 1960. To create increased awareness and a better understanding of this clinical entity among emergency room physicians, pediatricians, surgeons, gynecologists and oncologists. Case records of children diagnosed with Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome (VWGS) were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-six girls and 4 boys were identified (2005-2020). All had profound primary hypothyroidism (total thyroxine [T4]: 2.5-33.5 nmol/L, thyrotropin: > 75-3744 μIU/mL). Hypothyroidism was not the referral diagnosis in any of the girls. Among them, 17 were referred for precocious puberty, 5 with a diagnosis of pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging, and others for acute surgical abdomen in 7 girls (painful abdominal mass-2, ovarian tumor-2, ovarian torsion-2, ruptured ovarian cyst-1), acute myelopathy in 1, and menorrhagia with headache in another. All girls were successfully managed with levothyroxine replacement alone, except for the 2 with ovarian torsion, who required surgery. Menstruation ceased promptly with T4 therapy in all girls, occurring at an age-appropriate later date. All boys had testicular enlargement at presentation that regressed partially after T4 treatment. Catch-up growth was remarkable during the first treatment year, but the final height was compromised in all. Increased awareness of varied presentations of VWGS is vital among pediatricians to facilitate early diagnosis and targeted investigations, and to help in the initiation of the simple yet highly rewarding T4 replacement therapy to avoid all possible complications."

    "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy (EP) occurs when the fertilised ovum implants outside the endometrial cavity. An EP has an incidence of 1%, with the majority occurring in the fallopian tube. It has a maternal mortality of 0.2 per 1000, with about two-thirds of these deaths associated with substandard care. An interstitial pregnancy occurs when the EP implants in the interstitial part of the fallopian tube. An interstitial ectopic pregnancy (IEP) shows few early clinical symptoms, hence it is associated with serious or fatal bleeding and a mortality rate up to 2.5%. With the advent of transvaginal ultrasound scan (TV USS), correlated with serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (BHCG) assay, earlier diagnosis of an EP can be established. An EP is often diagnosed in women who are trying to conceive; therefore, the prognosis of future fertility is one of the main concerns associated with this diagnosis. Management can be surgical, expectant or medical with methotrexate (MTX). However, the best approach is tailored to the woman's individual case. The authors present the case of a primigravida woman presenting with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding at 6 weeks gestation following assisted reproduction. Her BHCG showed a suboptimal rise. Her TV USS showed no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy. There was no evidence of an adnexal mass or free fluid. As her BHCG remained static, she underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy. A right sided IEP was identified. Due to the high risk of bleeding requiring transfusion or hysterectomy and her desire to preserve her fertility, she received medical management with MTX. Indeed, research has shown that women successfully managed expectantly achieve better reproductive outcomes, with the shortest time to achieve a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy. This case acts as a cautionary reminder of the challenges associated with identifying an IEP on TV USS. A high index of clinical suspicion is required to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Cullen´s sign and Grey Turner sign are, respectively, the cutaneous ecchymoses located in periumbilical region and tissues flanks along the lower portion of the abdomen. Both have been observed in <1% of individuals with acute pancreatitis, suggesting poor prognosis in terms of gravity and mortality. However, these signs are not exclusive for acute pancreatitis, as they can appear in other identities such as: ruptured ectopic pregnancy, aortic aneurysm, rectus abdominis muscle hematoma, perforated duodenal ulcer, common bile duct rupture and biliary peritonitis, idiopathic perirenal hemorrhage, infectious mononucleosis with splenic rupture, metastatic esophageal and thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, amoebic liver abscess, portal hypertension, and liver tumor disease. Based on the review of the literature, it is patent that Cullen´s sign and Grey Turner sign are neither sensitive nor specific for acute pancreatitis, therefore it may be best to relate these findings in the physical examination to conditions associated with abdominal pathology and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. We report the case of a 60-year-old Spanish female, with previous history of squamous small cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma with hepatic extension in follow-up by palliative care services. Due to disease progression after two palliative chemotherapy sessions, the patient came to the emergency room with jaundice and abdominal pain in superior regions. On physical examination, notable findings included ecchymoses in the right flank and periumbilical region. Laboratory findings showed elevated bilirubin and transaminase levels, as well as a small increase in the serum amylase and lipase levels. Cholangioresonance was performed to discard acute biliary pancreatitis. The imaging revealed no enlargement of the pancreas, dilatation of the common bile duct without visible stone, and a liver full of new cancerous liver implants. These findings were consistent with diffuse distribution metastases lesions, concluding the progression of liver disease."

    "abstract": "A rare disorder called ovarian torsion (OT) during pregnancy can harm both the mother and the fetus. Predisposing variables for the condition include enlarged ovaries, free mobility, and a long pedicle, despite the fact that its genesis is not entirely understood. When ovarian stimulation is used to treat infertility, the disease's incidence rises. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound are examples of diagnostic imaging modalities (MRI). A 26-year-old woman with a 33-week pregnancy presented to our emergency department with acute, severe left groin pain. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable except for leukocytosis (18.800/μL) with neutrophil shift. A radiologist used ultrasound to examine the abdomen and pelvis, and the results revealed a bulk enlargement of the left adnexa. The patient underwent a non-enhanced MRI in order to obtain a conclusive diagnosis, which revealed a massive enlargement and torsion of the left ovary with large areas of necrosis. The patient underwent a successful laparoscopic adnexectomy with preservation of the pregnancy. She delivered a healthy baby and had an uneventful follow up period. The etiology of OT is largely unknown. Any tendency to rotate the infundibulopelvic and utero-ovarian ligaments should be considered as a possible etiology. The prevalence of OT among pregnant women is underreported and determined by small limited studies. Ovarian torsion should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with suspected acute abdomen in advanced stages of pregnancy. In addition, MRI should be used as an alternative diagnostic modality in patients with normal sonographic findings."

A wide range of symptoms, from nausea to ectopic pregnancy, are usually aligned with risk factors like abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, etc. An estimated total of 15% of total pregnant women face serious complications requiring urgent attention for safe pregnancy survival. Over the past decades, several changes in the environment and nutrition habits have increased the possibility of unfavourable changes during the gestation phase. The diagnostic factors, management and nutritional interventions are targeted and more emphasis has been laid on modifying or managing the nutritional factors in this physiologically stressed phase. Aims: This review focuses on dietary modifications and nutritional interventions for the treatment of complications of pregnancy. Nutritional management has been identified to be one of the primary necessities in addition to drug therapy. It is important to set a healthy diet pattern throughout the gestation phase or even before by incorporating key nutrients into the maternal diet. Methods: The published literature from various databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect were used to establish the fact of management and treatment of complications of pregnancy. Results: The recommendations of dietary supplements have underlined the concept behind the eradication of maternal deficiencies and improving metabolic profiles. Conclusion: Therefore, the present review summarises the dietary recommendations to combat pregnancy-related complications which are necessary in order to prevent and manage the same."

    "abstract": "A 34-year-old pregnant female presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding for two days. The day prior, she was evaluated by her obstetrician and gynecologist with a transvaginal ultrasound demonstrating an intrauterine pregnancy at approximately six weeks gestation. After treatment of symptoms and reassuring laboratory testing, she went home. However, she returned two days later with worsening complaints. It was discovered that the patient had a heterotopic pregnancy, or a concomitant intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy, resulting from natural conception in the absence of identifiable risk factors. While exceedingly rare, this diagnosis is frequently missed and associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality if unrecognized."

    "title": "Imaging in gynecological disease (25): clinical and ultrasound characteristics of intramural pregnancy.",
    "abstract": "To describe the clinical and sonographic characteristics of intramural pregnancy, as well as the available management options and treatment outcomes. This was a retrospective single-center study of consecutive patients with a sonographic diagnosis of intramural pregnancy between November 2008 and November 2022. An intramural pregnancy was diagnosed on ultrasound when a pregnancy was implanted within the uterine corpus, above the level of the internal cervical os and separate from the interstitial section of the Fallopian tube, and extended beyond the decidual-myometrial junction. Clinical, ultrasound, relevant surgical and histological information and outcomes were retrieved from each patient's record and analyzed. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with an intramural pregnancy during the study period. Their median age was 35 (range, 28-43) years and the median gestational age at diagnosis was 8 + 1 (range, 5 + 5 to 12 + 0) weeks. Vaginal bleeding with or without abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom, recorded in eight patients. Nine (50%) patients had a partial and nine (50%) had a complete intramural pregnancy. Embryonic cardiac activity was present in eight (44%) pregnancies. The majority of pregnancies (n = 10 (56%)) were initially managed conservatively, including expectant management in eight (44%) cases, local injection of methotrexate in one (6%) and embryocide in one (6%). Conservative management was successful in nine of the 10 (90%) pregnancies, with a median time to serum human chorionic gonadotropin resolution of 71 (range, 35-143) days. One patient with an ongoing live pregnancy had an emergency hysterectomy for a major vaginal bleed at 20 weeks' gestation. No other patient managed conservatively experienced any significant complication. The remaining eight (44%) patients had primary surgical treatment, comprising transcervical suction curettage in seven (88%) of these cases, while one patient presented with uterine rupture and underwent emergency laparoscopy and repair. We describe the ultrasound features of partial and complete intramural pregnancy, demonstrating key diagnostic features. Our series suggests that, when intramural pregnancy is diagnosed before 12 weeks' gestation, it can be managed either conservatively or by surgery, with preservation of reproductive function in most women. © 2023 The Authors.

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecologic emergency which, while rare during pregnancy, is associated with increased risk during pregnancy. Most torsions during pregnancy occur during the first and second trimester, with only 10.5% of cases reported during the third trimester. A 35-year-old woman at 32 weeks and 2 days of gestation presented with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated a large right ovarian cyst and decreased flow on color Doppler consistent with ovarian torsion. The diagnosis was confirmed via diagnostic laparoscopy with direct visualization of the necrotic, edematous ovarian cyst and pedicle, which had been torsed twice. The pedicle was detorsed and the necrotic cyst was resected while sparing as much of the normal ovary as possible. The patient provided written consent for publication of this case report. Data supports that laparoscopy is a safe and reasonable treatment for ovarian torsion during pregnancy. It is associated with shorter hospital stays and fewer postoperative complications without increasing the risk of obstetric or neonatal complications. Much of this data, however, is obtained from case reports of torsions during the first and second trimester. The incidence of third trimester ovarian torsion is estimated to be 5-10% of torsion cases that occur in pregnancy. This case demonstrates a successful laparoscopic treatment of a third-trimester torsion in a woman who went on to deliver a healthy baby girl by spontaneous vaginal delivery."

This prospective cohort study including 18,711 women, was conducted between July 2014 and December 2017. Self-rating scales for anxiety and depression were used before treatment, during the first trimester, and two to three years postpartum. A latent class growth analysis identified their maternal anxiety and depressive symptom trajectories. Multiple comparison and linear regression models were performed to assess the relationships between maternal trajectories and their offspring's emotional and behavioral problems. Three longitudinal heterogeneous trajectories of maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms were identified: resilient, recurrent, and emergent. After adjusting for covariates, children with mothers in the recurrent and emergent trajectory groups had higher Child Behavior Checklist/2-3 scores. Additionally, the participants with a recurrent trajectory had lower education and employment levels and younger maternal age at delivery. They also had a history of ovarian surgery, primipara, secondary infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome, and more embryo transferred cycles, including intracytoplasmic sperm injections. Those with resilient trajectories had higher antral follicle counts and GnRH antagonist protocol. Finally, the participants with emergent trajectories had a lower monthly income, primipara, ectopic pregnancy, and fresh embryo transfers. Infertile women's psychological stress was not alleviated by the ART-sociodemographic, infertility-related and treatment-related characteristics determined three mental health trajectories. Children with mothers in recurrent and emergent trajectories showed higher odds of experiencing emotional and behavioral problems."

The clinical presentation of these anomalies varies and includes acute presentations. In this report, a case of a 16-year-old girl who attended the emergency department with severe colicky abdominal pain and nausea has been presented. The patient was on the fifth day of the menstrual cycle, and her pain was not completely relieved by the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient had menarche at the age of 14 years and used to have a regular menstrual cycle every 30 days. Her menstrual flow was average with a cycle duration of five days. An abdominal ultrasound examination was performed to rule out ovarian torsion, which demonstrated normal appearance and ovary size, and a large heterogeneous collection in the rectouterine pouch with unclear uterine morphology. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a duplication of the uterus, cervix, and vagina. The right hemivagina and right endometrial cavity were distended, consistent with hematometrocolpos. Right renal agenesis with compensatory hypertrophy of the left kidney was observed. The constellation of uterus didelphys obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis represented the diagnosis of Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome. Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome is a rare and complex type of congenital uterine abnormality. Although rare, this syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe dysmenorrhea in adolescent girls with renal anomalies. In this case, the patient underwent vaginoplasty with resection of the vaginal septum to relieve the obstruction. At follow-up visits, she did not have a recurrence of symptoms."

The aim of this systematic review is to assess if this phenomenon reduced the rate of hospitalizations for any reason and to evaluate the main reasons for seeking care in this subset of the population. The search was conducted using the main electronic databases from January 2020 to May 2021. The studies were identified with the use of a combination of: \"emergency department\" OR \"A&E\" OR \"emergency service\" OR \"emergency unit\" OR \"maternity service\" AND \"COVID-19\" OR \"COVID-19 pandemic\" OR \"SARS-COV-2\" and \"admission\" OR \"hospitalization\". All the studies that evaluated women going to obstetrics & gynecology emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic for any reason were included. The pooled proportion (PP) of hospitalizations increased from 22.7 to 30.6% during the lockdown periods, in particular from 48.0 to 53.9% for delivery. The PP of pregnant women suffering from hypertensive disorders increased (2.6 vs 1.2%), as well as women having contractions (52 vs 43%) and rupture of membranes (12.0 vs 9.1%). Oppositely, the PP of women having pelvic pain (12.4 vs 14.4%), suspected ectopic pregnancy (1.8 vs 2.0), reduced fetal movements (3.0 vs 3.3%), vaginal bleeding both for obstetrical (11.7 vs 12.8%) and gynecological issues (7.4 vs 9.2%) slightly reduced.

In this study, 112 OP cases confirmed by postoperative pathology were retrospectively analyzed. Common risk factors for OP were previous abdominal surgery (39.29%) and intrauterine device use (18.75%). We modified the ultrasonic classification into four types: gestational sac type, hematoma type I, hematoma type II, and intraperitoneal hemorrhage type. Among these four types, the proportion of patients who underwent emergency surgery as initial treatment after admission was 68.75%, 10.00%, 92.00%, and 81.36%, respectively. The treatment for hematoma type I patients was often delayed. The rate of OP rupture was 86.61%. All methotrexate therapy for OP patients failed. All these 112 cases underwent surgery treatment finally. The surgical procedures were pregnancy ectomy and ovarian reconstruction by laparoscopy or laparotomy. No significant differences were observed in the operation time or intraoperative blood loss between laparoscopy and laparotomy. Laparoscopy showed less influence on patients regarding length of hospital stay and postoperative fever than laparotomy. Further, 49 patients who desired fertility were followed up over 3 years. Among them, 24 (48.98%) experienced spontaneous intrauterine pregnancy. Among the four modified ultrasonic classifications, hematoma type I was associated with more delays in surgical time. Laparoscopic surgery was a better choice for OP treatment. The reproductive prognosis of OP patients was promising."

    "abstract": "Tubal ectopic pregnancies in the late stages of pregnancy are uncommon, and reports on their complications are scarce. We present the case of a woman who had a tubal ectopic pregnancy at around 34 weeks and developed severe pre-eclampsia complications. A 27-year-old woman presented to our hospital several times with vomiting and convulsions. A physical exam revealed hypertension, scattered ecchymosis, and a large abdominal mass. A computed tomography (CT) scan performed in an emergency revealed an empty uterus, a stillbirth baby in the abdominal cavity, and a crescent-shaped placenta. Blood tests revealed that the patient had a low platelet count and clotting dysfunction. Laparotomy confirmed advanced right fallopian tube pregnancy without rupture, and salpingectomy was performed. Pathological examination revealed a significantly thickened tubal wall, adhesion of the placenta, and poor placental perfusion. The unusually thickened muscular layer of the tube may be one of the reasons for tubal pregnancy progressing to an advanced stage. Placenta adhesion and the special site to which it is attached reduce the risk of rupture. The detection of a crescent-shaped placenta on imaging may aid in the accurate diagnosis, distinguishing between abdominal and tubal pregnancy. Women with advanced ectopic pregnancy are more likely to develop pre-eclampsia and have poorer maternal-fetal outcomes. These negative outcomes may be influenced by abnormal artery remodeling, villous dysplasia, and placental infarction."

Bilateral tubal pregnancy is the rarest subset with an estimated incidence of one in 725 to 1,580 ectopic pregnancies. Of the cases of bilateral tubal pregnancy reported in the literature, most were associated with the use of assisted reproductive techniques. Here we present the case of a patient, without a prior history of reproductive technology use, who underwent treatment for a tubal pregnancy and was subsequently found to have a second, contralateral tubal pregnancy 11 days later. A 35-year-old female gravida eight para two with a history of left tubal pregnancy and salpingectomy 11 days prior, presented to the emergency department (ED) with two days of left lower and upper quadrant abdominal pain. The patient's last menstrual period had been several months prior. A physical examination revealed left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, rebound, guarding, and left adnexal tenderness. Her vital signs were unremarkable, and her laboratory studies revealed normal white blood cell and hemoglobin values. Her human chorionic gonadotropin had tripled from her last presentation 11 days prior. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a possible ectopic pregnancy adjacent to the right ovary. She promptly underwent a right salpingectomy. Pathology findings confirmed a tubal pregnancy, and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for ectopic pregnancy in all biologically female patients of reproductive age who present to the ED with abdominal pain."

    "abstract": "Gestational choriocarcinoma of the ovary is an exceptionally rare and highly aggressive tumor. Preoperative diagnosis of extrauterine choriocarcinoma is difficult due to nonspecific clinical presentation and its resemblance to ectopic pregnancy. Without molecular genetic analysis, it is not possible to reliably differentiate gestational from non-gestational choriocarcinoma. Here, we present a case of a 44-year-old woman who presented to our emergency department with complaints of pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and amenorrhea. Because of a recent history of conservatively managed ectopic pregnancy, the patient underwent emergency laparoscopy. Right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy was performed due to intraoperatively suspected ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Histopathology results revealed the diagnosis of ovarian choriocarcinoma of possible gestational origin. It was classified as FIGO stage IV and WHO ultra-high-risk, and she underwent multi-agent chemotherapy without major complications. She has remained in complete remission after a 12-month follow-up. Considering the rarity of this diagnosis, we conducted a literature review including all published cases of suspected gestational choriocarcinomas of the ovary. We conclude that due to the rarity of this entity, preoperative differentiating between ovarian ectopic pregnancy and ovarian choriocarcinoma is extremely challenging, and without molecular genetic analysis, it is not possible to identify the genetic origin of the tumor."

    "abstract": "Bilateral ectopic pregnancy is extremely rare, with a tremendous maternal mortality and morbidity risk, requiring rapid diagnosis and management. This condition is usually diagnosed during surgery, as radiologists may not pay enough attention to the contralateral side of interest. Therefore, reminding of this rare but emergent situation can be beneficial for both radiologists and gynecologists. Here we report a case of bilateral ectopic pregnancy, which was first diagnosed with ultrasound and was confirmed during laparoscopy. A 34 years old woman complaining of light vaginal bleeding at 6 weeks of gestation by her last menstrual period presented to our institute. The serum β-HCG levels were analyzed and followed during patient's admission. Unfortunately, serum levels weren't decreasing and blood test titration before surgery were as: 851,894,975 IU/l (checked daily and not every 48 h because of patient's status and being bilateral). There was no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy at the transvaginal ultrasound, but heterogeneous adnexal masses were seen at both adnexa, suspected of bilateral ectopic pregnancy. She underwent laparoscopic exploration, which confirmed the diagnosis. Bilateral salpingostomy was done to preserve fertility, and the patient's recovery was uneventful. Even with a unilateral report of ectopic pregnancy preoperatively in ultrasonography, surgeons should always be aware of the probability of bilateral ectopic pregnancies anytime facing susceptible cases, especially in patients with known risk factors. Also, it is an important reminder for radiologists to check both adnexa when facing a unilateral adnexal mass resembling ectopic pregnancy."

An ectopic pregnancy is when pregnancy tissue grows outside its normal position in the womb, and it can be life-threatening. It can be treated by non-surgical or surgical options, and any delay in seeking help can reduce the options for treatment and increase the need for more urgent management. We wanted to assess whether there were differences in the presentation and management of ectopic pregnancies in a major teaching hospital between 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2021 (COVID-19 period). We found that the pandemic did not cause a delay in seeking medical help or cause worse outcomes. In fact, immediate surgical treatment and time in the hospital were less during COVID-19, perhaps because of a desire to avoid admission to hospital. One outcome of COVID-19 is reassurance that we can safely use more non-surgical treatments for ectopic pregnancies."

    "abstract": "Objective. Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency that occurs mostly during the female reproductive years due to ovarian masses or surgical manipulation. This work aims to explore the probable protective effect of leptin on rat ovaries due to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Methods. Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups: 1) control group; 2) ovarian IR group (OVIR); 3) leptin group I [OVIR + leptin (10 µg/kg body weight, b.w.)]; and 4) leptin group II (OVIR + leptin (100 µg/kg b.w.)]. Serum levels of estradiol and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) were measured. Levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in ovarian tissue were determined along with the expression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), nuclear erythroid factor-2 (Nrf2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa (NF-κB), toll like receptor-4 (TLR4), and caspase-3. Results. Serum estradiol and AMH levels were decreased with increased expression of COX-2, TLR4, caspase-3, and NF-κB and decreased expression of Sirt1and Nrf2 in ovary of the OVIR group, which were improved by exogenous administration of both leptin doses. Conclusion. Leptin administration dose-dependently reduced the severity of OVIR injury via modulation of Sirt-1/Nrf2 and TLR4/NF-kB/caspase-3 signaling pathways. Thus, leptin may be used as an adjuvant measure to prevent ovarian damage and improve the outcomes. However, clinical studies are needed to evaluate these results in humans."

Case report. Academic medical center. Here, we present the case of a 28-year-old patient at 6 weeks of gestation by last menstrual period who presented to the emergency department with spotting. Initial pelvic ultrasound findings demonstrated a gestational sac and yolk sac that were believed to be located eccentrically within the uterine cavity. Follow-up imaging was performed 2 weeks later that revealed the pregnancy was located at the uterotubal junction and distinct from the endometrial cavity, consistent with an interstitial ectopic. The patient had ongoing light spotting with mild cramping, a benign clinical exam, and normal laboratory findings. Accurate assessment of pregnancy location is critical given that the mortality rate from interstitial pregnancies is twice that of other ectopics. In contrast, live birth rates for eccentric intracavitary pregnancies may be up to 69%, and some clinicians consider expectant management of asymptomatic patients in the first trimester. The patient was recommended for inpatient admission with expedited surgical management of interstitial ectopic pregnancy. On laparoscopic entry, the pregnancy was not well-visualized because it did not deform the uterine serosa. We present a surgical approach to suspected interstitial ectopic pregnancy that is not well-visualized at the time of laparoscopy. The following principles are explored: the use of multiple minimally invasive modalities (laparoscopy and hysteroscopy) to perform a thorough evaluation of the pregnancy location; incorporation of intraoperative ultrasound; temporary vessel ligation and injection of intramyometrial vasopressin; complete enucleation of the products of conception; and closure of the myometrial defect. We emphasize the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach for the localization and resection of interstitial ectopic pregnancy.

The secondary aim was to determine whether the diagnosis of any serious condition had been delayed as the result of discharge after ondansetron treatment. This retrospective analysis of the medical records of children who had been treated for vomiting with ondansetron in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department and revisited the emergency department within 7 days was performed between 2017 and 2019. We compared demographic and clinical features as well as management between hospitalized and discharged patients, focusing upon potentially delayed diagnoses of serious conditions. Fifty of the 89 ondansetron-treated children (56.2%) who revisited the emergency department were discharged home after their second emergency department visit and the remaining 39 (43.8%) were hospitalized. No parameter of the management of the first visit was predictive of the outcome of the revisit. Five revisit patients (5.6%) were newly diagnosed with a serious condition, with intussusception and ovarian torsion being the most substantial time-sensitive delays (the other diagnoses were pneumonia and aseptic meningitis). Physicians assessing patients who had been treated with ondansetron as supportive care for vomiting at an earlier visit to the pediatric emergency department should consider alternative diagnoses despite initial clinical improvement. No definitive risk factor for readmission was identified, but a high level of alertness to a possible meningeal or acute abdominal source is imperative."

The participants included a sample set of female patients from birth to 18 years old. All obstetric and gynecologic (OB/GYN) International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes were categorized. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were used to assess diagnoses by age group, hospital type, ED disposition (eg, admission and transfer), payer, and median household income. In 2018, there were 518,244 OB/GYN ED visits by female patients aged less than or equal to 18 years. Vulvovaginal disorders and abnormal uterine bleeding were among the top 5 presentations in all age groups. The top diagnoses varied by age group. Diagnoses with higher morbidity and mortality (ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy) had higher admission and transfer rates compared with diagnoses that can be commonly managed in the outpatient setting (vulvar or vaginal disorders). This is the first study that evaluated OB/GYN diagnoses in pediatric and adolescent patients presenting to the ED. Educational and referral efforts should focus on not only emergency diagnoses, such as ovarian torsion, adnexal masses, and ectopic pregnancy, but also common presentations that can often be managed in the outpatient setting, such as vulvovaginal disorders and abnormal uterine bleeding."

In this study, we present a 26-year-old primigravid, ethnic Tigrayan lady from the Tigray region of Ethiopia. She presented to our hospital with the complaint of progressively worsening abdominal pain of three days duration. She also had a subjective period of amenorrhea of 2 months duration. Pregnancy test was positive a few days prior to her current presentation. She reported that she had a history of treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease three months prior to her current conception. At presentation to our hospital, she was acutely ill-looking in pain, tachycardic, and hypotensive. Pelvic ultrasound showed an adnexal mass, hemoperitoneum, and an intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks + 5 days gestation. With the impression of ruptured ovarian cyst to rule out heterotopic pregnancy emergency, an explorative laparotomy was done which was pertinent for significant hemoperitoneum, ruptured left tubal ectopic pregnancy, and intact left ovarian cyst. Physicians should consider a broad range of differential diagnosis in pregnant mothers who present with acute abdominal pain. Moreover, in the presence of an adnexal mass and hemoperitoneum, there is a need to maintain a low threshold for rare but life-threatening complications such as heterotopic pregnancy. The presence of an intrauterine gestation does not rule out extrauterine gestation. Thus, the presence of a viable intrauterine gestation should not stop physicians from carefully examining patients for the coexistence of an ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is a rare pathology. It is defined as the coexistence of an intrauterine pregnancy and an extrauterine pregnancy, whatever its location. The presence of an intrauterine pregnancy in a woman of childbearing age does not therefore exclude the presence of an associated ectopic pregnancy. Late diagnosis can lead to fatal consequences for the mother, subsequent fertility as well as for the intrauterine pregnancy. We report the case of a 28-year old female patient, without any notion of assisted reproduction, who was admitted to the emergency department for hemorrhagic shock. The diagnosis of ruptured tubal heterotopic pregnancy was made intraoperatively. La grossesse hétérotopique est une pathologie rare. Elle est décrite comme la coexistence d’une grossesse intra-utérine et d’une grossesse extra-utérine, quelle que soit la localisation de cette dernière. Nous rapportons le cas d’une patiente âgée de 28 ans, sans notion de procréation médicalement assistée, qui a été admise aux soins d’urgence dans un état de choc hémorragique. Le diagnostic de grossesse hétérotopique tubaire rompue a été posé en peropératoire. Malgré la rareté de cette entité, il est fondamental pour les cliniciens de la connaître afin d’évoquer la possibilité de ce diagnostic. L’échographie endovaginale précoce est l’examen de choix pour l’aide au diagnostic. Ce dernier reste néanmoins difficile en raison d’une symptomatologie déroutante. La présence d’une grossesse intra-utérine chez une femme en âge de procréer n’exclut dès lors pas la présence d’une grossesse ectopique associée. Le diagnostic tardif peut conduire à des conséquences fatales pour la maman, pour sa fertilité ultérieure ainsi que pour l’évolution de la grossesse intra-utérine."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a rare, emergent occurrence seen in the premenarchal population. If detected promptly, ovarian torsion can be treated via detorsion. We present a case of a three-year-old girl whose ovary spontaneously torsed and was corrected via ovarian detorsion. The patient presented with sudden-onset abdominal pain and emesis; a transabdominal ultrasound with Doppler was performed, which led to the diagnosis of ovarian torsion. The patient was directly taken into surgery for correction, after which she quickly recovered and was subsequently discharged. The choice of ovarian detorsion to protect fertility in pediatric patients is supported by this case and by the related literature. The key to safeguarding fertility in these patients lies in rapid detection, which remains a challenge in the pediatric population. By raising widespread awareness of the use of Doppler ultrasound as well as symptom presentation, the protection of fertility in cases of pediatric ovarian torsion can be improved."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is defined as the simultaneous presence of intrauterine pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy (EP). HP after bilateral salpingectomy is extremely rare and may lead to serious complications if it is misdiagnosed and untreated timely. Here, we presented the first reported case of uterine serosal HP in a woman after assisted reproductive technology with bilateral salpingectomy because of bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancy. A 27-years-old pregnant woman after in vitro fertilization with bilateral salpingectomy complained of a sudden onset of unprovoked abdominal pain, which was persistent and dull. She denied vaginal bleeding. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels are difficult to predict HP. Transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated 1 gestational sac in the uterine cavity and 1 thick-walled cystic mass over the upper of the uterus, with a large amount of fluid in the Pouch of Douglas. Emergency laparotomy revealed a uterine serosal pregnancy combined with intrauterine pregnancy. This patient was successfully managed via emergency laparotomy to remove residual tissue and repair the rupture of the uterine serosal pregnancy. At postoperative 4 days, repeat transvaginal ultrosonography presented 1 intrauterine gestational sac with a visible fetal bud and cardiac tube pulsation. Now the patient recover well and is in an ongoing pregnancy. It is noteworthy that HP/ectopic pregnancy is still not prevented after bilateral salpingectomy. In cases of multiple embryo transfer, even if intrauterine pregnancy has been established, it is important to rule out HP/ectopic pregnancy in time. Early diagnosis and early management can significantly improve clinical outcomes."

IUD with pregnant control (OR: 10.63) and endometriosis for case-control studies (OR: 2·66) and tubal ligation with pregnant control (OR: 9.3) were graded as risk factors with weak evidence (class IV). Tubal ligation with non-pregnant control was a protective factor (class IV). IUD with non-pregnant control and endometriosis for cohort studies were not as risk factors for EP. Two risk factors including chlamydia trachomatis and smoking were graded as suggestive evidence. IUD with pregnant control and endometriosis for case-control studies and tubal ligation with pregnant control were graded as risk factors with weak evidence.

We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Web of Science from January 2000 to March 2022. All case reports and case series with full-text English language reporting adnexal torsion in pregnant women were included. Medical history, clinical presentations, surgical procedures and findings, complications related to adnexal torsion, and predisposing factors were independently extracted by two investigators. A total of 182 articles reporting 662 pregnant women with adnexal torsion were included. Most of the adnexal torsions occurred during the first trimester (54.63%), while others occurred during the second (26.36%) and third (19.00%) trimesters. The most common symptom of adnexal torsion was sudden-onset pain (80.60%). Enlargement of the adnexa was the most prevalent ultrasound finding in a twisted adnexa (95.20%). Additionally, about half of the patients had decreased blood flow in Doppler ultrasound (53.80%). Laparoscopic surgery was the favorite option (56.88%), while cystectomy and detorsion were the most commonly performed procedure (29.06%). Expectant management was reported in only 2.99% of the patients. In addition, the most common complications were preterm labor (27.58%) and emergent cesarean sections (25.28%). Clinicians should think of adnexal torsion when pregnant women complain of sudden-onset pain. Then, using ultrasound, adnexal enlargement or masses should be explored seriously. They should take invasive and urgent therapy to preserve ovaries and prevent complications."

    "abstract": "In patients with acute abdomen, especially during pregnancy, it is difficult to suspect myoma torsion initially due to its rarity. However, when these patients have a solid mass in the pelvis, torsion of uterine fibroids or adnexa and large infarct inside leiomyoma are the main diagnoses that must be differentiated. We report a case of uterine myoma torsion mimicking ovarian torsion in the second trimester of pregnancy that was successfully managed by laparoscopic myomectomy. A 31-year-old pregnant woman with severe right lower abdominal pain at 21 + 2 weeks of gestation was transferred. On ultrasonography, the appendix appeared normal but a solid mass (7.0×4.0 cm) containing a cystic portion was observed on the right side of the uterus. The mass had no blood flow and tenderness appeared on the transducer pressure. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 7 cm edematous mass with low signal intensity on T2-weighted image, instead of a normal-looking right ovary. These findings led to suspicion of right ovarian torsion. One day after admission, the patient's symptoms worsened with acute elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) (4.55 mg/dL) and neutrophile-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (10.1), despite the use of analgesics and tocolytics, and uterine contractions were not controlled. Emergency surgery was performed, and the final diagnosis was a uterine leiomyoma torsion. Laparoscopic myomectomy was successfully performed, and symptoms were relieved after operation. She had full term vaginal delivery without complication. The differential diagnosis between myoma torsion and ovarian torsion is challenging in patients with acute abdomen during pregnancy. To exclude ovarian torsion, a comparison with an asymptomatic contralateral normal ovary will be very helpful. When fibroids are found in mothers with an acute abdomen, follow-up of NLR and CRP is related to preterm labor and can be a reference point for considering surgery."

    "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy occurs in 2% of all pregnancies. A primary ovarian ectopic (OP) is a rare entity and occurs in <2% of all ectopic gestations. It may present in those individuals who take ovulatory drugs, use an intrauterine device or have undergone in vitro fertilisation or embryo transfer. Multiparity and a younger age are other recognised risk factors. Diagnosing an OP pregnancy remains a challenge and it may be misdiagnosed as a bleeding luteal cyst, a haemorrhagic ovarian cyst or a tubal pregnancy by ultrasound scan. The diagnosis is often only established at laparoscopy following histopathological examination. A ruptured OP is a potentially life-threatening condition due to its potential for haemorrhage and hemodynamic collapse. Hence, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman in her late 30s presenting with a seizure and lower abdominal pain at 6 weeks gestation. Her beta human chorionic gonadotropin was >9000 Miu/mL. A transvaginal ultrasound scan showed no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy. There was free fluid in the pelvis. She was hemodynamically stable. She underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, which showed hemoperitoneum and a ruptured left OP pregnancy. She underwent a left oophorectomy. Histology confirmed chorionic villi within the ovarian stroma. This case demonstrates the challenges in preoperative diagnosis of a ruptured OP pregnancy and acts as a cautionary reminder that individuals can present with hemodynamic stability. Rarely, as in this case, an OP pregnancy can occur without the presence of risk factors. Despite its rarity, a ruptured OP pregnancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women of reproductive age presenting to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and a positive pregnancy test."

    "abstract": "Oophorectomy is the treatment of choice in ovarian torsion if after detorsion the ovary looks bluish black. Ovarian preservation is advocated by many studies in the pediatric age group quoting the ability of the ovary to recover despite the appearance after detorsion. This study aims to review the outcome of salvage surgery (detorsion) in the management of pediatric ovarian torsion. This is a retrospective study of girls under 18 years with ovarian torsion treated from January 2016 to June 2021. Data were collated from records and analyzed. Ten girls with ovarian torsion were included (mean age of 11 years). Ultrasonography and Doppler confirmed ovarian torsion in all. Emergency laparoscopy with detorsion was done in all with the mean time lapse from onset to surgery being 35 h. All the ovaries were black initially and persisted to be bluish black after detorsion. All were conserved and fixed to the lateral abdominal wall. In one child with an associated ovarian cyst, the cyst excision was also done. All girls were asymptomatic on follow-up. Ultrasonography at 3-month follow-up showed a normal-sized ovary with good blood flow in 9 out of 10 girls (90% cases). Follicular changes were seen in five girls who had attained puberty. In one girl, the ovary was very small sized and flows were not well visualized. Detorsion and oophoropexy should be the procedure of choice in pediatric patients with ovarian torsion. The gross appearance of the ovary after detorsion should not be the sole determinant for oophorectomy."

In order to choose the best treatment option, we reviewed the clinical treatments and discussion of heterotopic cervical pregnancy over the last 15 years. The heterotopic pregnancy was terminated using ultrasound-guided hysteroscopy; however, the intrauterine pregnancy was maintained. We searched for the keywords \"cervical pregnancy combined with intrauterine pregnancy,\" \"compound pregnancy,\" \"assisted reproductive technology,\" \"cervical pregnancy,\" and \"ectopic pregnancy\" on PubMed to include articles published in the last 15 years. The patient underwent an emergency cervical cerclage at 22 weeks' gestation for cervical insufficiency and delivered a healthy newborn at 38 weeks' gestation by transvaginal compliance. Twenty-one relevant case reports were selected. After analysis and discussion, we found that assisted reproductive technology is more likely to lead to heterotopic pregnancy than unassisted reproduction. Most women requesting the preservation of intrauterine embryos opted for surgical termination of cervical pregnancy and achieved the ideal outcomes. More attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of heterotopic pregnancies to obtain the most optimal pregnancy outcome and long-term prognosis. Hysteroscopic surgery is a completely feasible cervical pregnancy treatment option with less postoperative impact on the mother and the intrauterine fetus."

Our case is unusual as the ovarian mass was misdiagnosed as ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Only three such cases have been previously reported in the literature. A 28-year-old multigravida with three months of amenorrhea presented with vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and gradually increasing vertigo for six days with increased intensity in the last four hours. On examination, she was conscious and oriented, clinically moderate pallor was present, her pulse rate was 112 beats per minute (bpm), and her blood pressure (BP) was 98/68 mm Hg. On abdominal examination, there was no palpable abdominal mass, but left iliac fossa guarding and tenderness were present. On per-vaginal examination, the uterus was eight weeks in size, the right fornix was free, the left fornix was full and tender, and cervical motion tenderness was present. Her urine pregnancy test was positive. Transvaginal sonography was performed in the emergency setting, which showed a bulky uterus with thickened endometrium and a non-visualized right ovary, and the left ovary was seen adjacent to a hyperechoic collection in the pouch of Douglas of size 3.5×3.5×1.8 cm, likely organized hematoma; there was free fluid in the pouch of Douglas, and left forniceal tenderness was also present. In view of the clinical evidence of tachycardia and hypotension, an exploratory laparotomy was performed for suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and the ovarian mass was excised. The histopathological examination (HPE) of the ovarian mass showed findings suggestive of luteoma of pregnancy. There is an extreme paucity of literature on luteoma of pregnancy. That, along with the rarity of the lesion, results in it often not being kept in mind as a differential diagnosis on clinical or radiological examination, thereby leading to more aggressive management. Obstetricians and gynecologists need to be aware of this condition so that it is kept as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with adnexal masses. A vigilant outlook will help in preventing unnecessary radical surgery during pregnancy, thereby preserving the ovary and reducing morbidity in these young females."

Retrospective cohort study. University Hospital. Women with PUL. All consecutive women with a PUL during a study period of 3 years were screened for inclusion. Risk prediction of an EP was based on two serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels taken at least 24 hours and no longer than 72 hours apart. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) expressed the ability of a model to distinguish an EP from a non-EP (discrimination). Calibration assessed the agreement between the predicted risk of an EP and the true risk (proportion) of EP. The proportion of EPs and non-EPs classified as high risk assessed the model's sensitivity and false positive rate (FPR). The proportion of non-EPs among women classified as low risk was the model's negative predictive value (NPV). The clinical utility of a model was evaluated with decision curve analysis. 1061 women were included in the study, of which 238 (22%) had a final diagnosis of EP. The AUC for EP was 0.85 for M6NP and 0.81 for M4. M6NP made accurate risk predictions of EP up to predictions of 20% but thereafter risks were underestimated. M4 was poorly calibrated up to risk predictions of 40%. With a 5% threshold for high risk classification the sensitivity for EP was 95% for M6NP, the FPR 50% and NPV 97%. M6NP had higher sensitivity and NPV than M4 but also a higher FPR. M6NP had utility at all thresholds as opposed to M4 that had no utility at thresholds≤5%. M6NP had better predictive performance than M4 and is valid in women with PUL attending an emergency gynaecology unit. Our results can encourage implementation of M6NP in related yet untested clinical settings to effectively support clinical decision-making."

A repeat ultrasound in the ED showed no intrauterine gestational sac, an endometrial thickness of 0.6 cm, a normal right ovary, a normal left ovary with a corpus luteum cyst, a small amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac, and a left adnexal extraovarian complex cystic structure measuring 2.9 × 2.4 cm with a fetal pole. The fetal pole corresponded with a gestation period of 6 weeks and 3 days, based on a crown-rump length of 0.59 cm, and lacked cardiac activity. The β-hCG level at this time was 1,124 mIU/mL, and the patient strongly desired surgical management for her ongoing abdominal pain and unresolved ectopic pregnancy. The patient's vital signs and complete blood count were within normal limits. The patient desired future fertility. A repeat transvaginal ultrasound before surgery showed the extraovarian nature of the ectopic pregnancy but could not specify whether it was intrauterine or intra-abdominal in the left adnexa; so, the decision was made to proceed with a diagnostic laparoscopy. After laparoscopic entry through Palmer's point using the Veress needle and then insertion of a 5-mm trocar under direct visualization, the left exophytic interstitial ectopic pregnancy was discovered, as depicted in the video. Given the patient's desire for future fertility, a wedge resection cornuectomy without the involvement of the endometrium was the ideal surgical approach. Subsequent trocar placement consisted of a 10-mm trocar in the umbilicus and a 5-mm trocar in the left lower quadrant. The Endoloop was initially inserted into the umbilical 10-mm trocar to allow for placement around the interstitial ectopic pregnancy to achieve hemostasis and act as a tourniquet. The Endoloop suture was passed into the abdomen and then pulled laterally using an atraumatic grasper through the left lower quadrant trocar to provide counter traction against a uterine manipulator that was deviating the uterus to the patient's right side. This created an excellent plane for dissection along the myometrial base of the interstitial pregnancy to prevent the removal of excess uterine tissue and decrease the likelihood of entry into the endometrial cavity. Injection of 4 units vasopressin (20u in 50 mL of normal saline) using a William's cystoscopy catheter through the umbilical port further ensured hemostasis along the base of the ectopic pregnancy during removal using a monopolar hook. The cystoscopy catheter was chosen for its length and flexible body to maximize maneuverability. Electrocautery was used as needed for hemostasis. After the removal of the ectopic pregnancy using the monopolar hook, the myometrium and serosa were reapproximated in a running 2-layered fashion using a V-Loc suture. The ectopic pregnancy was removed from the abdomen in a specimen retrieval bag through the 10-mm umbilical port. The 10-mm port was closed using a standard fascial closure device and then the skin of all the port sites was reapproximated using 4-0 Monocryl suture. Two important factors that favored this surgical technique over hysterectomy or standard cornuectomy included the patient's strong desire for future fertility and the exophytic nature of the interstitial pregnancy. Nevertheless, as the pregnancy increases in distance from the cornua, so does the likelihood that the pregnancy will be a normal intrauterine pregnancy, which greatly impacts counseling and management if the pregnancy is desired. Postoperative care was routine and the recommendation was made to wait at least 3 months to attempt another pregnancy and to undergo saline-infused sonography for the evaluation of the endometrial cavity; however, the patient never followed up. This video demonstrates the unique use of Endoloop and vasopressin through a William's cystoscopy injection needle during the laparoscopic removal of an exophytic interstitial ectopic pregnancy. The Endoloop helped to ensure hemostasis, provide counter traction against the uterine manipulator, and optimize visualization to reduce the likelihood of endometrial involvement in a patient who desired future fertility."

In a single-center retrospective cohort study, we compared incidence, presentation and management of EP, between 98 women who presented during the pandemic (March 1 2020 to August 31, 2021), and 94 women diagnosed earlier (March 1 2018 to August 31, 2019). Sub-periods before and after introduction of the vaccination were compared. Age and parity were similar between the periods. For the pandemic compared to the earlier period, the median gestational age at EP presentation was higher (6.24 ± 1.25 vs. 5.59 ± 1.24, P<0.001), and the proportions were higher of symptomatic women (42.9% vs. 27.7%, p = 0.035) and urgent laparoscopies (42.9% vs. 24.5%, p = 0.038). In a multivariable linear model, women who presented during the pandemic were more likely to undergo an urgent laparoscopy [OR 2.30, 95%CI (1.20-4.41)], P = 0.012. In urgent surgeries performed during the pandemic compared to the earlier period, the proportion of women with a hemoglobin drop >2 gr/dL was greater (60% vs. 30%, p = 0.024). Statistically significant differences were not found in sonographic or laboratory findings, in rupture or massive hemoperitoneum rates, or in the need for blood transfusion in urgent laparoscopy. Outcomes were similar before and after introduction of vaccinations. During the pandemic, and even after the introduction of vaccination, women with EP were more likely to undergo urgent surgery, and blood loss was greater. This is likely due to delayed diagnosis."

Classically considered a \"must not miss\" diagnosis, ectopic pregnancy is a common emergency department presentation, associated with a symptom triad of amenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, and abdominal pain. However, varied presentations of ectopic pregnancy or lack of typical risk factors can complicate the evaluation and diagnosis of this condition. This case report describes an atypical presentation of ectopic pregnancy after a reported spontaneous abortion, in which the patient was initially discharged with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. This case provides an illustration of ectopic pregnancy that presented without classically associated symptoms, and also highlights how anchoring bias and pre-emptive closure, among other cognitive biases, contributed to a missed diagnosis."

Those who had <13 weeks of pregnancy confirmed by a recent positive pregnancy test; a digital image or electronic report of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) obtained from hospital database; and a follow-up with a pathology report or a clinical resolution of a confirmed pregnancy were included in the study. Clinical signs and symptoms, the presence of risk factors for EP, the TVUS findings in each consultation, and the hCG levels were independent variables obtained from the electronic medical records. From these data, the pretest probability, based on the clinical presentation and risk factors, and the likelihood ratio for each variable were calculated for their use in the algorithm, yielding a posttest probability. Not applicable. The accuracy of the online algorithm to identify cases of EP using clinical signs and symptoms, the presence of risk factors for EP, the TVUS findings in each consultation, and the hCG levels. The main outcome was EP, confirmed either by pathology report or by the presence of fetal heartbeat or gestational sac outside the uterine cavity. Between January 1, 2009 and December 27, 2016, 2,495 women were analyzed, and the algorithm was applied to 2,185 of them. The incidence of EP was 8.5% (212/2,495); 310 women were excluded because they were submitted to surgery with decision thresholds <95%. The algorithm was applied to 2,185 women.

    "abstract": "The impact of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on pregnancy is not well-understood. During the outbreak, the initial approach suggested by the major societies was to postpone all non-urgent assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments. Nevertheless, the Italian Society of Fertility and Sterility and Reproductive Medicine considered ethically correct to proceed with ART treatments, as the infertility rate is increasing over time, with a consistent decline in the live birth rate. The objective of our study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outcomes of ART pregnancies, in terms of early pregnancy loss, overall success rate, and live birth rate. We conducted a single-center retro-prospective cohort study. Patients who underwent ART treatments from 1 March 2020 to 28 February 2021 (pandemic ART cohort, pART; n = 749) and from 1 March 2019 to 29 February 2020 (control cohort, CTR; n = 844) were enrolled. The study had a duration of 24 months. Patients underwent baseline severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) nasopharyngeal swab; quantitative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) to assess pregnancy; pelvic transvaginal ultrasound; and follow-up until delivery. The study took place at the ART Center of the University Hospital in Florence, Italy. There were not statistically significant differences on implantation rate (pART 0.348 ± 0.034 vs. CTR 0.365 ± 0.033, CI = 95%, p = 0.49), clinical pregnancy rate (pART 0.847 ± 0.044 vs. CTR 0.864 ± 0.038, CI = 95%, p = 0.56), and ectopic pregnancy rate (pART 0.008 ± 0.011 vs. CTR 0.01 ± 0.011, CI = 95%, p = 0.79). Neither first trimester miscarriage rate was different between the groups (pART 0.224 ± 0.056 vs. CTR 0.213 ± 0.05, CI = 95%, p = 0.77) nor second trimester miscarriage rate (pART 0.018 ± 0.018 vs. CTR 0.019 ± 0.017, CI = 95%, p = 0.95). Live birth rate remained unchanged during the pandemic (pART 0.22 ± 0.03 vs. CTR 0.239 ± 0.029, CI = 95%, p = 0.37) and stable even when compared to our center rate between 2015 and 2019 (pART 0.222 ± 0.03 vs. general rate 0.224 ± 0.014, CI = 95%, p = 0.83). The COVID-19 pandemic did not cause a statistically significant change in the live birth rate and in the pregnancy loss rate. ART during the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered fair and safe, ethically and medically appropriate. Patients and physicians should be reassured that ART pregnancy outcomes do not seem to be jeopardized by the pandemic state."

On a total of 122 pregnants with TP, 32 showed acute abdomen, 45 had a TP located in the right tube and 32 in the left tube. In the acute abdomen group, parity, initial β-hCG level, and endometrial thickness were greater than non-acute abdomen group. In addition to this, the frequency of bleeding complaints, right-sided TP, rupture, and need for surgery were higher, than to the non-acute abdomen group. The frequency of the previous EP and methotrexate treatment was higher in those with the left-sided TP compared to those with the right-sided TP. EP rate, in patients with TP who applied to the emergency department with acute abdominal symptoms, was mostly located in the right tube with greater frequency of salpingectomy in open surgery."

The present research aimed to evaluate the impact of the Chrysin (CH) on the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in the rat model. In this experimental research, 48 adult female rats, 8 weeks age and 180-200 g weight, have been categorized into 6 equal groups (n=8) including one sham and 5 ovarian torsion groups (OT+CH groups) that received different treatments. Each group has been treated 30 min before detorsion with gavage of CH or normal saline for 1 week and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) has been injected on the day 5 for initiating folliculogenesis. Finally, bio-chemical, molecular, histopathological, apoptotic and hormonal evaluations were performed. The anti-oxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, ameliorated in the ovarian tissues of the OT+CH groups in comparison with the OT group (P<0.001). Moreover, the level of serum Luteinizing hormone considerably declined and estradiol level (P<0.001), partly enhanced in the rats treated with CH in comparison with the ones in the OT group (P<0.05). In addition, histopathological scores of the OT+CH groups ameliorated in comparison with the OT group scores (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression Caspase-3 and Bax genes were significantly increased while the expression of Bcl-2 was notably decreased in the OT group in comparison with the sham group (P<0.05). Here, it seems that CH is possibly beneficial for the protection of ovaries against reperfusion injury and ischemia."

    "abstract": "Adnexal torsion remains a diagnostic challenge due to the nonspecific symptoms, sonographic features, and laboratory findings. The value of combining clinical, sonographic, and laboratory features is not well established, and controversy continues regarding their value in diagnosis. This study aimed to review sonographic, clinical, and laboratory features and to analyze their value separately and in combination, in managing and diagnosing adnexal torsions. The study included 278 women who underwent urgent laparoscopic surgery due to suspected adnexal torsion, according to clinical suspicion, with or without sonographic concordance. Laparoscopy findings confirmed the definitive diagnosis of torsion. Clinical laboratory and sonographic features were compared between those with and without adnexal torsion. Adnexal torsion was confirmed in 110/278 (39.6%) women. In the torsion compared to nontorsion group, proportions were higher of women with acute abdominal pain in the preceding 24 h ([50] 45.5% vs. [35] 20.8%, p < 0.001), with vomiting ([45] 40.9% vs. [24] 14.3%, p < 0.001) and with suspected torsion by transvaginal sonography ([49] 44.5% vs. [23] 13.7%, p < 0.001). A high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (>3) was identified in 65 (59.1%) of the study group and 60 (35.7%) of the control group (p < 0.001). Combining the latter three findings, the predicted probability of torsion was 58%-85%, depending on the combinations. A simple predictive model based on combinations of clinical, laboratory, and sonographic findings can contribute to preoperative diagnosis of adnexal torsion, with predicted probability of 85%. Our model may assist clinicians in evaluating women with suspected adnexal torsion, and improve preoperative diagnostic accuracy."

We present a case of a 22 year primigravida who after 42 months of successful use of copper-T, conceived an intrauterine pregnancy diagnosed at 7 weeks period of gestation.Clinical Findings and Investigations: A positive urine pregnancy test following cessation of menstruation for 2 months was reported by the patient on presentation. Urgent transabdominal ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a gravid uterus containing a single gestational sac corresponding to 7 weeks of gestation. After a thorough explanation about possibility of viable pregnancy and also its pros and cons, she decided to terminate the pregnancy. Manual vacuum aspiration was done with removal of copper-T. Although ectopic pregnancy is a relatively common complication of intrauterine contraceptive device, it is necessary to consider the possibility of intrauterine pregnancy as a potential complication as well. Although, term pregnancies with excellent prognosis have been demonstrated in many studies after removal of intrauterine devices, close follow up is needed to identify misplaced copper-T and keep unwanted pregnancy at bay."

    "abstract": "An interstitial pregnancy is an ectopic pregnancy located within the proximal intramural segment of the Fallopian tube traversing the myometrium. This type of ectopic pregnancy is relatively rare, occurring in approximately 1%-3% of all ectopic pregnancies. Given the myometrial mantle surrounding the gestational sac, which is considerably thicker than in other tubal pregnancies, patients with interstitial pregnancies classically manifest symptoms later in gestation. Thus, there is an increased risk of life-threatening intraperitoneal hemorrhage upon rupture of the myometrium encompassing the pregnancy. We present an unusual case of early sonographic diagnosis of an interstitial pregnancy in an asymptomatic patient at 7 and 3/7 weeks' gestation, discuss predisposing factors, hallmarks of sonographic diagnosis, and review the literature regarding available clinical management modalities. With the increasing application of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) by emergency room physicians and other providers in outpatient facilities, our case emphasizes both the importance of correct sonographic identification of interstitial pregnancy and the clinical importance of uniform early first-trimester sonography, preferably no later than 7-8 weeks' gestation."

This case is unique in that it was a transgendered patient developing synchronous bilateral ovarian torsions, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously described in the literature.

We present the case of a large left ovarian cyst in which laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy was challenged by an overlying sigmoid colon with dense adhesions. A 47-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasound and computed tomography scans found a large left ovarian cyst and multiple small right ovarian cysts. Due to the size of the left ovarian cyst increasing the risk for torsion, the patient was indicated for laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy. However, the cyst was inaccessible due to the overlying sigmoid colon and dense adhesions on all sides. The surgeons elected to drain the cyst, and the patient was counseled that it was safe to monitor for postoperative recurrence over the next three months. Though laparoscopic surgery is considered a gold standard modality for minimally-invasive ovarian cystectomy/oophorectomy, our case illustrates how it can be challenging when treating left-sided adnexal masses in post-hysterectomy patients due to rectosigmoid and adhesional obstruction. In the context of this challenge, our case further demonstrates the importance of preoperative ovarian cancer screening and favoring conservative treatment options whenever possible."

The relative balance of these priorities was dynamic and evolved throughout the course of management with different outcomes. A second set of themes related to logistical preferences included mental health support, clarity of treatment and next steps, and continuity of care. Interrater reliability was validated with a pooled κ of >0.8. Limitations include that all participants had desired pregnancies, and the experiences of those who experienced different pregnancy outcomes may have been affected by recall bias.

Delayed diagnosis was defined as having a previous ED encounter within 1 week in which the condition was present per case review. Patients with delayed diagnosis were each matched to four control patients without delay by condition, facility and age. Conditional logistic regression models evaluated risk factors of delay. Complications were compared between by delayed diagnosis status. Among 14 972 children, delayed diagnosis occurred in 1.1% (range 0.3% for sepsis to 2.6% for ovarian torsion). Hispanic (matched OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.69 to 4.35) and non-Hispanic black (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.79) race/ethnicity were associated with delayed diagnosis, whereas Asian and other race/ethnicity were not.

    "abstract": "To demonstrate a laparoscopic technique to remove a scar pregnancy. Stepwise demonstration of the surgical technique. Santa Croce and Carle Hospital, Cuneo. Patient B.B. is a woman referred to our center for a suspected cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) at 9 weeks gestation. CSP occurs approximately in 6% of all ectopic pregnancies. The estimated incidence is reported to be 1:1800 to 1:2500 in cesarean deliveries. Depending on its location, CSP can be categorized as either type 1, if the growth is in the uterine cavity, or type 2, if it expands toward the bladder and the abdominal cavity. If inadequately managed, it can lead to severe complications; most of them are hemorrhagic and can threaten the woman's life. There are several therapeutic approaches: local excision seems to be the most effective choice in type 2 CSP. In expert hands, the laparoscopic approach is perhaps the best surgical choice as tissue dissection, electrosurgical hemostasis, and vascular control can be effectively managed with minimal invasive access. Because severe intraoperative bleeding can occur, retroperitoneal vascular control is mandatory in this surgery. In type 1 CSP curettage, aspiration or hysteroscopic approach can be considered if the CSP is of small dimensions. A hysteroscopic approach can also be helpful in type 2 CSP during the laparoscopic removal, as intrauterine guidance. A potassium chloride local injection can be considered in a preoperative stage in the presence of a fetal heart rate. The systemic administration of methotrexate is usually ineffective as single agent, but it can be useful if administered as adjuvant therapy. Uterine artery embolization can be useful in an emergency setting to manage severe bleeding, but it can lead to complications in subsequent pregnancies and, more rarely, to premature ovarian failure. Considering poor bleeding at presentation, feasible dimensions, and the woman's desire for future pregnancy, ultrasound-guided aspiration and curettage was attempted. Because endouterine removal was incomplete, methotrexate injection was proposed as adjuvant therapy, but the administration was postponed as the patient tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019. A month later, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level dropped from over 16 000 to 271 mU/mL, so an ultrasound and biochemical follow-up was performed. A month later, despite a low beta-human chorionic gonadotropin value, an increase in dimensions was observed at ultrasound, so surgical laparoscopic removal was offered. In this video article, laparoscopic removal of scar pregnancy is discussed in the following surgical steps: (1) Temporary closure of uterine arteries at the origin, using removable clips. (2) Retroperitoneal dissection to safely manage the scar pregnancy. (3) Dissection of the myometrial-pregnancy interface. (4) Double layer suture on the anterior uterine wall. Laparoscopic surgical management is a very effective surgical approach to remove CSP. Knowledge of retroperitoneal dissection and vascular control is necessary to carry out this surgical intervention safely and effectively."

    "abstract": "Tubal ectopic pregnancies remain a challenging and life-threatening obstetric condition in the early stages that unavoidably lead to abortion or rupture, further reflected by the associated maternal mortality. Therefore, in the present case report, we report the experience of a 36-year-old woman who presented to our Emergency Department with a history of moderate hypogastric pain, mild vaginal bleeding, and bilateral mastalgia, symptoms that started 20 days ago after uterine curettage for a declarative eight-week pregnancy. On admission, a physical examination showed regular standard signs. The ultrasound examination revealed in the left abdominal flank a gestational sac with a live fetus corresponding to the gestational age of 13 weeks. Given the position of the gestational sac, we suspected a possible abdominal pregnancy. Independently on her human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) of 33.980 mIU/mL and hemoglobin (Hb) of 13.4 g/dL, the exact location of the pregnancy following ultrasound was hard to establish. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was requested, after which we suspected the diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy. Given the paraclinical and clinical context of the worsening of painful symptoms, we decided to perform an exploratory laparoscopy in the multidisciplinary team (digestive and vascular surgeon) that showed the existence of a tubal pregnancy."

A high level of clinical suspicion is required for any pregnant patient who presents with vaginal bleeding and/or pelvic pain. Workup should begin with immediate triage based on vital signs, a pregnancy test, and transvaginal ultrasound. Ectopic pregnancy can be treated either medically with methotrexate or surgically with either salpingectomy or salpingostomy. Carefully counseled, asymptomatic patients may be candidates for expectant management."

Unfortunately, in this setting, patients commonly have negative experiences, in part due to lack of appropriate follow-up and education on symptoms that may arise after discharge. In response to this gap, our team created a free, web-based, patient-informed educational platform for women to access accurate information on early pregnancy loss. This free and publicly accessible resource was launched in May 2022 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto and was shared with EDs across Canada. RéSUMé: Les services d'urgence (SU) canadiens fournissent fréquemment des soins aux patientes qui subissent une perte de grossesse précoce. Malheureusement, dans ce contexte, les patientes ont souvent des expériences négatives, en partie à cause du manque de suivi approprié et d'éducation sur les symptômes qui peuvent apparaître après la sortie de l'hôpital. Pour combler cette lacune, notre équipe a créé une plate-forme éducative gratuite, basée sur le Web et informée par les patientes, permettant aux femmes d'accéder à des informations précises sur la perte de grossesse précoce. Cette ressource gratuite et accessible au public a été lancée en mai 2022 à l'hôpital Mount Sinai de Toronto et a été partagée avec les services d'urgence de tout le Canada."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is an emergency whereby challenges in diagnosis may lead to delayed management. The morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis can be severe and includes loss of ovarian function. We present a case of a 24-year-old female who presented to the hospital with left lower quadrant abdominal pain with unremarkable physical examination. A transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound were acquired and demonstrated a mildly enlarged left ovary and fallopian tube without other significant findings. However due to worsening pain and up trending inflammatory markers, diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and demonstrated a 12cm ovarian cyst, a necrotic left adnexal mass and a torsed left tubo-ovarian pedicle. These findings were not appreciated on the initial Doppler ultrasound acquired but retrospective analysis demonstrated a double bladder sign. Our case report aims to aid sonographers and physicians to promptly diagnose ovarian torsion through the \"double bladder sign\" and other salient ultrasonographic and clinical features."

    "abstract": "The 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is an established, long-acting contraceptive option with approved use for up to 7 years. The Mirena Extension Trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system during extended use beyond 5 and up to 8 years. This was a multicenter, single-arm study in the United States, enrolling existing users of the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, aged 18 to 35 years, who have had the system for 4.5 to 5 years. We assessed the contraceptive efficacy (Pearl Index) and cumulative failure rate (using the Kaplan-Meier method) of the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system during extended use. We also evaluated bleeding outcomes and adverse events. Of the 362 participants starting year 6, 243 entered and 223 completed 8 years of 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system use. Just more than half the participants were parous. The mean (standard deviation) age was 29.2 (±2.9) years, and all participants were aged ≤36 years at the end of year 8. Two pregnancies occurred, both with the device in situ. The year 6 pregnancy was of undetermined location and resolved spontaneously. The pregnancy in year 7 was ectopic and resolved with methotrexate treatment. In both cases, the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system was removed and the participants left the trial. For years 6 to 8, the 3-year Pearl Index (95% confidence interval) was 0.28 (0.03-1.00) with a 3-year cumulative failure rate of 0.68% (0.17-2.71). Pearl Indexes for years 6, 7, and 8 were 0.34 (0.01-1.88), 0.40 (0.01-2.25), and 0.00 (0.00-1.90), respectively. The 3-year (years 6-8) ectopic pregnancy Pearl Index was 0.14 (0.00-0.77). We found treatment-emergent adverse events in 249 of 362 participants (68.8%), with 65 (18.0%) events considered to be related to the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. The discontinuation rate was 38.4% (139/362), most commonly because of desire for pregnancy (12.2%, 44/362). During extended use beyond 5 years and up to 8 years, participants reported a decrease in the mean number of bleeding or spotting days with approximately half of the women experiencing amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding. We did not enroll a sufficient number of women using the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for contraception and heavy menstrual bleeding to assess extended use for that indication. At the end of year 8, most (98.7%, 220/223) of the participants who completed the study remained satisfied with the continued use of the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Of the 31 women who discontinued early because of desire for pregnancy with evaluable data for return-to-fertility analysis, 24 reported a posttreatment pregnancy within 1 year, giving a 12-month return-to-fertility rate of 77.4%. The 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, initially approved for 5 years, maintains high contraceptive efficacy, user satisfaction, and a favorable safety profile through 8 years of use. Participants reported 26 posttreatment pregnancies in total, of which 24 occurred in women who had discontinued the 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system because of a desire for pregnancy. Of note, among women who elected to continue use through 8 years, bleeding patterns remained highly favorable. These findings support continued 52-mg levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system use for up to 8 years in women who wish to continue treatment."

    "abstract": "The primary concern of emergency physicians (EPs) in symptomatic patients in their early pregnancy is to rule out ectopic pregnancy by identifying a definite intrauterine pregnancy (IUP). Then an assessment of viability is required for the IUPs. Although transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) stands as the best modality for these patients, it is not available in most emergency settings. This study aimed to investigate the effects of high-frequency linear transducers (HFLT) on the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for detection of IUP and the agreement between EPs and obstetricians for patients' diagnosis. A convenience sample of pregnant patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with vaginal bleeding and abdominopelvic pain was included. The characteristics of diagnostic tests of transabdominal POCUS performed by EPs were compared to TVUS. The study population was finalized as 143 patients. For the definite IUP, the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS was 93.0%, with a sensitivity of 89.0%, a specificity of 100%, compared to an accuracy of 97.9% for POCUS plus HFLT with a sensitivity of 96.7%, a specificity of 100%. For the identification of fetal cardiac activity (FCA), utilizing HFLT improved the diagnostic accuracy to 97.9% (from 94.4%) and sensitivity to 95.5% (from 88.1%). In addition, the agreement between the EPs and obstetricians concerning the classification of ED diagnosis was excellent (agreement: 96.5%, kappa: 0.943, p < 0.0001). POCUS plus HFLT performed by EPs in evaluating symptomatic patients in their first-trimester pregnancy improves the accuracy to a non-inferior level compared to TVUS performed by obstetricians. Hence, EPs can securely rely on POCUS to confirm IUP and FCA. However, they should be cautious about using it as a rule-out tool. Moreover, HFLT use could enhance the accuracy of POCUS in viability assessment as an alternative to TVUS."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a relatively common condition and an important cause of morbidity in women of childbearing age. The most frequent implantation site is the fallopian tube. Most cases are diagnosed in an early gestational period. Patients come to the attention of clinicians for pelvic pain and vaginal blood loss, and consequent diagnosis is made through clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and ultrasound. Other rarer implantation sites such as the abdominal cavity give space for ectopic pregnancy to grow until later gestational ages, delaying diagnosis. This is a rare case of a healthy 41-year-old woman with an advanced ectopic pregnancy after emergency contraception with Ulipristal Acetate. The patient went to visit for amenorrhea after taking a contraceptive. Evaluation with ultrasound demonstrated a 10 + 4 weeks' unruptured tubal pregnancy with fetal heart rate. The patient underwent laparoscopic salpingectomy without complication. This is the first case of such an advanced ectopic pregnancy in a woman who performed emergency contraception with Ulipristal Acetate."

We summarized the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of luteoma in a woman with IVF twin pregnancy and reviewed the relevant literature. We report the case of a 34-year-old Asian female who became pregnant through in vitro fertilization (IVF) and had acute right underbelly pain at 26 weeks and 6 days of gestation, which was misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis. Written consent was obtained from the patient. After fasting for a short duration and receiving anti-inflammatory and intravenous fluid replacement treatment after admission, the woman experienced increased right lower abdominal pain without relief and decreased fetal movement. B-ultrasound and CT examination showed that luteoma torsion was possible, and we performed emergency surgical laparotomy. During the operation, it was found that the right ovary was enlarged, the fallopian tube was twisted 720 degrees, and there was no lesion in the appendix. The right necrotic ovary was removed, and pathological results showed a hemorrhagic corpus luteum in the right ovary. The patient's abdominal pain was relieved after the operation and the pregnancy was continued. This is a typical case of ovariectomy associated with a luteoma of pregnancy. Whether in vitro fertilization and related procedures increase the risk of luteoma and whether they increase the risk of ovarian torsion necrosis in the case of luteoma formation are questions that need further study."

Twenty-four, Wistar Hannover rats were included. The rats were divided into three groups as control, detorsion-only, and ozone therapy + detorsion groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the follicular damage and inflammation scores between the study groups (p = .019, p = .002, respectively). The highest AMH decrease was observed in the detorsion-only group (p = .012). The total damage score was higher in the detorsion-only group than the ozone therapy + detorsion group. Preantral, small and large antral follicle numbers were less in the detorsion-only group than the ozone therapy + detorsion group. The highest postoperative day 7 TAS level was in the ozone therapy + detorsion group. TOS levels did not differ significantly between the study groups. The combination of the ozone therapy with ovarian detorsion is more effective in protecting the ovarian reserve than ovarian detorsion-only.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Adnexal torsion is a common gynecological emergency in reproductive-age women. The recommended management is the detorsion of the adnexal pedicle in patients with fertility desire.What do the results of this study add? The combination of the medical ozone therapy with conventional surgical ovarian detorsion is more effective in the protection of the ovarian reserve compared to surgical ovarian detorsion.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This study speculates that medical ozone therapy in addition to conventional surgical ovarian detorsion could preserve ovarian reserve and function if confirmed in further clinical studies."

    "abstract": "An acute ectopic pregnancy is one of the most common gynaecological emergencies in clinical practice. The diagnosis is usually established by a combination of clinical examination findings, correlated with sonographic and laboratory results. However, a chronic ectopic pregnancy (CEP) may occur when the ectopically implanted gestation, mostly in the fallopian tubes, invades the underlying structures, causing protracted destruction at the site of implantation. Individuals may present with subacute or chronic abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, amenorrhoea and a low bHCG. The correct diagnosis is often only established following laparoscopy or even histologically after the operation. The authors present the case of a woman in her 30 s presenting with severe right sided abdominal pain and a failing pregnancy at 10 weeks gestation. Her urine pregnancy test was negative, but her serum bHCG was 18 IU/L. A transvaginal ultrasound scan confirmed a ruptured right tubal ectopic pregnancy. A laparoscopic salpingectomy was performed. This case provides an important reminder that a CEP should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of women of reproductive age presenting with acute lower abdominal pain, despite a negative urine pregnancy test."

Ultimately, embolisation was performed in the interventional radiology suite, with improvement of patient haemodynamics. Ruptured AML is a rare, life-threatening condition that needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of haemorrhagic shock in female patients of reproductive age presenting to the emergency department."

Challenges encountered in diagnosis, pre-operative evaluation, decision for surgery and the procedure are presented. This is a series of twelve cases of uncommon ectopic pregnancies belonging to eight different types. These were managed under the first author during the period 2001 to 2019. Subjects were analyzed retrospectively. Diagnostic dilemma was faced in majority of the cases even with the use of ultrasonography. All the conceptions were spontaneous. Emergency surgical interventions were made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Five cases presented with massive hemoperitoneum. Blood transfusion was needed in nine cases. There was no mortality. One woman (case 4), with abdominal pregnancy, went home with a live baby, after the second laparotomy. Uncommon ectopic pregnancies are life-threatening conditions. Clinical acumen and an alert mind are of superior value in diagnosis. Investigations are supportive. Early diagnosis and intervention are lifesaving."

    "abstract": "Interstitial pregnancy (IP) is a type of ectopic pregnancy in which the embryo implants in the interstitial part of the Fallopian tube. It accounts for 2% of all ectopic pregnancies. Signs and symptoms appear later than the other forms of ectopic pregnancies because of its peculiar location. The gold standard for its diagnosis is transvaginal ultrasound. The treatment can be medical or surgical. Medical treatment is based on the systemic or local injection of methotrexate (MTX); a dose of mifepristone can be added with a reported 85-90% success rate. The surgical option is laparoscopic unilateral cornuostomy or unilateral salpingectomy. The therapeutic choice is based on symptoms, serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) values, and sonographic features. Furthermore, the patient's fertility perspectives should be considered. We report a case of IP in a Caucasian woman of 29 years old, with a previous salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy medically treated by a double dose of intramuscular MTX 50 mg/m2 combined with a single dose of leucovorin 15 mg and a single dose of mifepristone 600 mg orally. Medical therapy failed as suggested by the sudden onset of intense pelvic pain after 10 days. Because of the clinical symptoms and the sonographic suspicious of pregnancy rupture due to the modest amount of fluid in the pouch of Douglas, clinicians decided on an urgent unilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy. The hemoperitoneum was drained. The patient was discharged two days later and β-hCG serum levels became negative after 45 days. The advantages of fertility sparing should be weighted according to the patient's reproductive perspectives. Appropriate counseling is therefore key in managing the treatment of interstitial pregnancy."

No edit RESULTS: Twenty patients had torsion, while 24 patients did not. Patients with dermoid-associated torsion were more likely to present to emergency department (ED) (100% vs 13%; p < 0.001) and have acute unilateral pelvic pain (100% vs 42%; p < 0.001). On ultrasound, patients with torsion had larger dermoids (median largest dimension 9.0 cm (IQR 7.7-11.1) vs 6.0 cm (IQR 4.4-7.5); p < 0.001), displaced dermoid anterior or superior to the uterus (59% vs 21%; p = 0.016), and ipsilateral adnexal fluid (41% vs 4%; p = 0.003). Displaced dermoid and ipsilateral adnexal fluid had substantial (kappa = 0.72) and moderate inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.49), respectively. The combination of ED presentation and each statistically significant ultrasound feature (dermoid size ≥ 5.0 cm, displaced dermoid, and ipsilateral adnexal fluid) yielded high specificity and positive predictive value (ranging from 93-100% to 92-100%, respectively).

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is defined as twisting of the ovary around an axis consisting of its vascular pedicle, the infundibulopelvic ligament and the tubo-ovarian ligament, and can occur in females of any age. Torsion can be a result of ovarian mass causing asymmetry and subsequent torsion, or can be spontaneous. While ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, early diagnosis and treatment can preserve ovarian viability even if necrosis is seen operatively. Presentation classically involves sudden onset severe abdominal pain and vomiting but diagnostic delay can follow subtler presentations. Diagnosis is most commonly based on sonographic findings, but advanced imaging such as CT or MRI may be required if sonography is not diagnostic. Treatment is surgical, with ovarian preservation preferred in almost all cases. In this review, I present the most recent evidence on epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of pediatric ovarian torsion, with a focus on point-of-care ultrasound for the emergency care provider."

Pelvic artery embolization (PAE) represents a minimally invasive interventional procedure which plays an important role in conservative management of significant bleeding in Obstetrics and Gynecology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect and the complications of PAE in patients with significant vaginal bleeding with different obstetrical and gynecological pathologies. (2) Methods: We conducted an observational, retrospective study on 1135 patients who presented to the University Emergency Hospital of Bucharest with vaginal bleeding of various etiology treated with endovascular therapy. All the patients included in the study presented vaginal hemorrhage that was caused by: uterine leiomyomas, genital tract malignancies, ectopic pregnancy, arterio-venous mal-formations and other obstetrical causes. We excluded patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe hepatic impairment, congestive heart failure, renal failure or ventricular arrhythmias. (3) Results: Bleeding was caused in 88.19% of cases by uterine leiomyomas (n = 1001), 7.84% (n = 89) by cervical cancer, 2.29% by ectopic pregnancy (n = 26), 1.23% by arteriovenous malformation (n = 14) and 0.52% by major hemorrhage of obstetrical causes. Endovascular procedures were used in all the cases. In patients with uterine leiomyomas, supra-selective uterine arteries embolization was used. In 97% (n = 1101) of patients, bleeding was stopped after the first attempt of PAE. 3% (n = 34) needed a second embolization. In 12 of 14 cases of AVM, PAE was successful, two other cases needed reintervention; (4) Conclusions: Endovascular procedures represent a major therapy method for both acute and chronic hemorrhage in Obstetrics and Gynecology. It can be used in post-partum or post-traumatic causes of vaginal bleeding, but also in patients with chronic hemorrhage from uterine leiomyomas or inoperable genital malignancies or even as a preoperative adjuvant in cases of voluminous uterine fibroids or invasive malignant tumors, aiming to reduce intraoperative hemorrhage."

Documentation of coping and future goals was greater post-Ryan than pre-Ryan (57.8% vs. 26.8% for coping, 72.8% vs. 50.7% for goals; both p < 0.001). Coping was less likely to be documented for adolescents (aOR 0.02), patients of Asian race (aOR 0.08), those diagnosed in the emergency department (aOR 0.22), and those with ectopic or molar pregnancy (aOR 0.14) (all p < 0.005). Coping documentation increased with second-trimester loss (aOR 6.19) and outpatient follow-up (aOR 3.41) (all p < 0.005). Establishment of a Ryan Program was associated with greater attention to patient coping and goals after previable pregnancy loss. Patients experiencing medically-dangerous pregnancy losses receive less attention to their coping. Comprehensive family planning training and outpatient access may improve patient-centeredness of care for previable pregnancy loss."

    "abstract": "Although pediatric inguinal hernia (IH) is a very common disease, systematic reviews of herniated organs are scarce. The current study aims to clarify the contents of pediatric IH using preoperative ultrasonography (US) in association with patient age, sex, and risk for developing irreducible/strangulated hernia. The medical records of pediatric IH patients who underwent inguinal US examination prior to surgery between 2014 and 2019 were reviewed. Hernia contents were categorized into four groups based on US findings: bowel, omentum, ovary with or without fallopian tube, and ascites. A total of 524 IH lesions found in 220 men and 304 women were analyzed. The most common hernia content in patients under 12 months of age was the bowel (91.0%) in males and ovaries (89.5%) in females. The omentum became the most common herniated organ in both men (78.6%) and women (88.0%) aged 2 years and older. Emergency operations were performed in 3 patients (0.57%) due to irreducible IH, where 2 patients with irreducible ovaries, 5 and 7 months old, developed ovarian torsion and needed to undergo emergent salpingo-oophorectomy. The contents of pediatric IH depended on patient age and sex. Herniated ovaries in infants can twist in the hernia sac and become strangulated. It is important for clinicians to expect the herniated organ and take appropriate measures in the pediatric primary care setting."

    "abstract": "Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is one of the leading causes of maternal death. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to be highly sensitive for excluding ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy after a hysterectomy is a rare but life-threatening occurrence. We present a case where POCUS helped to diagnose a post-hysterectomy ectopic pregnancy. A 36-year-old female with a prior surgical history of hysterectomy without oophorectomy presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain. A POCUS revealed free fluid in the right upper quadrant with an unremarkable gallbladder. Subsequently, the pelvic POCUS noted free fluid as well as a heterogeneous structure in the right adnexa. The clinician ordered a serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin level, which was 173.2 international units per milliliter (lU/mL) (negative: < 5m IU/ml). Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a right adnexal echogenic structure with surrounding vascularity and moderate, complex free fluid suggestive of hemorrhage. Given the concern for possible ectopic pregnancy, obstetrics took the patient to the operating room where a right tubal ectopic pregnancy was confirmed. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid diagnosis. Ectopic pregnancy post hysterectomy is an uncommon occurrence infrequently considered in the differential diagnosis of lower abdominal pain, leading to considerable delays in diagnosis. Although uncommon, emergency clinicians must consider this diagnosis in female patients with lower abdominal pain."

To compare the incidence of endpoints marking delayed healthcare seeking in medical emergencies, before and during the pandemic. Based on a PICO model, medical emergency conditions that need timely intervention was selected to be evaluated as separate panels. In a systematic literature review, PubMed was quarried for each panel for studies comparing the incidence of various medical emergencies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Markers of failure/disruption of treatment due to delayed referral were included in the meta-analysis for each panel. There was a statistically significant increased pooled median time of symptom onset to admission of the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients; an increased rate of vasospasm of aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage; and perforation rate in acute appendicitis; diabetic ketoacidosis presentation rate among Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients; and rate of orchiectomy among testicular torsion patients in comparison of pre-COVID-19 with COVID-19 cohorts; while there were no significant changes in the event rate of ruptured ectopic pregnancy and median time of symptom onset to admission in the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) patients. COVID-19 has largely disrupted the referral of patients for emergency medical care and patient-related delayed care should be addressed as a major health threat."

    "abstract": "Frequencies of ultrasonographic findings and diagnoses in emergency departments in sub-Saharan Africa are unknown. This study aimed to describe the frequencies of different sonographic findings and diagnoses found in patients with abdominal symptoms or trauma presenting to a rural referral hospital in Tanzania. In this prospective observational study, we consecutively enrolled patients with abdominal symptoms or trauma triaged to the emergency room of the Saint Francis Referral Hospital, Ifakara. Patients with abdominal symptoms received an abdominal ultrasound. Patients with an abdominal or thoracic trauma received an Extended Focused Assessment with Ultrasound in Trauma (eFAST). From July 1st 2020 to June 30th 2021, a total of 88838 patients attended the emergency department, of which 7590 patients were triaged as 'very urgent' and were seen at the emergency room. A total of 1130 patients with abdominal symptoms received an ultrasound. The most frequent findings were abnormalities of the uterus or adnexa in 409/754 females (54.2%) and abdominal free fluid in 368 (32.6%) patients; no abnormality was found in 150 (13.5%) patients. A tumour in the abdomen or pelvis was found in 183 (16.2%) patients, an intrauterine pregnancy in 129/754 (17.1%) females, complete or incomplete abortion in 96 (12.7%), and a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in 32 (4.2%) females. In males, most common diagnosis was intestinal obstruction in 54/376 (14.4%), and splenomegaly in 42 (11.2%). Of 1556 trauma patients, 283 (18.1%) received an eFAST, and 53 (18.7%) had positive findings. A total of 27 (9.4%) trauma patients and 51 (4.5%) non-trauma patients were sent directly to the operating theatre. In this study, ultrasound examination revealed abnormal findings for the majority of patients with non-traumatic abdominal symptoms. Building up capacity to provide diagnostic ultrasound is a promising strategy to improve emergency services, especially in a setting where diagnostic modalities are limited."

Secondary analyses identified diagnosis codes associated with a primary diagnosis of AT. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Emergency Sample database. Women aged 18 to 65 years presenting to the ED with AT from 2006 to 2018. Not applicable. From 2006 to 2018, the annual number of ED visits for AT among women aged 18 to 65 years increased from 2791 to 5243. Hospital admission rates for AT declined over the study period from 76% to 37%. Patients with AT were less likely to be admitted if they had private insurance, but admission rates for AT were similar regardless of income quartile and hospital teaching status. Average ED charges for AT nearly quadrupled over the study period compared with ED charges overall, which doubled. The average charge for AT patients in 2006 was $5212 and in 2018 was $20 213-an average annual increase of 24.0%, compared with 14.3% for all other diagnoses in age-matched women. Although admission rates for AT decreased by 50% from 2006 to 2018, ED utilization nearly doubled, and the average associated charges quadrupled, summing to an annual weighted charge of over $500 million by 2018. The data suggest that women are evaluated similarly for AT regardless of income or insurance status."

    "title": "Pediatric Ovarian Torsion: Should You Go With the Flow?",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) is an emergency that mandates early detection and surgical detorsion to avoid catastrophic consequences of further adnexal injury. Prompt ultrasound is critical for accurate diagnosis. Traditionally, evaluation of arterial and venous flow was used as a diagnostic tool for OT, but recent radiologic research has indicated that ovarian size and size discrepancy between sides is a better diagnostic criterion. This study seeks to determine whether ovarian size discrepancy or vascular flow to the ovary is more accurate in the diagnosis of OT in the pediatric emergency population and to better describe symptoms that distinguish OT from other abdominal and pelvic pathology. This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study evaluating all female pediatric patients, aged 1 to 18 years, who underwent a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for OT over a 2-year period in our pediatric emergency department. Patients suitable for inclusion were identified via Nuance mPowerTM, a search engine that provides clinical analytics based on radiology reports generated within our institution. We reviewed the medical records of 193 female patients aged 1 to 18 years, all of whom had a pelvic ultrasound (with or without Doppler) to evaluate for OT during the study period. In comparing ovarian size on ultrasound, patients with OT had a significantly larger magnitude of difference in ovarian volume than patients without torsion (5.57× [interquartile range, 3-12.5] vs 1.56× [interquartile range, 1.24-2.25; P < 0.001]). Ovarian torsion was associated with a 33-fold increased risk of lack of arterial flow (relative risk, 33.33) and with a 9-fold increased risk of lack of venous flow (relative risk, 9.27), when compared with those patients without OT. Patients with OT were significantly more likely to have emesis and peritoneal signs on examination, as well as previous history of OT (P = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.002, respectively) than those without OT. All patients with OT reported abdominal pain. We found that a large size discrepancy between ovaries is indicative of OT. Our data also suggest that presence of Doppler flow on ultrasound cannot be used to exclude OT but that lack of Doppler flow on ultrasound is a significant diagnostic marker. As previous studies have also found, clinical symptoms of OT are nonspecific and do not offer any certainty in differentiating OT from other pathologies."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies are a dreaded and common cause of first-trimester metrorrhagia. They refer to the implantation and development of the embryo outside the uterine cavity. Interstitial localization is uncommon and corresponds to implantation of the embryo in the intramural part of the uterine tube. It has an unforeseen evolution with a risk of cataclysmic hemorrhage by uterine rupture in the absence of early diagnosis and management. We herein present the uncommon case of a 26-year-old female patient, second gestation, nulliparous, who underwent a pelvic ultrasonography in the emergency department for pelvic pain associated with a two-month amenorrhea. A past history of left salpingectomy for a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy 3 years ago was found. Pelvic ultrasound allowed us to detect a ruptured ectopic interstitial pregnancy at 7 weeks of amenorrhea. Significant hemoperitoneum and hemodynamic instability required emergency laparotomy. The condition was confirmed preoperatively and the patient underwent a corneal resection. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 4 postoperatively. The interstitial ectopic pregnancy is an uncommon and life-threatening condition. The importance of early ultrasound detection is of paramount importance to allow conservative treatment with methotrexate injections. Delayed diagnosis requires cornual uterine resection with all the complications that it implies."

    "abstract": "Multivariate logistic analysis was employed to explore the risk factors of safety risks in the transport of critically ill patients with ICU and the improvement of nursing strategies. Two hundred critical transport patients with ICU treated in our hospital from January 2019 to April 2021 were enrolled. According to the occurrence of unsafe events in transit, the patients were assigned to the control group (165 cases without unsafe events, n = 165) and the study group (35 cases with safety incidents, n = 35). Multivariate logistic analysis was employed to explore the risk factors of safety risks in the transport of critically ill patients with ICU and to enhance nursing strategies. (1) General data of the subjects: among the 200 critically ill patients with ICU who needed in-hospital transport, the age ranged from 18 to 85 years with an average age of 52.48 ± 3.31, including 89 males and 111 females. There were 35 cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, 16 cases of respiratory failure, 23 cases of heart failure, 43 cases of myocardial infarction, 26 cases of cerebrovascular accident, 14 cases of ectopic pregnancy, 25 cases of severe injury, and 18 cases of mechanical ventilation. There were 35 cases in the study group with accidents and 45 cases in group B without accidents. (2) Among the 200 patients, 35 patients had complications during the transit process in the intermediate people's court, with an incidence rate of 17.5%. It included blood pressure fluctuation (n = 6), artificial airway obstruction (n = 6), decrease in blood oxygen saturation (n = 10), dyspnea (n = 5), fall pain (n = 3), elevated intracranial pressure (n = 2), and other factors (n = 3). There exhibited no significant difference in blood oxygen saturation at each time point during transport (P > 0.05). There exhibited no significant difference in SpO2 before transport. The comparison of 5 min and 10 min blood oxygen saturation during transit in the study group was lower compared to the control group (P < 0.05). (3) In a univariate analysis of safety risks for critically ill ICU patients, home escorts did not show significant differences in hospital transport for critically ill ICU patients (P > 0.05). There were significant differences in terms of age, patient's condition, transport escort, auxiliary ventilation, means of transport, uncarried drugs and goods, and carrying pipeline (P < 0.05). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, patient's condition, transport escort, auxiliary ventilation, means of transport, uncarried drugs and goods, and carrying pipeline were the risk factors affecting the safe transport of critically ill patients (P < 0.05). Age, patient's condition, transport escort, auxiliary ventilation, means of transport, uncarried drugs and goods, and carrying pipeline are the independent risk factors that affect the safe transport of emergency or ICU critically ill patients. Therefore, in order to reduce the risk of transshipment, we must enhance the safety awareness of escorts, strengthen the management and training of escorts, promote rules and regulations, and formulate dangerous plans, so as to eliminate the occurrence of unsafe factors."

    "abstract": "Background: Extratubal secondary trophoblastic implants following laparoscopic salpingectomy is an extremely rare form of persistent ectopic pregnancy. These cases usually result in a small amount of vaginal bleeding and sudden lower abdominal pain thereby presenting with hemoperitoneum in emergencies. Owing to the urgency of hemoperitoneum and the uncertainty of the location of persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic salpingectomy, the risk of reoperation is increased. It is necessary to prevent in first surgery and diagnose these cases in the early following up phase.Methods: We report a case of 26-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 0, presenting a little vaginal bleeding and slight lower abdominal pain after laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy for more than 1 month. The patient's serum β-HCG was still high (3981 mIU/ml), and no abnormalities were found through auxiliary examination (ultrasound, abdominal CT, and pelvic MRI).Results: Finally, emergency laparoscopy revealed many blue purple nodules on the surface of ovaries, small intestine, omentum, and periumbilical peritoneum, with a diameter of 3-20 mm. The lesions were completely removed as far as possible. Pathology showed trophoblastic proliferation and β-HCG soon decreased to negative after this operation.Conclusion: Therefore, it is important to follow up serum β-HCG even after salpingectomy and avoid iatrogenic dissemination of trophoblast tissue through careful operation."

This retrospective cohort study used electronic medical record data from the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (2014-2019) for patients who requested medication abortion with a last menstrual period (LMP) of 42 days or less and pregnancy of unknown location (no gestational sac) on initial ultrasonogram. Clinicians could initiate medication abortion with mifepristone followed by misoprostol while simultaneously excluding ectopic pregnancy with serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) testing (same-day-start group) or establish a diagnosis with serial hCG tests and repeat ultrasonogram before initiating treatment (delay-for-diagnosis group). We compared primary safety outcomes (time to diagnosis of pregnancy location [rule out ectopic], emergency department visits, adverse events, and nonadherence with follow-up) between groups. We also reported secondary efficacy outcomes: time to complete abortion, successful medication abortion (no uterine aspiration), and ongoing pregnancy. Of 5,619 medication abortion visits for patients with an LMP of 42 days or less, 452 patients had pregnancy of unknown location (8.0%). Three patients underwent immediate uterine aspiration, 55 had same-day start, and 394 had delay for diagnosis. Thirty-one patients (7.9%), all in the delay-for-diagnosis group, were treated for ectopic pregnancy, including four that were ruptured. Among patients with no major ectopic pregnancy risk factors (n=432), same-day start had shorter time to diagnosis (median 5.0 days vs 9.0 days; P=.005), with no significant difference in emergency department visits (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.43-1.88) or nonadherence with follow-up (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.39-2.15). Among patients who proceeded with abortion (n=270), same-day start had shorter time to complete abortion (median 5.0 days vs 19.0 days; P<.001). Of those who had medication abortion with known outcome (n=170), the rate of successful medication abortion was lower (85.4% vs 96.7%; P=.013) and the rate of ongoing pregnancy was higher (10.4% vs 2.5%; P=.041) among patients in the same-day-start group. In patients with undesired pregnancy of unknown location, immediate initiation of medication abortion is associated with more rapid exclusion of ectopic pregnancy and pregnancy termination but lower abortion efficacy."

Of those who went to the operating room (OR) (n = 113), AT was found in 57%. There was no difference between patients taken to the OR with or without AT regarding demographics or presentation. The presence of nausea/vomiting, tenderness, leukocytosis, lack of blood flow, or a mass/cyst >5 cm were found to be more likely in patients with AT than in those without. An ovarian volume ratio >15 was noted to be predictive of AT. Six patients initially discharged from the emergency department returned and went to the OR, two of which had AT, both with ovarian salvage. Limited data are available when counseling patients with presumed AT. We found the larger mean ovarian volume and an ovarian volume ratio >15 were predictive of AT. Despite this, 43% of patients taken to the OR did not have AT. This relatively high rate of not finding AT intraoperatively may be justified given the sequelae of missing AT."

This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary hospital. Medical records for all admissions for AT between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2020 were reviewed and data regarding patient demographics, history of torsion, and the index admission were collected. Conservative surgery was defined as detorsion only or detorsion with cyst decompression. Interventional surgery was defined as ovarian cystectomy, salpingectomy, oophorectomy or salpingo-oopherectomy. 126 women were included for final analysis. Of the 109 women diagnosed with AT at emergency surgery, 12 were postmenopausal (all had interventional surgery). In the 97 premenopausal women, 50 (52%) underwent conservative surgery. Pregnant women were more likely to undergo conservative surgery than non-pregnant women (Relative Risk [RR] 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5, 0.75, p = 0.001). Women having laparoscopies were also more likely to undergo conservative surgery (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01, 0.53, p = 0.001) than if they had laparotomies. Although not reaching statistical significance, women were more likely to undergo laparotomy if they were febrile or if a senior gynecology consultant was involved in their care. History of torsion, age, parity and ovarian size did not alter the risk of interventional surgery. This study identified that premenopausal women who presented emergently with AT were significantly more likely to have conservative surgery if they were pregnant or if they underwent laparoscopic surgery."

This is an obstetric case diagnosed preoperatively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report the case of a 19-years-old primigravida patient with rupture of rudimentary horn in 26th gestational week. The patient presented with sudden onset severe abdominal pain in the emergency room. Intraabdominal free fluid is detected. To evaluate the etiology of free fluid and location of the gestational sac, an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was planned. The decision of emergent laparotomy is made because of sonographic detection of abdominal excessive -concentrated- free fluid, abdominal tenderness, and 2 points decrease of hemoglobin value in the control hemogram. A rudimentary horn pregnancy and fundal rupture of the rudimentary part of the uterus are diagnosed during the surgical procedure. A baby -live- weighing 450 g was delivered. The ruptured rudimentary horn and same-sided tuba uterina were surgically removed. Rudimentary horn pregnancy is a rare ectopic pregnancy. Diagnosis is difficult clinically, even with diagnostic imaging modalities. Identifying both cornuas systematically in all patients increases the detection rate. The absence of continuity between the gestational sac's lumen and the cervical canal on imaging is an important finding. Due to the serious maternal and fetal complications, its detection at an early week may be life-saving."

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of ovarian torsion, including presentation, evaluation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. Ovarian torsion is one of the most common gynecological surgical emergencies and occurs with complete or partial rotation of the ovary along the supporting ligaments, obstructing vascular flow. Several risk factors include the presence of an ovarian mass or cyst. The most common population affected includes reproductive aged women, though cases also occur in premenarchal females, pregnant women, and postmenopausal women. Abdominal or pelvic pain is common but is not always sudden in onset or severe. Nausea and vomiting occur in 70%. Ultrasound can assist with diagnosis, but a normal ultrasound examination cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast can assist with diagnosis. Treatment includes emergent gynecologic consultation for surgical detorsion, along with symptomatic therapy in the ED. An understanding of ovarian torsion can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease."

Hysteroscopic sterilization reversal carries a potential risk of interstitial ectopic pregnancy; therefore, it is important to counsel patients appropriate and review the alternative option for in vitro fertilization. In vitro fertilization has been shown to have a superior pregnancy and live birth rate in comparison to sterilization reversal. Women who have undergone sterilization via hysteroscopic placement of the Essure device may complete in vitro fertilization with sterilization devices left in situ without significantly reducing the pregnancy rate. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old woman, G6P3023, presented to the Emergency Department after incidental detection of left interstitial ectopic pregnancy measuring 9 weeks of gestation. She had previously undergone a right salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy soon after reversal of Essure sterilization via bilateral tubouterine reimplantation; this is a procedure that is infrequently performed due to limited evidence to suggest that this is a safe and efficacious method to achieve future pregnancies. This patient underwent an uncomplicated left cornuostomy and salpingectomy, rendering the need for in vitro fertilization to conceive in the future. CONCLUSIONS Patients seeking fertility treatment after hysteroscopic sterilization should be counseled that tubouterine reimplantation poses significant morbidity risk based on the nature of the surgery. Instead, patients who have undergone hysteroscopic sterilization who desire future pregnancy should be advised that in vitro fertilization, with or without salpingectomy, may be a safer and more efficacious option to achieve live birth."

    "abstract": "A 24-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with symptoms consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasonographic evaluation reported no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, a heterogenous mass in the left adnexa, and normal-appearing bilateral ovaries. The right kidney was imaged, though the left kidney was not visualized. Beta-HCG was reported below the discriminatory zone. Two days later, her ultrasound remained unchanged, and beta-HCG had not risen appropriately. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a dilated right fallopian tube with products of conception exuding from the fimbriated end. Laparoscopically, the patient's pelvic anatomy was found to be abnormal. There was no left fallopian tube and the uterus appeared unicornuate with absent left horn. A left streak ovary was present superior to the pelvic brim in the pericolic gutter, though the right ovary appeared normal and in the appropriate position. At follow-up, hysterosalpingography showed a right-sided unicornuate uterus without septation, a small tubular endometrial cavity, and a patent right fallopian tube. Defects of unification of the Mullerian ducts, such as unicornuate uterus, do not reduce the ability to achieve pregnancy, but do increase the risk of adverse outcomes and fetal malpresentation."

    "abstract": "To describe a surgical technique of laparoscopic resection of a cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) with an immediate myometrial reconstruction. The advantage of such a technique is that it is a minimally-invasive procedure that can treat the ectopic pregnancy and the defected scar at the same time with good postoperative results. Video article with the description of a surgical minimally-invasive technique. Academic medical center. A 34-year-old patient, Gravida 6 Para 4 Abortus 1, with a history of 4 previous cesarean sections presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient was hemodynamically stable. An endovaginal ultrasound revealed a viable pregnancy of 8 weeks implanted in the cesarean scar, with a residual myometrium of <1 mm. Because of increasing abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and a desire to preserve future fertility, an emergent laparoscopy was performed. Laparoscopy was performed using a CO2 AcuPulse laser device (Lumenis Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah). A continuous wave mode was used, with a power of 30 Watt and a round-shaped beam of 1.5 mm in diameter. The laser was connected to a 10-mm Hopkins endoscope 0° (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). A complete adhesiolysis was performed, and the urinary bladder was detached from the anterior abdominal wall. The vesicouterine fold was opened to expose the isthmic part of the uterus where the ectopic pregnancy was implanted. The defected scar was resected en bloc with the pregnancy, using the laser. The limits of the resection depended on the residual myometrial thickness. We considered a myometrial thickness of >8 mm as healthy tissue. A metallic probe was introduced vaginally into the endocervix to differentiate the anterior part from the posterior part of the uterus. This probe facilitates the manipulation of the cervix and, thus, the laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing during the myometrial reconstruction. A 2-layered suturing was performed. The first layer of the suture consisted of 3 interrupted figure-of-8 sutures using a monofilament absorbable suture (Monocryl 0, ETHICON-Johnson and Johnson medical devices New Brunswick, New Jersey). A second superficial layer consisted of a continuous nonlocking suture using the same type of thread. Laparoscopic excision of the CSP and immediate repair of the scar defect without any postoperative complications. An emergent laparoscopy was performed, with excision of the CSP and immediate reconstruction of the residual myometrium. No complications occurred, the blood loss was estimated at 200 mL, and no blood transfusion was necessary. The patient was discharged 24 hours after the intervention. Six months after surgery, the remaining myometrial thickness was between 7 mm and 9.3 mm, and no residual cesarean scar defect (isthmocele) was visualized by ultrasound. Cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy. The incidence, however, is increasing as a consequence of the rising cesarean section rate. Different surgical and nonsurgical techniques have been described in the literature. Laparoscopic excision of a CSP is an effective and feasible technique with the advantage of an immediate myometrial reconstruction. The cesarean scar defect diminishes, and this potentially could improve the future fertility of the patient and decrease the probability of abnormal uterine bleeding and chronic pelvic pain."

In the current study, a case of term delivery of a heterotopic pregnancy coexisting with ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy, diagnosed by ultrasound (US) and clinical examination findings, which was managed successfully. A 25 year old Nigerian female, gravida 4, para 2 (2 term gestation, 1 spontaneous abortion) presented at the Emergency room with acute abdominal pain associated with vomiting. She had 8 weeks amenorrhea and a positive pregnancy test three weeks prior to presentation. Transvaginal ultrasound scan revealed a six-weeks viable intrauterine gestation. A diagnosis of possible ectopic pregnancy was made. Further trans-abdominal ultrasonography imaging revealed viable intrauterine pregnancy with evidence of an echogenic mass measuring 6.5 x 7.5cm in the abdominal cavity with significant fluid collection, and both ovaries were visualized and separate from the mass. An emergency exploratory laparotomy with right salpingectomy was performed with minimal handling of the uterus and other pelvic structures. At 37 weeks and 5 days gestation, she had an elective C/S for a transverse lying fetus and delivered a live normal birth weight baby girl with a good Apgar score."

    "abstract": "Pelvic pain (PP) is common in pregnant women and can be caused by several diseases, including obstetrics, gynaecological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and vascular disorders. Timely and accurate diagnosis as well as prompt treatment are crucial for the well-being of the mother and foetus. However, these are very challenging. It should be considered that the physiological changes occurring during pregnancy may confuse the diagnosis. In this setting, ultrasound (US) represents the first-line imaging technique since it is readily and widely available and does not use ionizing radiations. In some cases, US may be conclusive for the diagnosis (e.g., if it detects no foetal cardiac activity in suspected spontaneous abortion; if it shows an extrauterine gestational sac in suspected ectopic pregnancy; or if it reveals a dilated, aperistaltic, and blind-ending tubular structure arising from the cecum in suspicious of acute appendicitis). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), overcoming some limits of US, represents the second-line imaging technique when an US is negative or inconclusive, to detect the cause of bowel obstruction, or to characterize adnexal masses."

    "abstract": "The incidence of ectopic pregnancies has steadily increased over recent years and despite advances in treatment it still remains a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. The objective of this audit was to assess whether diagnosis and management is occurring as per international suggested guidance and practice. This study is a retrospective one using data collected from June 2019 to June 2020. All data were password protected and kept anonymous. No patient contact occurred. The standard cross referenced was the 'April 2019 NICE Guideline on the Management of Ectopic Pregnancy'. Thirty-one ectopic pregnancies occurred between June 2019 and June 2020. Twenty-nine underwent surgical management and two medical. Six out of the 29 surgically managed patients were managed incorrectly. Twenty-four of the surgical cases were managed laparoscopically. Presence of a foetal heart rate remained undocumented in 21 out of 31 of cases. The results highlight the ease of access to emergency gynaecological services at Malta's national hospital. However, this audit did highlight the discrepancy that can occur in examination in association with ectopic pregnancy. An inconsistency was noted in documentation. Additionally, a number of cases could have been offered and benefitted from different modes of management.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in mothers of childbearing age. The diagnostic method and appropriate management for EP has been extensively studied. Concrete- and evidence-based guidelines guide clinical management and improve morbidity and mortality. Local guidelines improve clinical outcome.What do the results of this study add? This study shows the impact of clinical outcome without a national guideline to guide management on a national level. Malta has one national hospital in which the local obstetrics and gynaecology department is run. The results of this study thus comprise of nationwide statistics on EP and its management. Ectopic pregnancies are managed without a local guideline in place. It also reflects the ease of access to health care in smaller countries.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The findings of this study have resulted in the production of a local guideline for the management of EP, as well as the introduction of a protocol for obtaining methotrexate for medical management. It has introduced new ultrasound machines and staff training to aid diagnostics. Further re-auditing will be carried out to analyse the impact a local guideline has on clinical practice at a national level."

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a global emergency. In Zambia only 55% of tuberculosis cases are diagnosed. We performed a study to determine incidental cases of tuberculosis seen at forensic autopsy of individuals who died suddenly and unexpectedly in the community in Lusaka, Zambia. Whole-body autopsies were performed according to Standard Operating Procedures. Representative samples obtained from relevant organs were subjected to pathological examination. Information on circumstances surrounding the death was obtained. Data on patient demographics, gross and microscopic pathological findings, and cause(s) of death were analysed. Incidental tuberculosis was found in 52 cases (45 male, 7 female, age range 14-66) out of 4286 whole-body autopsies. 41/52 (80%) were aged 21-50 years. One was a 14-year old boy who died during a football match. 39/52 (75%) deaths were attributable specifically to tuberculosis only. Other deaths were due to acute alcohol intoxication(4), violence(7), ruptured ectopic pregnancy(1), bacterial meningitis (1). All the cases were from poor socio-economic backgrounds and lived in high-density areas of Lusaka. Incidental cases of active tuberculosis undiagnosed antemortem seen at forensic autopsy reflects major gaps in the national TB control programs. More investments into proactive screening, testing, treatment activities, and accurate data collection are required."

It can occur after natural conception, however, it is more common with assisted reproductive techniques , when over one embryo is transferred. Quadruplet heterotopic pregnancy is an exceedingly rare subset. Our case describes a woman who presented to the emergency room with amenorrhea for 9 weeks and lower abdominal pain for 3 days. Transvaginal ultrasound revealed three alive intrauterine fetuses and one left tubal ectopic pregnancy (Quadruplet heterotopic pregnancy). Patient benefited from emergent laparotomy with favorable outcome both in the short term and in the long term. In a patient with a history of assisted reproductive techniques, a high index of suspicion is warranted towards extra-uterine pregnancy. Sonologists should precisely look for adnexal mass. The presence of peritoneal free-fluid requires further investigation. The prognosis of intrauterine fetuses is good, provided the ectopic pregnancy is managed timely and in an effective manner."

Oxidative stress and inflammation play central roles in the development of ischemia/reperfusion injuries. We investigated the effects of Vitamin B12, thought to possess antioxidant characteristics on oxidative stress and the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)/nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in the ovaries during ischemia-reperfusion. Forty-eight rats were randomly assigned into six groups and the groups are designed as follows: Control (C), Ischemia (I), Ischemia + Vitamin B12 (I + B12), Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R), I/R + Vitamin B12 (I/R + B12) and Sham + Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 was administered at a dose of 400 mcg/kg via the i.p. route once daily for three days before I/R procedure. Tissue interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in ovarian tissue increased following I/R, while glutathione (GSH) levels decreased. Moreover, extensive congestion, edema, hemorrhage and defective follicle were observed. Both NF-κB and TLR-4 expression levels also increased in the group exposed to I/R. While GSH levels increased, IL-1β, IL-6, MDA, NF-κB and TLR-4 levels decreased with Vitamin B12 treatment. In addition, ovarian tissue without edema, mild congestion, and normal-appearing follicles were observed following Vitamin B12 administration. The findings showed that I/R in ovarian tissue resulted in significant tissue damage by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation. However, Vitamin B12 application was effective and alternative agent in reducing injury deriving from inflammation and oxidative stress developing in association with I/R in ovarian tissue."

    "abstract": "A cornual pregnancy describes a rare ectopic location positioned within the myometrium next to the fallopian tube, which can be difficult to find on traditional ultrasound imaging. Given its location and the stretch within the uterine wall, cornual pregnancies can progress for weeks prior to diagnosis. Ruptures can, therefore, be catastrophic with disproportionally high maternal mortality rates compared to other ectopic pregnancies. A 34-year-old female recently treated with methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy presented to the emergency department (ED) for acute onset of lower abdominal cramping without vaginal bleeding. She arrived clinically stable and quickly decompensated with witnessed syncope in the ED, prompting point-of-care ultrasound showing free fluid in the abdomen. The patient was taken for emergent surgery by obstetrics while receiving transfusion of blood products for suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy. A fetus estimated to be 10 weeks of age was discovered in the left cornual region. Approximately two liters of intraperitoneal blood were drained without complication. Cornual pregnancy is a difficult to diagnose but potentially disastrous type of ectopic pregnancy due to massive hemorrhage. Emergency clinicians should be aware of this condition given its rare occurrence but potentially catastrophic outcomes."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is the fifth common gynecological emergency that can affect females of all ages particularly during reproductive age and its management by detorsion leads to ovarian ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. Therefore, prophylactic measures are required to protect the ovarian function after detorsion. So that, our study aimed to assess the effect and underlying mechanisms of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inducer; hemin against ovarian damage induced by IR injury in rats. Female rats were divided into: sham group, hemin group, ovarian IR (OIR) groups with and without hemin treatment. Serum levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and interleukin 1 β (IL-1β) were measured in addition to ovarian levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Ovarian phospho-Janus kinase (p-JNK) levels and gene expressions of HO-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were determined. Moreover, histopathological changes and expressions of phospho-nuclear factor kappa B p65 (p-NF-κB p65) and cleaved caspase-3 were done. Treatment of OIR rats with hemin led to significant attenuation of ovarian damage through histological examination which was associated with significant increase in ovarian expression of HO-1, ovarian SOD and serum GSH levels with significant decrease in ovarian p-JNK levels, expressions of p-NF-κB p65, iNOS and cleaved caspase-3 in addition to serum IL-1β levels. The protective effect of hemin can be attributed to the increased expression of HO-1 which showed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Therefore, hemin can be administered to prevent ovarian IR injury which occurs after detorsion."

    "abstract": "Cervical ectopic pregnancy (CEP) is characterised by the implantation of trophoblastic tissue within the cervical canal and is associated with a significant risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. This case report addresses a second-trimester CEP with unusual sonographic features suspicious of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), which was successfully managed with an abdominal hysterectomy. A 27-year-old woman, G6P2, presented to the labour ward of a rural hospital at 18 weeks of gestation with premature rupture of membranes. The index pregnancy was complicated by an absence of any antenatal care, as well as a history of cigarette smoking and cannabis use. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a live pregnancy with the foetal head within the cervical canal. A termination of pregnancy was arranged with misoprostol 200 mg orally followed by an oxytocin induction. However, a repeat ultrasound scan, after 12 h of oxytocin infusion, which failed to terminate the pregnancy, demonstrated a still live foetus as well as increased vascularity, concerning for PAS. The patient underwent an emergency abdominal hysterectomy, with an intraoperative diagnosis of a CEP. The postoperative course was unremarkable, and the patient was discharged home on day 3 post-operatively. Appropriate antenatal care and early booking-in would have identified a CEP early in gestation and allowed for minimally invasive management and potential conservation of fertility. When this is not possible in such cases, meticulous pre-operative planning by a gynaecologist with experience in advanced pelvic surgery can minimise the associated morbidity and mortality."

A total of 35 Wistar albino female rats were randomly separated into five groups, n = 7 per group: Group 1: Sham (S) was only given a laparotomy procedure. Group 2: Ischaemia (I) group with 2-hour ischaemia using a vascular sutur. Group 3: Ischaemia/Reperfusion (I/R) group with 2 hour ischaemia and 2-hour reperfusion.

Two daily doses of TMZ were orally administered to Group 4 (S + TMZ) and Group 5 (I/R + TMZ) for three days. TMZ significantly decreased vascular congestion, haemorrhage, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration in group 5 compared to group 3 (p < .05). Despite TMZ decreased the malondialdehyde, total oxidant status, and oxidative stress index values, these decreases were not statistically significant (p > .05). TMZ which is an antioxidant agent can efficiently prevent in I/R damage in rat ovaries but further studies are necessary in order to implement it in the clinical settings.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Adnexial torsion is the most common gynecological emergency and there are no specific clinical, laboratories, or radiological findings for adnexal torsion. Unfortunatelly, the currently accepted treatment is adnexal detorsion. Cytoprotective effects of Trimetazidine (TMZ), an antianginal drug, are well-defined and it has been demonstrated to improve oxidative stress markers and limits membrane damage induced by reactive oxygen species and protects tissues from free radicals with its antioxidant effects. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of TMZ in experimentally induced adnexal torsion in rats and to investigate possible effects in maintaining ovarian reserve to prevent I/R damage or reperfusion damage.What do the results of this study add? Our study showed that TMZ significantly decreased vascular congestion, haemorrhage, and PMNL infiltration. TMZ decreased the malondialdehyde, total oxidant status, and the oxidative stress index values, but these decreases were not statistically significant.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Although various antioxidant drugs and chemicals have been used to protect the ovaries against I/R damage, they have not been demostrated to prevent it completely. TMZ, an antioxidant efficacy agent, has been shown to prevent ovarian I/R damage by suppressing inflammation in terms of histopathological parameters. Further studies involving a greater number of experimental animals are required before using TMZ for the treatment of humans with I/R damage in the clinical setting."

We also aimed to investigate whether kisspeptin can be used for differential diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage from early pregnancy. This was a prospective case-control study that was conducted at a tertiary centre of obstetrics and gynaecology. Four groups of women (81 patients) enrolled in the study: group 1, women with ectopic pregnancy (n = 17); group 2, women with miscarriage (n = 23); group 3, women with healthy pregnancy at first trimester (n = 21); and group 4, healthy non-pregnant women (n = 18). Serum kisspeptin levels were found as 0.30 (0.22-0.40), 0.11 (0.08-0.16), 1.48 (1.29-1.80), and 0.03 (0.01-0.04) ng/mL in ectopic, miscarriage, healthy pregnancy and non-pregnant groups, respectively (p< .001). A moderate correlation was seen between serum kisspeptin levels and human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) (r= 0.51, p< .001). Our data showed that for the first time that a single serum kisspeptin level may be used to discriminate ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage from healthy pregnancy at early weeks' gestation. In addition, serum kisspeptin levels of the patients with ectopic pregnancy were found higher significantly than the patients with miscarriage.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Definite diagnosis of abnormal or abnormal pregnancies at first trimester is based on hCG levels and ultrasonography. Kisspeptin, a neuropeptide was investigated in normal pregnancies and found to be increased in trophoblastic invasion.What do the results of this study add? Serum kisspeptin levels in patients with normal pregnancy were found more higher than patients with ectopic or miscarriage at early weeks of gestation (p < .001). The women with ectopic pregnancy have higher kisspeptin levels than the women with miscarriage (p < .001).What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is rare in the pediatric population. Delayed diagnosis can significantly impact fertility. The aim of this review is to highlight current knowledge regarding clinical presentation, diagnosis, surgical management, and follow-up in the pediatric population. Whilst the presentation is often very unspecific, most children will present with sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain associated with vomiting. A key diagnostic test is pelvic ultrasonography, which may help demonstrate an asymmetric enlarged ovary with peripherally displaced follicles. In the pediatric population, ovarian torsion may occur in a normal ovary. However, underlying lesions can be found in half of cases. Benign neoplasms (teratomas or cystic lesions) represent the commonest etiology, with the risk of malignancy being less than 2%. Surgical management should be focused on fertility preservation. This is achievable through ovarian detorsion ± ovarian cystectomy ± oophoropexy to avoid recurrence. Follow-up studies demonstrate excellent recovery rates of detorsed ovaries including those with ischemic appearances. What is Known: • Ovarian torsion is a rare diagnosis in the pediatric population. • Aspecific symptoms and differential diagnoses lead to missed or delayed diagnosis increasing the risk of oophoprectomy and further infertility. What is New: • Reviewing the latest knowledge about clinical presentation, diagnostic, surgical management, and follow-up of ovarian torsion in the pediatric population. • Adiponectin was negatively associated with diastolic blood pressure and HOMA-IR, and chemerin was negatively associated with glucose."

Technical and clinical success rates of UAE were analyzed. Of the 48 patients, 11 patients were in the massive bleeding group and 37 were in the minor bleeding group. Five patients were referred for UAE in each group and UAE was a priority for patients with unstable hemodynamics (chi-square value = 5.524, P =.022). Conservative management, dilation and curettage (D&C), operative hysteroscopy, and UAE were performed in 16 (33%), 18 (38%), 7 (15%), and 13 (27%) patients, respectively. Two patients with ectopic pregnancies suffered uncontrollable bleeding during D&C and required emergent UAE. Three patients underwent UAE before surgery to prevent hemorrhage. The technical and clinical success rates of UAE were 100%. No complications or recurrences occurred. UAE is a safe and effective treatment for UAVM-RPOC and a priority for patients with unstable hemodynamics. Conservative management, D&C, and hysteroscopy are safe and effective for patients with UAVM-RPOC with stable hemodynamics. However, UAVM-RPOC following ectopic pregnancy may have high risks of massive hemorrhage during procedures."

    "abstract": "Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraception (EC) inhibits ovulation to prevent fertilization. Misconceptions regarding its mechanism of action contribute to low use in some settings. We aimed to review the mechanism of action of Levonorgestrel EC and assess the evidence for a postovulatory effect on viable pregnancy development in the exposed and subsequent cycles. We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, the Cochrane database, and the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. We included studies reporting on the effect of Levonorgestrel EC exposure on (1) ovulation, (2) conception, (3) implantation, (4) ectopic pregnancy, (5) pregnancy viability, and (6) fertility in subsequent cycles. Data were extracted and tabulated from included studies by two researchers. The results were analyzed and summarized in narrative form. We included 33 studies. Women exposed to Levonorgestrel EC at or after the LH (luteinizing hormone) surge had similar rates of inhibited ovulation (3 studies) and conception rates (2 studies) as controls. Nine out of ten studies found no difference in endometrial receptivity to implantation after exposure to Levonorgestrel EC compared to controls. The evidence for an association between Levonorgestrel EC and reduced fallopian tube motility or ectopic pregnancy was conflicting. We found no evidence of increased miscarriage or teratogenicity (3 studies) or disrupted menstrual cycle (3 studies) after Levonorgestrel EC exposure compared to controls. This review supports that Levonorgestrel EC taken after ovulation does not affect implantation and results in similar conception rates compared to placebo. There is no evidence that exposure to Levonorgestrel EC affects fetal development, miscarriage, stillbirth, or subsequent menstruations."

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and surgical outcomes of the vNOTES method and compare it with conventional laparoscopy (CL) in gynecological emergency cases. A retrospective study was conducted to compare vNOTES with CL regarding pre-/intra-/postoperative outcomes. The women who were operated on for emergency indications such as ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, ovarian cyst rupture and acute abdominal pain were evaluated. Patients' age, gravidity, parity, medical/surgical history, height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, pre-/postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, the quantity of aspirated hemoperitoneum, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores six and 12 h postoperatively, duration of surgery and hospital stay were recorded. The study was conducted with 90 women. Sixty of them underwent CL, while 30 women had vNOTES. The vNOTES group had a significantly shorter duration of surgery -28.5 min (15-48 min) vs. 77 min (29-155 min), respectively, p < .001), shorter hospital stay - 32 h (11-125 h) vs. 38 h (12-201 h), respectively, p = .007), lower VAS scores after 6 h - 5 (4-7) vs. 6 (2-8), respectively, p < .001), and after 12 h - 2 (1-3) vs. 2 (1-5), respectively, p < .001) and a lower dose of postoperative analgesic administration - 2 (2-3) vs. 3 (1-5), respectively, p < .001) than the CL group. vNOTES surgeries can be considered an alternative technique to CL by providing shorter surgery duration, lower postoperative pain scores, shorter hospital stays and better cosmetic outcomes."

    "abstract": "Colon cancer has a high incidence of metastasis, with an estimated 0.8-7.4% of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC) cases metastasizing to the ovary. The role of prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy in CRC is contested in the literature, particularly in premenopausal patients. Further, it is unclear if prophylactic removal of the contralateral ovary is indicated in cases of direct involvement of one ovary to reduce recurrence. Facing a lack of evidence for survival benefit, hormonal complications, and sterilization, some choose to pursue fertility sparing options. For female patients interested in additional pregnancies, the ovaries can be surgically relocated in a prophylactic procedure known as ovarian transposition; as even small doses of radiation to the ovary can effectively sterilize women in their 30 s. We present a case of a 29-year-old female who underwent ovarian transposition of the right ovary before initiating chemoradiation for primary left sided colon adenocarcinoma with direct invasion of the left ovary. Months later, she presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain suspicious for ovarian torsion. On restaging computerized tomography (CT), she was diagnosed with symptomatic right ovarian metastasis in the transposed ovary, requiring reoperation and oophorectomy. For this patient, and for others facing critical decisions about ovarian preservation in advanced colorectal cancer, the question remains how to balance fertility concerns with optimal minimization of metastasis and recurrence."

    "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy (EP) involves the implantation of the gestational sac outside the uterine cavity. In the event of diagnosing an EP, the current medical approach is to avoid surgery and to preserve fertility whenever possible; therefore, methotrexate (MTX)-based therapy has become prominent in recent years. MTX, a drug usually used to treat severe forms of autoimmune diseases and several types of cancer, has proven its utility in the conservative treatment of EPs. The success rate of MTX correlates with lower values of β subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (β-hCG) serum levels, especially below 2,000 mUI/ml, side effects being insignificant. In the present study, the results obtained concerning the success rate of MTX in the conservative treatment of EPs were obtained at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Bucharest University Emergency Hospital from January 2014 to December 2020. The aim of the present study was to highlight the necessity for revising current guidelines for ectopic pregnancy medical treatment in order to manage this pathology optimally and to select carefully the proper treatment, whether medical, surgical or expectant management, so that morbidity is reduced to a minimum."

This multicenter observational study included patients diagnosed prenatally with fetal ovarian cysts and follow-up in the postnatal period. Descriptive statistics were used to render the information regarding the prenatal imaging aspect of the fetal pelvic masses using ultrasound and/or MRI, prenatal surveillance and postnatal neonate's immediate outcome, indications leading to surgery and pathologic aspect. The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 21 patients. The mean gestational age at the time of initial diagnosis was 31.28 weeks of gestation (WG). Only five out of 21 cysts regressed completely during pregnancy without postnatal complications. In addition, 11 out of 21 infant's required surgical treatment in the first two weeks after birth, mainly for ovarian torsion. Five out of 21 neonates were referred to postnatal follow-up clinically and by ultrasound, but three out of five cases required emergency surgical treatment for acute complications. Ultrasound plays a major role in the diagnostic of fetal ovarian cyst. From our experience, MRI does not bring supplementary data or change the management. Spontaneous resolution of fetal ovarian cysts is to be expected but the ovarian mass could lead to serious complications, if resolution does not occur in due time."

The diagnosis is intricate and based on surgical and histopathological observations. Traditional risk factors for ovarian ectopic pregnancy are similar to those for tubal pregnancy, but use of an IUD seems to be disproportionately associated. We report a rare case of spontaneous ectopic ovarian pregnancy of a 40-year-old woman, diagnosed with a ovarian pregnancy by ultrasound and treated by laparotomy in emergency obstetrical department of Ibn Rochd University Hospital of Casablanca. Ovarian ectopic pregnancies occur through fertilization of an egg retained in the peritoneal cavity leading to implantation on the surface of the ovary. The increased incidence of ovarian ectopic pregnancies is associated with the increased use of artificial reproductive technologies (ART) and intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs). The diagnosis is difficult and a constant challenge for the gynecologist. Its management remains surgical therapy despite the progress in medical treatment. Ovarian pregnancy is a rare entity that has some special features. Its diagnosis is difficult and relies on criteria based on intraoperative findings.

In this cross-sectional study conducted in 3 urban EDs, patients under 16 weeks gestation who presented with bleeding and/or cramping completed a 7-item questionnaire. We compared baseline clinical variables and survey responses among patients classified as Critical or Emergent per the American Board of Emergency Medicine's patient acuity definitions with those classified as Lower Acuity to identify independent risk factors for outcomes. Of 484 participants, 21 (4.3%) were classified as Critical or Emergent and required interventions. While no demographic characteristics differentiated Critical patients from Lower Acuity patients, survey questions associated with a higher likelihood of emergency intervention included history of prior ectopic pregnancy (OR 8.7, 95% CI 3.2-23.5) heavy bleeding in the past two hours (OR 11.8, 95% CI 3.8-36.1), as well as having made a prior ED visit in the current pregnancy (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.7-5.1). Joint consideration of these risk factors in a multivariable model performed well at discriminating between Critical and Lower Acuity patients with an area under the ROC curve of 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.93). Patients with a history of ectopic pregnancy, heavy bleeding in the past two hours, and/or prior presentation to the ED in the current pregnancy had the highest risk of needing emergency-level care.

Superfetation refers to the coexistence of 2 or more fetuses of different gestational ages as a result of ovulation, fertilization, and implantation during an ongoing pregnancy. We present a case of heterotopic triplet pregnancy with a difference in gestational age by crown rump length of more than 1 week between the twin intrauterine pregnancy and the singleton tubal ectopic. Case Report: A 31-year-old gravida 3, para 2002 presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain at 9 weeks 2 days' gestation dated by last menstrual period, consistent with ultrasound. She was discharged home with a diagnosis of ruptured hemorrhagic cyst but returned 4 days later with ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy measuring 9 weeks' gestation and ongoing twin gestation measuring 10 weeks 1 day. She was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic salpingectomy, and ectopic pregnancy was confirmed on tissue diagnosis. Conclusion: Heterotopic pregnancy presents a diagnostic challenge for obstetricians/gynecologists. Superfetation has never been demonstrably proven in humans but has been suggested in the literature. This report adds to the literature that perhaps superfetation can be artificially induced in humans in the presence of assisted reproductive technologies."

Diagnosis and treatment require surgery to examine the adnexa, correct the torsion, and determine if cystectomy or oophorectomy are required. We reported the case of a 34-year-old woman who presented 9 days after a dermoid cystectomy with sudden onset abdominal pain. An ultrasound showed abnormal blood flow to the ovary. She then underwent a repeat laparoscopy revealing a necrotic and twisted ovary on the same side that had a cystectomy. The surgeons proceeded with a right oophorectomy. Following surgery, the patient reported no concerns with no ongoing bleeding or pain. OT can present in the short-term postoperatively to an ovarian cystectomy, likely as a result of mechanical forces secondary to structural changes of the ovary.

As uterine rupture due to choriocarcinoma is uncommonly encountered in the clinical practice, its diagnosis is often missed or delayed. We present a case of a 41-year-old para 4 + 1 who had acute abdomen and hypovolaemic shock secondary to haemoperitoneum at three months postpartum period. The urine pregnancy test was positive, and, therefore, a provisional diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was made. She was managed aggressively with fluids and blood product transfusion at the emergency department to achieve haemodynamic stability. Subsequently, she underwent an emergency laparotomy where intraoperatively noted a perforation at the left posterior uterine cornu with purplish tissue spillage. A wedge resection was performed, and the histopathological examination (HPE) was reported as atypical trophoblastic cells, in which choriocarcinoma could not be ruled out. The patient then underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy three weeks later. The final HPE confirmed the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. The clinical presentation of postpartum choriocarcinoma can be indistinguishable from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. A high index of suspicion is crucial to allow early diagnosis."

Laparoscopic surgery confirmed right ovarian torsion with an attached cystic mass, and a right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed given the mass was suspicious for malignancy. Ultrasound is the test of choice for diagnosis of torsion due to its ability to evaluate anatomy and perfusion. When ovarian pathology is on the patient's right, appendicitis is high in the differential diagnosis, and CT may be obtained first. Here we describe a case where CT first accurately diagnosed ovarian torsion by demonstrating the whirlpool sign, despite an US that showed arterial flow to the ovary.

Twisted ovarian cysts are rare in adolescents, but they can cause significant distress to patients. Idiopathic ovarian torsion is uncommon in adolescents and the incidence is reportedly higher in women aged 20 to 40 years. Most twisted cysts in adolescents are benign. In the past, oophorectomy was commonly performed for a torsed ovary, but currently there is a trend toward ovary preservation. The diagnosis of twisted ovarian cyst is based on pathognomonic symptoms and findings from a focused clinical examination and ultrasound. Because the differential diagnosis includes acute appendicitis and gastroenteritis, referral to a gynecologist may be delayed. CASE REPORT We present the case of a huge, twisted ovarian cyst in a 16-year-old girl who presented with an acute abdomen. The initial diagnosis was acute appendicitis, which delayed her referral to a gynecologist. An emergency laparotomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The histopathology of the ovarian cyst was reported as serous cystadenoma. CONCLUSIONS The optimal management of a twisted ovarian cyst in adolescents is the subject of much debate. Here, we review the literature on ovarian torsion in children and adolescents. The patient in the case we present had a twisted ovarian cyst that was managed with salpingo-oophorectomy."

Our patient after admission to the emergency department was diagnosed with a unilateral GS = 9W ectopic pregnancy in the right fallopian tube based on Doppler echography. However, during the surgery, the surgeon discovered a rupture in the left tube, which was discovered to be another left fallopian ectopic pregnancy confirmed by pathology. Our patient presented with typical symptoms of ectopic pregnancy confirmed by BHCG blood test and Doppler ultra sound but the untypical finding of bilateral ectopic pregnancy without suggestive history couldn't be discovered until laparatomy. This case reminds us to always check both adnexa before making any decisions and because of the poor presurgical diagnosis of EP, it highlights the importance of human resources and equipment which could save our patients fertility. To preserve the integrity of the organs and the patient's future fertility the doctor who diagnoses a tubal ectopic pregnancy should always check the other tube before taking action even if the suspicion is not due to the induction of ovulation, and never fully trust imaging study only as an aiding tool to make a diagnosis; nevertheless, the patient could have been better managed and her fertility saved if better capabilities were available."

    "abstract": "There are two major management approach for cornual heterotopic pregnancy, transvaginal cornual embryo reduction with ultrasound guidance, or laparoscopic cornual resection. This no consensus on the optimal management for cornual heterotopic pregnancy. Here, we are trying to determine the optimal management approach for patients with viable cornual heterotopic pregnancy following embryo transfer. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at the locally largest reproductive center of a tertiary hospital. A total of 14 women diagnosed as viable cornual heterotopic pregnancy following embryo transfer. Six patients were treated with cornual pregnancy reduction under transvaginal ultrasound guidance without the use of feticide drug (treatment 1), and eight patients were treated with laparoscopic cornual pregnancy resection (treatment 2). All 14 patients of cornual heterotopic pregnancy following embryo transfer due to fallopian tubal factor, among which, 12 patients had cornual pregnancy occurred in the ipsilateral uterine horn of tubal pathological conditions. Nine (64.29%) showed a history of ectopic pregnancy. Thirteen (92.86%) patients were transferred with two embryos and only one patient had single embryo transferred. Six patients received treatment 1, and 2 (33.33%) had uterine horn rupture and massive bleeding which required emergency laparoscopic surgery for homostasis. No cornual rupture occurred among patients received treatment 2. Each treatment group had one case of spontaneous miscarriage. The remaining 5 cases in treatment 1 group and the remaining 7 cases in treatment 2 group delivered healthy live offspring. Patients with tubal factors attempting for embryo transfer, especially those aiming for multiple embryos transfer, should be informed with risk of cornual heterotopic pregnancy and the subsequent cornual rupture. Compared with cornual pregnancy reduction under transvaginal ultrasound guidance, laparoscopic cornual resection might be a favorable approach for patients with viable cornual heterotopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous expulsion of product of conception through the fimbrial end to the peritoneal cavity is a rare mode of progression of tubal pregnancy. Thus, ectopic pregnancy can present with right-sided iliac fossa pain which can be preoperatively misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis. A 30-year regularly menstruating woman presented with right iliac fossa pain which was diagnosed as acute appendicitis preoperatively with an ultrasound. However, intraoperatively, a product of conception-like material measuring 3 ∗ 3 cm was seen hanging from the right fimbrial end of the fallopian tube with a normal appendix. With an intraoperative diagnosis of spontaneous tubal abortion, histopathology of the resected mass showed chorionic villi lined by trophoblastic cells along with decidualized tissue, fibrinoid material, and blood clot. Ectopic pregnancy presenting as a right iliac fossa pain can mimic acute appendicitis. An abnormal β-hCG pattern/level which doesn't correspond to the gestational age suggests the likely diagnosis of ectopic gestation. Transvaginal ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of patients with suspected ectopic gestation. A urine pregnancy kit cannot always exclude an underlying ectopic pregnancy because of the associated false-negative results. Urgent laparotomy to prevent detrimental complications associated with ectopic gestation should be done. Surgeons should be aware of this suspicion as a false negative UPT can happen and misguide clinicians about the possible occurrence of ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION An intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) is a common contraception method used for family planning. IUCD erosion into adjacent organs is a rare but serious complication of IUCD use. CASE PRESENTATION A 41-year-old female presented to us with a leaking left ectopic pregnancy. Emergency laparotomy and left salpingectomy were performed. A copper ICUD was found intraperitoneally and part of it had completely eroded into the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid colotomy was performed and the IUCD was removed successfully. Further history revealed that the patient had her IUCD inserted 12 years previously but was forgotten. The patient was discharged well after 4 days of admission. DISCUSSION Erosion of an IUCD into the colon is uncommon and may be asymptomatic or present with bowel perforation and obstruction. There should be a high index of suspicion for pregnancy occurring among women post-IUCD insertion. A misplaced IUCD can cause chronic inflammation of the fallopian tube, which may alter tubal functionality and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Family planning is commonly done in primary health care. Primary care education and counselling are essential to improve awareness of fertile women to prevent similar complications. Periodic examination of IUCD string either by users or primary health-care practitioners is crucial. Ultrasound can be advocated if there are difficulties with the insertion. An abdominal radiograph is useful and should be performed in the case of missing IUCDs."

    "abstract": "Background: Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of gestation-related deaths during the first trimester. Cervical twin heterotopic pregnancies, when ectopic, constitute a small and rare part of gynecological surgery. Case Presentation: A 30-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 3, para 2) presented with mild pain in the lower abdomen and traces of bleeding per vaginum for three days. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a balloon-shaped cervical canal with a visible gestational sac measuring 3.5 × 3.9 cm. A second gestational sac was seen in the uterine cavity. The measurements of the gestational sacs corresponded to 7 + 4 weeks' pregnancy. A decision for medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol was made. However, due to an incomplete abortion and continuous bleeding, a curettage was performed. Conclusions: Spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy with the ectopic pregnancy located in the cervix is an extremely rare clinical condition requiring urgent treatment in order to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity and preserve fertility."

    "abstract": "The impact of early pregnancy complications on completed family size is unknown. Here, we hypothesize that early pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes may influence family size. In this nationwide, registry-based study we included all 458 475 women born 1957-1972 who lived in Denmark from age 20-45 years with at least one registered pregnancy. The main outcome of the study was number of children per woman by age 45, estimated using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Exposures were: (a) total number of pregnancy losses experienced (0, 1, 2, ≥3); (b) highest number of consecutive pregnancy losses (0, 1, 2, ≥3); (c) sex of firstborn child; (d) outcome of first pregnancy (live birth, stillbirth, pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy, or molar pregnancy). Number of live births was negatively influenced by maternal age and adverse first pregnancy outcomes, especially ectopic pregnancies. A 30-year-old woman with a first ectopic pregnancy was expected to have 1.16 children (95% CI 1.11-1.22) compared with 1.95 children (95% CI 1.86-2.03) with a first live birth. Three or more consecutive losses also decreased number of live births significantly: 1.57 (95% CI 1.50-1.65) compared with 1.92 (95% CI 1.84-2.0) with only live births. The total number of pregnancy losses had no effect before the age of 35 years. Sex of firstborn had no effect. Previous pregnancy history has a significant effect on number of children per woman, which is important at both individual and societal levels. Pathophysiological research of adverse pregnancy outcomes should be an urgent priority as the causes remain poorly understood."

Our objective was to compare patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy who had an emergency department (ED) point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) with those who received a radiology department-performed ultrasound (RADUS). Four time intervals were measured: ED arrival to ultrasound interpretation, obstetric consultation, operating room (OR) arrival, and ultrasound interpretation to OR arrival. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancy seen between February 2012 and September 2018 at an urban tertiary care hospital. Patients who received an ultrasound in the ED, went directly to the OR, and had confirmed rupture were included. Of 262 patients diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy during the study period, 36 (14%) were ruptured and 32 were enrolled. Comparing times between PoCUS (n = 10) and RADUS (n = 22) groups, the mean time from ED arrival to ultrasound interpretation was 15 vs. 138 min (difference 123, 95% confidence interval [CI] 88-158), from ED arrival to obstetric consultation was 35 vs. 150 min (difference 115, 95% CI 59-171), from ED arrival to OR arrival was 160 vs. 381 min (difference 222, 95% CI 124-320), and from ultrasound interpretation to OR arrival was 145 vs. 243 min (difference 98, 95% CI 12-184).

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) affects 1-2% of all pregnant females'(Barnhart et al., Expert Opin Pharmacother 2(3):409-417, 2001) that can require emergent surgical intervention. Noninvasive diagnostic tests like transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), and serial β-hCG levels have enabled early diagnosis and allowed medical therapy to be tried. Methotrexate (MTX) versus expectant management, both have been considered safe but superiority of one over the other is lacking. We searched for RCT that have shown efficacy of MTX versus expectant management in hemodynamically stable patients. Our primary outcome was whether one modality is superior to the other. Four RCT were included in the meta-analysis after review. Our pooled analysis when comparing MTX and expectant management showed us that the difference between the uneventful decline in β-hCG levels (treatment success) was statistically insignificant (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.93-1.21) with no significant heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.578). The difference between need for surgical intervention between methotrexate and expectant management was also statistically insignificant (RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.43-1.40) with no significant heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.552). We conclude that expectant management is not inferior to MTX in hemodynamically stable patients with ectopic pregnancy that have declining or low β-hCG levels."

In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the prenatal characteristics and postnatal outcomes of AOT. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital records of patients (n = 28) with diagnosis of AOT between 2004 and 2020 were reviewed and their prenatal characteristics, postnatal examination, imaging, operative, and histopathological findings were evaluated. There were 28 patients during the study period. In most of the patients (25/28; 89.3%) AOTs were detected prenatally. All were term babies with a mean birth weight of 3010 ± 466.6 g. Mean maternal age was 25.75 ± 3.65 years. Prenatal history was event-free in all and none had additional anomalies. Physical examination revealed mobile intra-abdominal cystic lesions in 16 (57.1%) patients. AOTs mimicked other pathologies as intestinal duplication cyst or mesenteric cyst (n = 7), complex ovarian cyst (n = 3), mature cystic teratoma (n = 3), simple renal cyst (n = 1), and ectopic kidney (n = 1) in 15 (53.6%) patients in postnatal ultrasonography. Elective laparoscopic surgery was performed in 26 (92.8%) patients. The other 2 patients required emergency open surgery because of acute symptoms. Ovaries were autoamputated in 17 (60.7%) patients. Histopathological examination revealed necrosis and dystrophic calcification in all specimens. There was neoplastic involvement in 2 patients (serous cystadenoma and gonadoblastoma). No complication occurred in the early follow-up period (mean: 73.9 ± 46.8 months). AOTs can be detected easily during the antenatal period. Neoplastic involvement with AOTs is rare but possible. Although AOTs might mimic other cystic pathologies, it should be one of the first diagnoses to be considered, in the presence of a palpable intra-abdominal mass and complex cystic lesion in infant girls. It can be efficiently and safely managed using minimally invasive techniques."

Salpingectomy is proposed as a pretreatment before in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) to reduce the risk of HP. HP after IVF-ET occurs in women who had already underwent bilateral salpingectomy, even though it is extremely rare. A case of a 29-year-old woman with recurrent interstitial HP after IVF-ET following salpingectomy is presented. The main symptom was a sudden and worsening pelvic pain. Physical examinations revealed signs of peritoneal bleeding and irritation with stable vital signs. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a live intrauterine pregnancy and another live embryo with cardiac activity in the left cornu extending beyond the lateral edge of the uterus. Her hemoglobin concentration was 8.0 g/dL, and serum human chorionic gonadotropin value was 171116.9 mIU/mL. With the diagnosis of ruptured HP with internal bleeding, an emergency laparoscopic resection of left cornu was performed. The interstitial pregnancy was removed with caution to protect the intrauterine pregnancy. After the surgical treatment, the intrauterine pregnancy continued with no complications. A healthy baby was delivered by caesarean section at 39 wk. Outcomes of another three cases are further summarized. Post-salpingectomy HP is a rare but challenging condition. Surgical treatment is preferred in the case with a viable intrauterine pregnancy."

    "abstract": "This 10-year retrospective study between 2008 and 2018, aims to investigate the duration of symptoms of ovarian torsion and the subsequent rate of ovarian preservation. Eighty-six women with surgically confirmed ovarian torsion were included. The median duration from the onset of pain symptoms to presentation (26.0 vs 6.0 h, p < .001) and from presentation to surgery (11.0 vs 5.5 h, p = .010) were significantly longer in women who required an oophorectomy compared to women who had conservative surgery. There was no significant difference in symptoms, signs or investigations except ultrasound finding of an enlarged ovary (94.9% vs 76.9%, p = .026). Awareness of the condition among the community and healthcare is crucial and routine investigations should not delay management as positive Doppler flow on ultrasound does not exclude an ovarian torsion.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Ovarian torsion is a gynaecological emergency and may lead to ovarian necrosis, infection and peritonitis. Early recognition is essential in preserving the ovary, particularly in patients with future fertility aspirations. Currently there is no consensus regarding the time period of ovarian viability after the onset of symptoms.What do the results of this study add? We have demonstrated a significant difference in the duration from the onset of symptoms to surgery. Furthermore, the duration from the onset of symptoms to presentation (26.0 vs 6.0 h, p<.001) and from presentation to surgery (11.0 vs 5.5 h, p=.010) were significantly longer in women who required an oophorectomy compared to women who had conservative surgery. There was no significant difference in symptoms, signs or investigations except ultrasound finding of an enlarged ovary.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Women with known ovarian cysts in particular should be educated of the risk of ovarian torsion. Routine investigations should not delay management as it does not exclude an ovarian torsion. Although our study suggests that early presentation and management would reduce the risk of oophorectomy, prospective studies are required to confirm the findings."

The hematic mass, including chorionic villi, was successfully removed from the peritoneum. The subsequent course of the intrauterine pregnancy was uneventful and a healthy baby was born at term. To the best of our knowledge, this is an extremely rare case report of a spontaneously conceived heterotopic abdominal pregnancy, in which the intrauterine pregnancy showed a successful outcome despite the collapse of the abdominal pregnancy at a very early stage."

    "abstract": "The subject, splenic pregnancy, is very rare and interesting with about a few cases reported to date. This case report describes a healthy 17-year-old girl admitted to our hospital who complained of amenorrhea for 30 days, intermittent abdominal pain for 3 days and worsening for 1 h. The serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was greater than 10000.0 IU/L. Pelvic ultrasonography showed a adnexal mass and empty uterine cavity. Due to consideration of \"ectopic pregnancy,\" emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed. However, no clear lesions and bleeding points were detected during the operation. On postoperative day 2, hemoglobin level dropped sharply, meanwhile serum hCG increased significantly. Subsequent ultrasound showed a 4.4 × 4.1 × 2.6 cm gestational sac-like echo below the spleen. Laparotomy detected pregnancy tissues measured 4.0 × 3.5 cm next to the splenic hilum. Finally, the splenectomy was performed. Our case suggests that early diagnosis of splenic pregnancy is very difficult, especially when other conditions are combined. Despite this, we should still enrich ourself medical knowledge and clinical experience, and try to avoid the occurrence of splenic rupture."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to highlight the clinical features, diagnosis, and different modalities of the treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP). This study was done in the tertiary referral hospital of India for one year. A total of 11 cases were enrolled prospectively. In each case, the diagnostic ultrasonography and measurement of baseline beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) levels were done. The treatment was given based on the hemodynamic status of the patient and desire for future fertility. Various treatment modalities used were medical, surgical, or interventional digital subtraction angiography to control hemorrhage. Also, in some cases, ultrasound-guided methotrexate was injected into the scar ectopic. Medically treated cases were followed up until their β-HCG levels became normal. Out of 11 patients, six had a history of two cesarean sections in the past, four patients had a history of one cesarean section and one patient with a previous three low segments cesarean section (LSCS). Seven out of 11 patients underwent medical management with either methotrexate with potassium chloride (KCl) or methotrexate alone. The success of the medical management was monitored by serial β- HCG values. The mean time for the resolution of these 10 patients was 86.7 ± 53.6 days. Three patients underwent emergency uterine artery embolization due to uncontrolled bleeding and one patient required laparotomy. CSP is a life-threatening condition that can be diagnosed with the help of transvaginal ultrasonography. The treatment, however, depends on the hemodynamic status of the patient and desire for future fertility. Well-defined diagnostic criteria coupled with structured management and follow-up protocol can help in treating this challenging form of ectopic pregnancy."

Here, we present the case of a 17-year-old single female who presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal distension and pain for four months. Abdominal examination revealed a left-sided mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a multi-loculated and multi-septated left cystic ovarian mass, suspicious for a teratoma. The patient underwent laparoscopy and a left cystectomy was performed. The final histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with fetiform teratoma. Although extremely rare, ovarian fetiform teratoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of women presenting with an abdominopelvic mass. It should be discerned from fetus-in-fetu and ectopic pregnancy. Careful clinical presentation, laboratory testing for beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, histopathologic examination, and cytogenetic analysis can greatly aid in pinpointing the diagnosis. Overall, fetiform teratoma carries a favorable prognosis; however, follow-up surveillance is advised to monitor for uncommon occasions of tumor persistence or relapse."

Detecting complications of pediatric illness in administrative data would facilitate widespread quality measurement, however the accuracy of such detection is unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients visiting a large pediatric emergency department. We analyzed those <22 years old from 2012 to 2019 with 1 of 14 serious conditions: appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), empyema, encephalitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, ovarian torsion, sepsis, septic arthritis, stroke, and testicular torsion. We applied a method using disposition, diagnosis codes, and procedure codes to identify complications. The automated determination was compared with the criterion standard of manual health record review by using positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). Interrater reliability of manual reviews used a κ. We analyzed 1534 encounters. PPVs and NPVs for complications were >80% for 8 of 14 conditions: appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, sepsis, and testicular torsion. Lower PPVs for complications were observed for DKA (57%), empyema (53%), encephalitis (78%), ovarian torsion (21%), and septic arthritis (64%). A lower NPV was observed in stroke (68%). The κ between reviewers was 0.88. An automated method to measure complications by using administrative data can detect complications in appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, sepsis, and testicular torsion. For DKA, empyema, encephalitis, ovarian torsion, septic arthritis, and stroke, the tool may be used to screen for complicated cases that may subsequently undergo manual review."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is the occurrence of pregnancies in at least two different implantation sites in the same time. The diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy remains one of the greatest challenges of the gynecological-obstetrical emergencies. We report a rare case of spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy of a 32-year-old woman, diagnosed with a heterotopic pregnancy by ultrasound and treated by laparotomy in emergency obstetrical department of Ibn Rochd University Hospital of Casablanca. The existence of intrauterine pregnancy does not exclude an ectopic pregnancy. The occurrence of a spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy without risk factors is a rare event, the clinical symptomatology is often related to a threatened or ongoing abortion, the diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy is not made until the appearance of signs of hemoperitoneum secondary to a ruptured EP, hence the importance of a systematic ultrasound examination of the adnexa during first trimester ultrasound. The standard treatment is conservative surgery, preferably by laparoscopy. Laparotomy retains its indications especially in forms with hemorrhagic shock. With the aim of preserving intrauterine pregnancy while removing ectopic pregnancy. The diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy should not be excluded by the discovery of a UGI in a spontaneous cycle. Diagnosis is often difficult and management should be initiated as soon as possible given the risk of maternal mortality."

A 43-year-old nulliparous woman, presented to the Emergency Room with vaginal bleeding. Initial quantitative serum β-hCG value was 85,220 mIU/mL. Obstetrical ultrasound demonstrated a single, live pregnancy of approximately 9 weeks' gestation located within the endocervix. After discussing different management options, intramuscular methotrexate injection in association with intra-amniotic chloride potassium installation was decided in order to preserve patient's desire for childbearing. Three months later, the patient was readmitted due to a massive vaginal bleeding. Angiographic uterine artery embolization (UAE) with an absorbable gelatin sponge was performed. After the procedure and two days of hospitalization, no significative bleeding was observed. The clinical course was uneventful, and serum human chorionic gonadotropin decreased immediately. The cervical mass gradually shrank and disappeared a month after UAE. To preserve fertility in the management of CEP, clinicians could consider a combination of strategies, including UAE. A review of the current literature and possible treatment options for conservative CEP management are analyzed and discussed."

On an urgent basis, a uterine artery embolization (UAE) was performed by targeting the right femoral artery. Selective catheterization was performed of both uterine arteries and the right side showed a major feeder of the gestational sac. Supplied dose of methotrexate (95mg) was infused in the right uterine artery and both arteries were then embolized by gel foam slurry.

We sought to determine whether transabdominal POCUS by itself or in conjunction with consultative radiology ultrasound (RADUS), reduces Emergency Department (ED) treatment time for patients with ectopic pregnancy requiring operative care, when compared to RADUS alone. A secondary objective was to determine whether the incorporation of POCUS reduces time to operative care for patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancy specifically, when compared to RADUS alone. We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted for operative management of ectopic pregnancy. We excluded patients with known ectopic pregnancy and/or imaging prior to arriving to the treatment area, found not to have an ectopic pregnancy, or did not undergo operative care. Descriptive statistics, classical and nonparametric statistical analysis, and linear regression were performed. There were 220 patients admitted with ectopic pregnancy, 111 met exclusion criteria, yielding 109 for analysis. Of 109, 36 received POCUS (23/36 also had RADUS), while 73 received RADUS only. Among the POCUS group 31/36 (86%) were classified as ruptured versus 47/73 (64%) in the RADUS group. The average ED treatment time in the POCUS group for all admitted ectopic pregnancies was 157.9 min (standard deviation [SD] 101.3) versus 206.3 min (SD 76.6) in the RADUS group (p = 0.0141). The median time to operating room (OR) for ruptured ectopic pregnancies was 203.0 min (interquartile range [IQR] 159.0) in the POCUS group versus 293.0 min (IQR 139.0) in the RADUS group (p = 0.0002). Regression analysis of the primary outcome was limited by multiple interactions and sample size. When controlling for race, positive shock index and ED visit time, POCUS was found to be associated with a significantly shorter time to OR among ruptured ectopic pregnancies compared to RADUS (p = 0.0052). Compared to RADUS alone, incorporation of POCUS was associated with significantly faster ED treatment time for all ectopic pregnancies and significantly faster time to OR for ruptured ectopic pregnancies, even when combined with RADUS. When controlling for clinical differences, time to OR was still faster for patients who underwent POCUS. The integration of POCUS should be considered to expedite care for patients with ectopic pregnancy requiring operative care."

Once suspected, the minimally invasive surgical approach should be considered for its management. An adult P1L1E1 female presented to the surgery OPD with a painless abdominal mass which progressively increased in size in the past 4 months. She underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy 6 months back at some other health centre. On computed tomography scan of the abdomen, a well-defined heterogenous cystic lesion of size 9.8 cm × 9.2 cm × 7 cm was noted intraperitoneally. Few air foci with a hyperdense tubular structure within the lesion were seen, suggestive of a retained surgical sponge with its radio-opaque marker also visualised. The retained sponge was successfully retrieved by the laparoscopic approach. Traditionally, the open approach for the removal of the sponge was more accepted compared to the laparoscopic approach. This was due to the belief that intense foreign body reaction and dense adhesions around the sponge may make the laparoscopic approach difficult. However, laparoscopy can prove to be beneficial with its advantages of early ambulation, reduced post-op pain, cosmetically improved results and shorter length of hospital stay. All precautions must be taken to avoid retention of surgical sponge post-surgery. Case reports in which laparoscopy is used to retrieve gossypiboma are rare. The authors recommend the use of laparoscopy as a therapeutic option in the event of such mishaps."

A retrospective review to evaluate the management of ectopic pregnancy among women in a public hospital system, including all women undergoing treatment for ectopic pregnancy from 2012 to 2017. Data were abstracted from the medical record. Women who were adherent to follow-up were compared to those who were non-adherent. Log-binomial regression was used to identify factors associated with management type and adherence to follow-up of medical management. Of 283 women diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, 182 (64.3%) were managed surgically and 101 (35.7%) were managed with methotrexate. Among non-emergent cases, presence of fetal cardiac activity, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level ≥5000mIU/mL, ectopic size ≥3.5 cm, and multigravid status was associated with surgical management. Among patients receiving methotrexate, 66 (65.3%) adhered to required lab draws 4 and 7 days following methotrexate administration (+/-1 day). Among those receiving methotrexate 45.5% (n = 46) were lost to follow-up. Lower prevalence of adherence to follow-up (i.e. lab draws completed until pregnancy levels were negative) was observed among non-Hispanic African American (RR=0.64, 95%CI 0.45-0.94) compared to white women and women with multigravid status (RR=0.67, 95%CI 0.48-0.95) after adjustment.

Primary omental pregnancy is the least common form of abdominal ectopic pregnancies, making it extremely rare. Typical presentation includes pelvic pain, secondary amenorrhea, with or without vaginal bleeding. Atypical presentations range from nonspecific pain to asymptomatic. A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after several syncopal episodes. She had a positive urine pregnancy test (serum hCG 446 IU/L). Her hemoglobin level was 10.6 g/dL. Due to lack of pain or bleeding, abdominal imaging was not indicated. A head CT scan rendered negative results. She was subsequently diagnosed with idiopathic headaches and anemia and was discharged. She returned to hospital 48 h later with vaginal bleeding and additional syncopal episodes. She was not experiencing any abdominal pain or discomfort. Her anemia worsened (hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL). For this reason, imaging was performed. It was significant for massive hemoperitoneum. Due to the imaging findings and worsening anemia, diagnostic exploratory laparoscopy was recommended to evaluate for ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopic findings revealed large hemoperitoneum and a 10-week gestational sac attached to the greater omentum near the transverse colon. This exceedingly rare presentation of extrauterine ectopic pregnancy offered few clinical clues other than worsening anemia until imaging later revealed the abnormality. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a potentially fatal complication of pregnancy, should be included into the differential diagnosis of any gravid patient with syncope and anemia unexplained by extensive diagnostic workup."

Rates increased for older Black women aged 25 to 39 years and all White women. The Black/White rate ratio decreased across age groups. We examined whether trends in reported rates reflected changing prevalence or changing screening. We analyzed trends in reported chlamydia and gonorrhea rates from 2010 to 2018 among women in the United States aged 15 to 39 years by age and race/ethnicity subgroup, state, and reporting source. Most jurisdictions reported decreased chlamydia and gonorrhea rates among Black teens and increased rates among White teens and older women. Between 2010 and 2018, public clinics reported fewer cases, especially among young Black women, that were not restored by increases elsewhere. We reviewed literature on trends in screening, prevalence, and sequelae. Family planning clinics annual reports showed chlamydia tests among women younger than 25 years decreased by 541,573 tests (-38%) in 2018 compared with 2010 and the number of women visiting sexually transmitted disease clinics had decreased 50% by 2016 compared with 2010. Prevalence of chlamydia in a sentinel population (Job Corps) was unchanged for Black women younger than 25 years and increased for Whites aged 20 to 24 years. Sequelae trends using data from a large all-payer emergency department database were mixed: pelvic inflammatory disease decreased, whereas ectopic pregnancy increased. Decreases in testing at public clinics likely missed diagnoses among young Black women, a group traditionally at highest risk and in need of more testing. Innovative approaches to screening are needed."

These deaths occur predominantly in district hospitals, with the final cause of death being hypovolaemic shock in almost all cases. In most cases, no anaesthesia was attempted despite the district hospitals having the clinical skills, equipment and infrastructure to provide a caesarean delivery service. It appears that there is a skills gap between the provision of anaesthesia for caesarean delivery and that of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. There is a growing recognition of the urgent need to prioritise the provision of emergency surgical care in rural settings. This should be viewed not as a luxury but as an absolute necessity. In this study, we aim to discuss the pathophysiology of a patient with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy briefly, outline district hospital requirements for safe surgery and then discuss a simple, safe method for the provision of anaesthesia in patients deemed too unstable to transfer to a referral facility."

We sought to evaluate emergency department visits for common abdominal and gynecologic conditions before and at the beginning of the pandemic to determine whether changes in emergency department attendance had serious consequences for patients. We conducted a population-based analysis using administrative data to evaluate the weekly rate of emergency department visits pre-COVID-19 (Jan. 1-Mar. 10, 2020) and during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (Mar. 11-June 30, 2020), compared with a historical control period (Jan. 1-July 1, 2019). All residents of Ontario, Canada, presenting to the emergency department with appendicitis, cholecystitis, ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage were included. We evaluated weekly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of emergency department visits, management strategies and clinical outcomes. Across all study periods, 39 691 emergency department visits met inclusion criteria (40.2 % appendicitis, 32.1% miscarriage, 21.3% cholecystitis, 6.4% ectopic pregnancy). Baseline characteristics of patients presenting to the emergency department did not vary across study periods. After an initial reduction in emergency department visits, presentations for cholecystitis and ectopic pregnancy quickly returned to expected levels. However, presentations for appendicitis and miscarriage showed sustained reductions (IRR 0.61-0.80), with 1087 and 984 fewer visits, respectively, after the start of the pandemic, relative to 2019. Management strategies, complications and mortality rates were similar across study periods for all conditions. Although our study showed evidence of emergency department avoidance in Ontario during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, no adverse consequences were evident. Emergency care and outcomes for patients were similar before and during the pandemic."

We conducted a retrospective population-based study using data for Ontario, Canada, from Apr. 1, 2002, to Dec. 31, 2015. We used Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) databases to identify deaths during inpatient, emergency department and same-day surgery encounters. We captured Vital Statistics deaths in the Office of the Registrar General, Deaths (ORGD) data set. Deaths were considered within 42 days and within 365 days after a pregnancy outcome (live birth, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or induced abortion) for all multiple and singleton pregnancies. We calculated agreement statistics and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among 1 679 455 live births and stillbirths, 398 pregnancy-related deaths in the ORGD data set were mapped to a birth in CIHI databases, and 77 (16.2%) were not. Among 2 039 849 recognized pregnancies, 534 pregnancy-related deaths in the ORGD data set were linked to CIHI records, and 68 (11.3%) were not. Among live births and stillbirths, after pregnancy-related deaths in the ORGD data set not matched to a maternal death in the CIHI databases were removed, concordance measures between CIHI and ORGD records for maternal death within 42 days after delivery included a κ value of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82-0.91) and positive percent agreement of 0.88 (95% CI 0.83-0.94). The corresponding measures were similar for maternal death within 42 days after the end of a recognized pregnancy. When unlinked pregnancy-related deaths in the ORGD data set were retained, agreement measures declined for death within 42 days after a live birth or stillbirth (κ = 0.68, 95% CI 0.62-0.74). For maternal death within 365 days after a live birth or stillbirth, or after the end of a recognized pregnancy, the concordance statistics were generally favourable when unlinked pregnancy-related deaths in the ORGD data set were removed but were substantially declined when they were retained. Maternal mortality cannot be ascertained solely with the use of hospital data, including beyond 42 days after the end of pregnancy.

    "abstract": "A retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy is an extremely rare type of ectopic pregnancy and is difficult to diagnose and treat. Owing to its occult onset, it is life-threatening and often associated with high mortality. A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department of our hospital owing to soreness of the left lower quadrant of the abdomen and amenorrhea for 60 days. Dilatation and curettage were performed at a local hospital to induce abortion, but no gestational sac was found. Elevated plasma human chorionic gonadotropin levels suggested an ectopic pregnancy. An ultrasound showed an approximately 4.0 cm × 3.0 cm mass in front of the middle and upper poles of the left kidney. The plasma beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 99 286.00 mIU/mL. Under laparoscopy, an ovoid mass measuring approximately 4.0 cm × 5.0 cm below the left renal vessels and the abdominal aorta was successfully resected. Methotrexate (50 mg/m2) was locally injected, and the retroperitoneum was sutured. Villi were observed in histopathologic sections. This case report highlights the importance of considering the possibility of a retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy for patients with abdominal pain. Laparoscopic surgery by an experienced surgeon is the preferred method of treatment for this condition."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecopathology that requires emergency surgery in women. However, ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) occurs after treatment with detorsion. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor JZL184 on ovarian IRI and ovarian reserve. Forty-eight female Wistar albino rats were divided into six groups. Group 1: Sham, Group 2: Ischemia, Group 3: ischemia/reperfusion (IR), Group 4: IR + JZL184 4 mg/kg, Group 5: IR + JZL184 16 mg/kg, Group 6: IR + vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide). Three hours of ischemia followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Two different doses of JZL184 (4 and 16 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally in Group 4 and 5, 30 min before reperfusion. Ovarian IRI and ovarian reserve were evaluated in serum and tissue by using histopathological and biochemical parameters. Treatment with JZL184 was associated with a significant increase in ovarian 2-arachidonoylglycerol and improved serum anti-Mullerian hormone, İnhibin B, primordial follicle count, and ovarian histopathological damage score (p < 0.05). JZL184 treatment significantly decreased the level of malondialdehyde, and increased superoxide dismutase enzyme activity and glutathione (GSH) levels (p < 0.05). The increased phosphorile nuclear factor-κB (Phospho-NF-κB-p65), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), and TUNEL assay immunopositivity scores in ovarian I/R injury were decreased after treatment with JZL184 (p < 0.05). JZL184 showed significant ameliorative effects on ovarian IRI and ovarian reserve caused by IR through acting as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic agent. Thus, JZL184 may be a novel therapeutic agent for ovarian IRI."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) is a medical emergency which can have significant clinical consequences. It is surgically treated by either detorsion with or without oophoropexy, or oophorectomy. In this report, a case of left OT is described after prior hysterectomy and bilateral prophylactic oophoropexy three years prior. The patient presented with progressive left flank and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of torsion was made using a combination of CT and MR imaging with confirmation at surgery and pathology. At laparoscopic surgery, the left ovary was found at the level of iliac crest posterior to the descending colon. The ovary was torsed with hemorrhagic infarction. It was successfully removed. The patient was discharged postoperative day one and is now free of symptoms and complaints. OT is rarely reported after hysterectomy and oophoropexy. This case demonstrates that OT should be kept in the differential even in patients post hysterectomy and/or oophoropexy."

    "abstract": "Objective: Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a serious condition. Delayed diagnosis could lead to life-threatening outcomes. The study aimed to develop a diagnostic predictive model for EP to approach suspected cases with prompt intervention before the rupture occurred. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study enrolled 347 pregnant women presenting first-trimester complications (abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding) with diagnosis suspected of pregnancy of unknown location, who were eligible and underwent chart review. The data including clinical risk factors, signs and symptoms, serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and ultrasound findings were analyzed. The statistical predictive score was developed by performing logistic regression analysis. The testing data of 30 patients were performed to test the validation of predictive scoring. Results: From a total of 22 factors, logistic regression method-derived scoring model was based on five potent factors (history of pelvic inflammatory disease, current use of emergency pills, cervical motion tenderness, serum hCG ≥1,000 mIU/ml, and ultrasound finding of adnexal mass) using a cutoff score ≥3. This predictive index score was able to determine ectopic pregnancy with an accuracy of 77.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 73.1-82.1], specificity of 91.0% (95% CI = 62.1-72.0), sensitivity of 67.0% (95% CI = 88.0-94.0), and area under the curve of 0.906 (95% CI = 0.875-0.937). In the validation group, no patient with negative result of this score had an EP. Conclusion: Statistical predictive score was derived with high accuracy and applicable performance for EP diagnosis. This score could be used to support clinical decision making in routine practice for management of EP."

    "abstract": "What are the important risk factors for having a caesarean scar pregnancy (CSP)? Independent risk factors were smoking in the first trimester, higher parity, and previous caesarean section (CS) before the index caesarean delivery. A spectrum of risk factors for CSP has been suggested but not proven: parity, number of previous caesarean section, elective as opposed to emergency CS, IVF-pregnancy, breech presentation, previous gynaecological surgery as well as suture technique. This retrospective case-control study included 31 women with a CSP during the period 2003-2018 treated at a tertiary care centre for gynaecology and reproduction. A control cohort of 8300 women with a history of a CS and a subsequent delivery during the same time period was formed. Variables describing demography, lifestyle factors, and reproductive and obstetric history were retrieved from medical records and the obstetric hospital database. Logistic regression analyses were applied to identify potential risk factors. In a multivariable analysis, smoking in first trimester (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.03, 95% CI 1.01-9.07), higher parity (adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64) and previous CS in addition to the preceding CS (adjusted OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.35-8.66) were independently predictive of a CSP. An elective CS at the index pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of CSP but did not remain significant in the multivariable analysis. CSP is a very rare phenomenon and several of the risk factor estimates are imprecise. Nevertheless, significant risk factors could be identified. Another limitation is the lack of electronically recorded details on suture techniques. The identified factors, namely higher parity and previous CS before the index caesarean section, are in accordance with previously suggested risk factors. Whether there is a true risk association between elective CS and future CSP needs to be investigated further. Smoking in the first trimester is a new finding, which has a plausible rationale. These factors should be recognised when counselling women after a caesarean delivery, particularly in a subsequent pregnancy with early complications. This work was supported by a grant from the Swedish state under the agreement between the Swedish government and the county councils the ALF-agreement (ALFGBG-720291). None of the authors has any conflict of interest to declare."

    "abstract": "Primary: Analyze the Adverse Events (AEs) reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after use of mifepristone as an abortifacient. Secondary: Analyze maternal intent after ongoing pregnancy and investigate hemorrhage after mifepristone alone. Adverse Event Reports (AERs) for mifepristone used as an abortifacient, submitted to the FDA from September 2000 to February 2019, were analyzed using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv3). The FDA provided 6158 pages of AERs. Duplicates, non-US, or AERs previously published (Gary, 2006) were excluded. Of the remaining, there were 3197 unique, US-only AERs of which there were 537 (16.80%) with insufficient information to determine clinical severity, leaving 2660 (83.20%) Codable US AERs. (Figure 1). Of these, 20 were Deaths, 529 were Life-threatening, 1957 were Severe, 151 were Moderate, and 3 were Mild. The deaths included: 9 (45.00%) sepsis, 4 (20.00%) drug toxicity/overdose, 1 (5.00%) ruptured ectopic pregnancy, 1 (5.00%) hemorrhage, 3 (15.00%) possible homicides, 1 (5.00%) suicide, 1 (5.00%) unknown. (Table 1). Retained products of conception and hemorrhage caused most morbidity. There were 75 ectopic pregnancies, including 26 ruptured ectopics (includes one death). There were 2243 surgeries including 2146 (95.68%) D&Cs of which only 853 (39.75%) were performed by abortion providers. Of 452 patients with ongoing pregnancies, 102 (22.57%) chose to keep their baby, 148 (32.74%) had terminations, 1 (0.22%) miscarried, and 201 (44.47%) had unknown outcomes. Hemorrhage occurred more often in those who took mifepristone and misoprostol (51.44%) than in those who took mifepristone alone (22.41%). Significant morbidity and mortality have occurred following the use of mifepristone as an abortifacient. A pre-abortion ultrasound should be required to rule out ectopic pregnancy and confirm gestational age. The FDA AER system is inadequate and significantly underestimates the adverse events from mifepristone. A mandatory registry of ongoing pregnancies is essential considering the number of ongoing pregnancies especially considering the known teratogenicity of misoprostol. The decision to prevent the FDA from enforcing REMS during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be reversed and REMS must be strengthened."

A 40-year-old G5P3013 woman at approximately 7 weeks of pregnancy was referred to our emergency department because of abnormally rising β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a cystic structure measuring 2.8 × 1.6 ×1.9 cm in the posterior cul-de-sac distinct from the cervix. The mass was noted to have peripheral hypervascularity and a thickened wall. A moderate amount of complex free fluid was noted adjacent to the mass. The patient's baseline β-human chorionic gonadotropin level and hematocrit were 6,810.7 mIU/mL and 42.4%, respectively. Laparoscopy for suspected AEP. Laparoscopic excision of a primary AEP. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a normal uterus, normal right ovary, normal left ovary with a corpus luteal cyst, and normal bilateral fallopian tubes without dilatation or hemorrhage. The AEP was noted in the right posterior cul-de-sac and was excised from the underlying peritoneum. The left lateral aspect of the AEP extended into the posterior vaginal wall. The patient was admitted for overnight observation, and her postoperative hematocrit was 35.1%. AEPs are extremely rare and account for 1% of all ectopic pregnancies. Approximately 90% of AEPs require surgical management. Historically, AEPs were treated with laparotomy because of the high risk of hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. However, as exemplified by the current case, laparoscopy is a safe and feasible option for surgical management of AEPs."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstructions (SBO) are a commonly encountered diagnosis within emergency departments. Typically, these patients have evident risk factors including, but not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, femoral and inguinal hernias, or neoplasm. In this case, we describe an SBO in a female, professional athlete whose swift, severe symptom onset, rapid resolution with conservative treatment, lack of identifiable risk factors, and prompt return to high level competition without recurrence are certainly unique. A female professional basketball player in her mid-20's with no past medical history presented with a seven-hour history of worsening abdominal pain beginning in the epigastric region and migrating to the right lower quadrant. Physical exam did not reveal abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, or high-pitched bowel sounds. Initial differential diagnosis included appendicitis, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and other genitourinary pathology. Computed tomography with contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally, consistent with an SBO. Symptoms resolved after 24 hours with conservative treatment, including decompression with a nasogastric tube. The athlete returned to full participation five days after initial presentation without recurrence of symptoms. Outpatient gastroenterology workup was negative for predisposing conditions. This presentation is rare in the absence of bowel pathology, family history, or prior abdominal surgery. Perhaps, her profession as an athlete, with frequent air travel and extensive exercise, may have contributed to this unique presentation. This case report should serve as a reminder to all providers that SBOs can occur in young, active patients devoid of risk factors. Even in the absence of typical signs on physical examination, providers should use imaging as adjuncts based on their clinical gestalt and utilize conservative management, when appropriate, to maximize chances of recovery with minimal morbidity."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a known cause of maternal mortality and may be misdiagnosed in up to 50% of pregnant female individuals (Ann Emerg Med. 1996;28(1):10-17). Magnetic resonance imaging, with its superior soft tissue resolution, is a valuable alternative diagnostic modality to diagnose EP when transvaginal ultrasound results are inconclusive. Although an extrauterine gestational sac is the most specific finding, there are other key MRI findings that can aid in diagnosing EP. As availability of MRI access in the emergency department setting increases across the nation, its utility in women with a positive pregnancy test has also increased. Specific MRI findings that are diagnostic of EP include absence of intrauterine pregnancy, adnexal mass separate from the ovary, and hemoperitoneum. In addition, intrauterine ectopic locations, especially intramural, cornual, and cervical pregnancies, can be diagnosed with increased accuracy with the help of MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging is also useful in excluding potential mimics of EP, including adnexal cysts, ovarian neoplasms, and fibroids. In summary, providing an accurate diagnosis and determining the precise location of an EP, which is supported by the use of MRI, is imperative for guiding a patient's treatment to prevent a potentially fatal outcome."

    "abstract": "We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging compared with computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) when evaluating for five common pelvic pathologies among women presenting to the emergency department (ED) with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. This prospective, single-center study was conducted at an academic ED as a sub-analysis of a direct comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of CT and MR in the evaluation of appendicitis. Patients were eligible for participation in the parent study if they were at least 12 years old and had a CT performed for evaluation of possible appendicitis. In the current study, only female patients who also underwent pelvic US were included. Three radiologists independently interpreted each MR examination specifically for the presence of pelvic pathology, knowing that patients had initially undergone imaging evaluation for possible appendicitis. The determination of an independent expert panel of two radiologists and one emergency physician based on surgical pathology, comprehensive chart review, clinical information, and follow-up phone calls served as the reference standard. Test characteristics of MR, CT, and US were calculated based on this; the main outcome measure was the summary sensitivity and specificity of MR versus CT and US. Forty-one participants were included with a mean age of 27.6 ± 10.8 years. The MR consensus interpretation had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 57.1% (CI 38.8-75.5%) and 97.2% (CI 94.7-99.6%) respectively, for detecting any of the five pelvic pathologies. By comparison, CT exhibited sensitivity and specificity of 66.7% (CI 50.0-83.5%) and 98.3% (CI 96.4-100.0%) while it was 64.3% (CI 46.5-82.0%) and 97.7% (CI 95.6-99.9%) for US, respectively. No significant differences were identified when comparing these modalities. Overall, Fleiss' kappa interrater reliability value for MR interpretation was 0.75, corresponding to substantial agreement between the three readers. In women who might otherwise undergo multiple imaging tests to evaluate gastrointestinal versus pelvic pathologies, our data suggest that MR may be an acceptable first-line imaging test."

A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 1, presented to the emergency department at 6 weeks and 4 days of gestation with a live twin ectopic pregnancy diagnosed on a dating ultrasound scan. Given the high likelihood of rupture, she underwent a laparoscopic salpingectomy and was discharged home the following day. The patient was followed-up with weekly serum β-hCG tests, to ensure there was no remaining pregnancy. While the morbidity and mortality associated with singleton ectopic pregnancies has gradually declined, the risk of rupture is higher in twin ectopic pregnancies and rupture is estimated to occur in 30-50% of cases. Surgical intervention remains the mainstay of treatment for these pregnancies."

Of the 44 patients diagnosed with CSP between January 2015 and April 2019, 42 who provided consent for the termination of pregnancy and who simultaneously underwent the transabdominal ultrasound-guided suction curettage + Foley balloon treatment were included in the study. These patients were then contacted and interviewed to collect data concerning their post-treatment number of pregnancies, number of miscarriages, number of live or dead births, mode of delivery, delivery time as well as whether any abnormal placental invasion or uterine ruptures developed. Transabdominal ultrasound-guided suction curettage + Foley balloon was simultaneously performed as the first-line treatment in 42 patients with CSP. In two of these cases, wherein post-treatment level of β-hCG reached a plateau, single-dose systemic methotrexate was administered. Emergency surgical intervention, hysterectomy, massive blood transfusion and additional systemic methotrexate administration were not required. Twenty-six of 42 patients could be contacted. 18/26 were trying to conceive. 6/18 patients had secondary infertility, and 12/18 patients managed to conceive. 8/12 had caesarean delivery at full term. 1/12 was 16-week pregnant, 1/12 had tubal ectopic pregnancy and 2/12 had first-trimester abortus. When administered as the first-line treatment for CSP, the suction curettage + Foley balloon treatment is a highly successful, cheap and easily performed minimally invasive method that requires only a short hospital stay, making it comfortable for patients. Compared with other uterine-sparing methods, it does not harm fertility and has positive effects on patients' future fertility outcomes."

Thirty-one case reports were identified, of which 4 have been excluded because they were not written in English. A 36-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with haemorrhagic shock. Despite the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) being in situ for 4 months, urinary and serum tests were both positive for pregnancy, and an ultrasound scan revealed haemoperitoneum suggestive of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. An emergency Pfannenstiel laparotomy was performed and a diagnosis of spontaneous tubal abortion was made and the abdomen was subsequently closed. Following a period of cardiovascular instability on the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively, an urgent CT scan was performed which revealed bleeding from the spleen. A midline laparotomy was performed by the general surgeon, which involved resection of the gestational sac and splenorrhaphy. Twenty-seven cases were reviewed, and 73% of them presented as an emergency and 21 cases (81%) had been managed with splenectomy. CT scan had been used in eight of the previous case reports of splenic ectopic pregnancy with 100% diagnostic accuracy rate. Non-tubal ectopic pregnancies are very rare. Splenorrhaphy is a safe alternative to splenectomy in cases of splenic ectopic pregnancy. CT abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast can be very helpful in relatively stable patients with a vaginal ultrasound demonstrating an empty uterus, no clear adnexal masses or free fluid."

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis, treatment and complications of women presenting with a tubal Ectopic Pregnancy (EP). This is a single centre retrospective cohort study. We compared the clinical presentation, treatment modalities and complications of all women presenting in our institution with a tubal EP during the COVID-19 pandemic between 15 March and 15 June 2020, with women who were treated in our institution with the same diagnosis in the corresponding period for the years 2018-2019. The study group included 19 cases of EP (N = 19) that were treated between the 15 March 2020 and 15 June 2020. The control group included 30 cases of EP (N = 30) that were admitted to in the corresponding period during 2018 and 2019. Maternal age, parity, gravity and mode of conception (natural vs. assisted) were similar between the two groups. There was no difference in the mean gestational age (GA) according to the last menstrual period. In the study group more women presented with sonographic evaluation of high fluid volume in the abdomen than in the control group (53 % vs 17 %, P value 0.01). This finding is correlated with a more advanced disease status. In the study group there was a highly statistically significant 3-fold increase in rupture among cases (P < 0.005) and a 4-fold larger volume of blood in the entrance to the abdomen (P < 0.002). We found that there were no cases of ruptured EP in the group of women who were pregnant after assisted reproduction. We found a higher rate of ruptured ectopic pregnancies in our institution during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed a 7 cm mass with ample blood supply invading the muscularis layer around the right uterine cornua. Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee approval was obtained. After pelvic adhesiolysis, retroperitoneum was dissected and the bilateral uterine arteries were exposed. To reduce the possibility of massive hemorrhage, titanium clips were used to temporarily block the bilateral uterine arteries. Laparoscopic inspection showed the mass as dark and blue, consistent with the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy. After removal of the cornual lesion, 2-0 Vicryl was used to reconstruct the uterine cornua. At the end of the surgery, the titanium clips were removed to reverse the uterine blood supply. The surgery lasted for about 2 hours, with estimated blood loss of only 50 mL. The patient recovered completely and was discharged 2 days postoperatively, without any further bleeding or postoperative complications. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of cornual pregnancy. One month later, the β-hCG levels decreased to within normal range. At 6-month postoperative follow-up, ultrasound examination showed a normal size uterus. Temporary blockage of the uterine artery during surgery could prevent heavy blood loss, especially in difficult surgeries such as myomectomy for complex uterus fibromas or adenomyomectomy. Moreover, this technique would be feasible for emergent cases, including conservative surgery for cesarean scar pregnancy, and could also replace traditional uterine artery embolization for treating cornual pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a rare gynecological emergency in children and an early surgical intervention is needed to salvage the ovary. Herein, we present a case of eight year old girl who presented with complaints of lower abdominal pain during ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. She was diagnosed as a case of ovarian torsion on right side. She underwent exploratory laparotomy and ovarian cystectomy was performed. Delay in diagnosis and treatment of ovarian torsion may have grave consequences, resulting in functional loss of the ovary."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is commonly considered in the differential diagnosis for first-trimester vaginal bleeding and acute abdominal pain in women of reproductive age. Negative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests have been considered the gold standard to rule out this life-threatening diagnosis and appropriately rising hCG levels are thought to exclude it as well. In the unique case reported here, pathology confirmed ectopic pregnancy is identified in the setting of a negative serum hCG test. The patient was a 23-year-old woman (with one living child and one earlier miscarriage) who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding and syncope. She was tachycardic but normotensive and had both a negative serum hCG test and a negative urine hCG test. Imaging demonstrated a hemoperitoneum and right adnexal mass. She was taken for emergency exploratory surgery. The right fallopian tube had a tubal mass consistent with an ectopic pregnancy as well as 500 mL of blood. Pathology confirmed the ectopic pregnancy. A literature review revealed only two prior documented cases of pathology-confirmed ectopic pregnancy in the setting of a negative serum hCG test. The patient had experienced an abortion two months earlier without a documented intrauterine pregnancy. Her hCG levels were followed to <5 mIU/mL and she had not yet had return of menses at the time of her presentation. Perhaps a chronic ectopic could explain this unusual case. This case highlights that an ectopic pregnancy should never be excluded from the differential diagnosis in a woman of reproductive age."

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess the rates of overall diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (EP), treatment modality and associated complications during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the exact time period in the previous year (pre-COVID-19). A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single referral regional center (Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel). Prevalence of the diagnosis of EP, treatment modality and associated complications during the COVID-19 lockdown period in the state of Israel (March 10-May 12, 2020) was compared to patients receiving the same diagnosis during the parallel timeframe in the previous year (2019). Overall there were 29 and 43 cases of EP during the COVID-19 and pre COVID-19 epoch, respectively. COVID-19 period patients presented to the emergency room with significantly higher β-human chorionic gonadotrophin level; median of 1364 versus 633 IU, P = 0.001. The rate of ruptured EP was; 20.7% versus 4.3% P = 0.031, and surgical approach; 55.2% versus 27.9%, P = 0.001. Significantly higher median volume of blood loss; median volume 852 versus 300 ml, P = 0.042 were observed in patients during the COVID-19 epoch. The COVID-19 pandemic led to delayed presentation of patients with EP, and the requirement of subsequent emergency surgical management and excessive blood loss. Special attention should be given to the decline in routine medical care during the pandemic."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the commonest non-gynaecological surgical emergency in pregnancy. However, the concurrent occurrence of acute appendicitis with a heterotopic pregnancy is a rare event and presents diagnostic challenges to unsuspecting clinicians and sonographers. We present a case of a woman who had a heterotopic pregnancy and was noted to have a gangrenous appendicitis at laparotomy, illustrating how a diagnosis of acute appendicitis could easily be missed in pregnancy. We report the case of a 34-year-old woman in the first trimester of pregnancy who had a missed diagnosis of acute appendicitis after she had complained of vague abdominal symptoms for three weeks. She presented to a gynaecologist with vaginal bleeding for three days and was noted to have a heterotopic pregnancy on ultrasound scan. At laparotomy, she was noted to have a gangrenous appendicitis with pyoperitoneum concurrent with a ruptured left fimbrial ectopic pregnancy. Left salpingectomy and saline lavage were done and she had uneventful post-operative recovery. Unsuspecting clinicians, in patients without risk factors, can miss both heterotopic pregnancy and acute appendicitis. As assisted reproductive techniques become widespread, the possibility of heterotopic pregnancies must always be considered and any patient who presents with vague abdominal symptoms must be suspected to have the possibility of acute appendicitis. Because of the unreliability of laboratory investigations and clinical predictive scores in pregnancy, sonographers must be specifically asked to scan for heterotopic pregnancy and appendicitis in suspected cases."

The technique of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (V-NOTES) for the management of ectopic pregnancy is presented herein. The procedure is illustrated by an instructive video article that standardizes the essential steps to make the technique ergonomic and easy to perform (step-by-step explanations). This surgical technique allows to consider vaginal salpingectomy using a combined cœlio-vaginal approach. After a posterior colpotomy, an Alexis retractor was inserted in the pouch of Douglas followed by the placement of a dedicated platform on which three trocars were fixed. Pneumoperitoneum was then achieved. Once the diagnosis of ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy was established, a salpingectomy was performed. As a minimally invasive approach, this procedure has high patient acceptance and seems to improve favorable clinical outcomes."

The majority of cases are diagnosed in the first trimester. We present a unique case of HP diagnosed at 26 weeks of spontaneous pregnancy in a patient without any relevant risk factors. We performed an extensive review of HP cases from MEDLINE (PUBMED) published in English between 2005-2019 to prove this case's uniqueness. A 24-year-old woman presented because of threatened preterm birth. Despite treatment, pain aggravated, without progression of labor. An emergency ultrasound exam revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity. Suspicion of active bleeding prompted the medical team to perform an exploratory laparotomy. The surgery team found a ruptured heterotopic pregnancy. This was an unexpected cause of nontraumatic hemoperitoneum at such advanced gestational age. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the intrauterine pregnancy continued to term. The final review included 86 out of 124 records. A total number of 509 cases were identified, but not all of them had complete data. The maximum reported gestational age at the time of diagnosis was 16 weeks of pregnancy, while our case became symptomatic and was diagnosed at 26 weeks of pregnancy. Regardless of pregnancy age, HP can be a cause of hemoperitoneum, and it should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in the second trimester."

    "abstract": "This simulation is intended for all levels of emergency medicine residents. Syncope and near-syncope are very common presenting complaints to the emergency department.1 There are several causes of syncope ranging from benign to life threatening. It is imperative that the emergency physician is able to evaluate and treat patients with undifferentiated syncope even with limited information. Approximately half of syncope cases can be differentiated by the presentation and clinical context.1 In addition to a thorough history, an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained on all patients presenting with syncope or near-syncope since it is non-invasive and cost effective in assessing cardiac causes of syncope. In this particular simulation, the cause of syncope is due to a hemorrhagic shock from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. At the conclusion of this simulation, the learner will be able to:Review the initial management of syncopeUtilize laboratory and imaging techniques to diagnose a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.Demonstrate the ability to resuscitate and disposition an unstable ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This simulation case was designed as a medium-to-high fidelity simulation scenario. It could also be altered and utilized as a practice oral board exam case. The quality of the simulation and educational content was evaluated by debriefing and verbal feedback that was obtained immediately after the case. Additionally, a survey was emailed to participants and observers of the case to provide qualitative feedback. Post-simulation feedback from learners and observers was positive. Everyone present for the simulation felt that it was realistic and provided a unique opportunity to practice resuscitation skills. Syncope and near-syncope are common presentations to the emergency department with multiple etiologies that range from cardiac, neurologic, neurocardiogenic, and orthostatic to unknown. It is crucial that we diagnose and treat life-threatening causes of syncope rapidly and with limited information. In this case, the cause of syncope due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy should be rapidly diagnosed with a thorough history and exam, urine pregnancy test, and a bedside abdominal ultrasound. Once the urine pregnancy test was resulted, ectopic pregnancy was the top differential diagnosis for each learner that participated. Initially, most learners only performed a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound of the pelvis, which is normal in the case. One learner performed a rapid ultrasound for shock and hypotension (RUSH) exam and was able to find free fluid in the right upper quadrant. Overall, this case and the debriefing topics were effective for learners at all levels. Ectopic pregnancy, obstetrical emergencies, ultrasound, resuscitation."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecological surgical emergency whose diagnosis remains a challenge. Torsion occurs most frequently in women of reproductive age. It is usually associated with the presence of benign masses in the ovary, as malignant tumors are less frequent and less prone to undergo torsion. We report the case of a 17-year-old Caucasian patient who presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography evaluation revealed a unilateral ovarian lesion, 11.2 cm, with features suspicious for malignancy and torsion. The patient was referred for surgical torsion treatment and underwent unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The pathology report confirmed a serous borderline ovarian tumor with torsion. Malignant ovarian torsion in pediatric age groups is rare.

Here, we present an unusual case of heterotopic pregnancy in a 22-year-old multigravida presented to the emergency department (ED) with a clinical picture of the acute abdomen following recent abdominal trauma. Abdominal ultrasound revealed hemoperitoneum and a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at seven weeks' gestation. Following surgical exploration, the patient underwent removal of the ectopic pregnancy tissue with right salpingectomy. Since the presence of a conflicting history or equivocal physical signs and symptoms makes it difficult to diagnose heterotopic pregnancy, ED physicians and surgeons must consider the diagnosis even when dealing with viable intrauterine pregnancies. Besides, acute abdominal pain associated with shock should be regarded as suggestive of heterotopic pregnancy. Thus, prompt evaluation and a high index of suspicion are of paramount importance to prevent unwanted sequelae."

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is defined as a chronic, inflammatory, estrogen-dependent gynaecologic disease. It affects approximately 5-10% of reproductive-age women worldwide. Ovarian endometriosis is the most frequent form of this condition. Endometriotic cysts are found in about 17-44% of women diagnosed with endometriosis. It is well known, that ovarian endometriomas can cause infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Enlarging cysts can also cause ovarian torsion. In addition, ovarian endometriosis slightly increases the risk for ovarian cancer. The rupture of endometriotic ovarian cysts is an exceptional complication. According to the literature, the prevalence is less than 3% among women with endometriosis. The rupture of an ovarian endometrioma can cause acute peritonitis, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock and can be lethal. The occurrence of abscesses within an ovarian endometrioma is an extremely rare complication. Generally, the origin of infected endometriotic ovarian cysts is related to the previous invasive procedures involving pelvic organs or the use of intrauterine devices. Also, ovarian abscesses can be caused by the hematogenous or lymphatic spread of bacteria. Although, the literature points out that infection of endometriotic ovarian cysts can develop spontaneously. In these rare cases, reservoir and route of infection remains an enigma. A 49-year-old female was brought to the emergency room with severe generalized lower abdominal pain (6/10) and three days lasting fever. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse abdominal pain with anterior abdominal wall muscle tension. Painful solid masses were felt on both sides of the uterus during the pelvic examination. Cystic masses were detected in both ovaries during transvaginal sonography. Computer tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed abnormal changes in both ovaries. A small amount of free fluid was found in the pelvic cavity along with thickened pelvic peritoneum. Suspecting acute peritonitis and bilateral tubo-ovarian abscesses, surgical treatment was performed. Lower midline laparotomy with bilateral adnexectomy and abdominal lavage with 4000 ml normal saline were done. The outcome of peritonitis was evaluated using the Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI=17 - low risk of morbidity and mortality). The histopathological examination revealed the diagnosis of bilateral endometriotic cysts complicated with acute inflammation, with associated acute inflammation of both fallopian tubes. Microbiological cultures from the purulent fluid were negative. Although the occurrence of abscesses within an ovarian endometrioma is an extremely rare finding in clinical practice, it has to be considered by gynaecologists because it might result in a surgical emergency that can be life-threatening. Being aware of the risk factors of abscesses within an endometrioma can lead to an early diagnosis of this rare condition and help to avoid serious complications. Santrauka. Apžvalga.  Endometriozė yra lėtinė, recidyvuojanti, uždegiminė ginekologinė liga, nustatoma bendrosios populiacijos 5–10 proc. reprodukcinio amžiaus moterų. Dažniausia endometriozės forma yra kiaušidžių endometrioma, diagnozuojama 17–44 proc. atvejų. Dažniausios endometriozės komplikacijos yra nevaisingumas ir lėtinis dubens skausmas. Didėjančios endometrioidinės cistos gali sukelti kiaušidės apsisukimą. Be to, sergant kiaušidžių endometrioze, didėja rizika išsivystyti kiaušidžių vėžiui. Kiaušidžių endometrioidinių cistų plyšimas yra reta komplikacija, nustatoma mažiau nei 3 proc. moterų, sergančių endometrioze. Ši komplikacija gali sukelti ūminį peritonitą, sepsį, septinį šoką ar net mirtį. Mokslinėje literatūroje minima dar viena reta komplikacija – absceso formavimasis endometriomoje. Dažniausiai infekcija endometrioidinėse cistose išsivysto dėl dubens srityje atliktų invazinių procedūrų arba dėl netinkamo intrauterinių prietaisų naudojimo. Taip pat abscesų susidarymą kiaušidėse gali sukelti į endometriomą hematogeniniu arba limfogeniniu keliu patekę mikroorganizmai iš kitų organizme esančių infekcijos židinių. Mokslinės literatūros šaltiniuose yra aprašyta keletas itin retų atvejų, kai abscesas kiaušidžių endometriomoje susiformavo spontaniškai, be žinomų rizikos veiksnių, nepavykus identifikuoti infekcijos šaltinio. Atvejo aprašymas.  49 metų pacientė atvyko į skubios pagalbos skyrių dėl stipraus pilvo skausmo (6/10) ir tris dienas trunkančio subfebrilaus karščiavimo. Pilvo apčiuopos metu nustatytas viso pilvo ploto skausmingumas, jaučiami pilvaplėvės dirginimo ir priekinės pilvo sienos raumenų įtempimo simptomai. Taip pat abipus gimdos čiuopiami skausmingi, lygiu paviršiumi, vidutinio kietumo dariniai. Transvaginalinio ultragarsinio tyrimo metu dubenyje buvo matomi cistiniai dariniai abiejose kiaušidėse. Pilvo ir dubens organų kompiuterinėje tomografijoje rasta pokyčių abiejose kiaušidėse, taip pat buvo laisvo skysčio ir aiškiai infiltruota pilvaplėvė. Ginekologijos skyriuje pacientei skubos tvarka buvo atlikta apatinė išilginė laparotomija, kurios metu buvo rastas ūminis difuzinis pūlingas peritonitas ir abipusiai plyšę tuboovariniai abscesai, todėl pacientei buvo atlikta abipusė adneksektomija, kruopščiai išplauta pilvo ertmė. Operacijos metu pacientės būklė buvo įvertinta pagal Manheimo peritonito indeksą – nustatyta maža sergamumo ir mirtingumo rizika (MPI = 17). Pašalintos kiaušidės ir kiaušintakiai buvo nusiųsti histologiniam ištyrimui. Patohistologinio tyrimo metu buvo nustatytos abipusės endometrioidinės kiaušidžių cistos su ūminiu uždegimu ir ūminis abipusis kiaušintakių uždegimas. Mikrobiologiniame pasėlyje iš pūlingo pilvo ertmės skysčio bakterijų augimo nerasta. Išvados.  Kiaušidžių endometriomos infekcija yra itin retai aptinkamas reiškinys klinikinėje gydytojų akušerių-ginekologų praktikoje, tačiau svarbu mokėti šią patologiją diferencijuoti nuo kitų ūminio pilvo sindromo klinikinius simptomus sukeliančių ligų. Laiku nediagnozuoti gimdos priedų abscesai gali plyšti ir sukelti pacientės gyvybei pavojingą ūminę būklę, sepsį ar net septinį šoką. Svarbu žinoti rizikos veiksnius, galinčius sukelti abscesų formavimąsi kiaušidžių endometrioidinėse cistose, nes tai gali padėti laiku diagnozuoti šią patologiją ir išvengti sunkių komplikacijų.Raktažodžiai: infekuota endometrioma, kiaušidės abscesas, kiaušidės endometrioidinė cista, endometriozės komplikacijos."

The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Emergency Department and Inpatient Databases from five states between 2014 and 2017 were used to identify cases and assess complication rates. Incidences were calculated using population counts from the 5-year American Community Survey. Patients were identified by the presence of a diagnosis code for one of the 16 serious conditions. Only the first encounter for a given condition by a patient was included. Encounters resulting in transfer were excluded as the presence of complications was unknown. We defined complications using data elements routinely available in administrative databases including ICD-10-CM/PCS codes. The definitions were adapted from ICD-9-CM/PCS using general equivalence mappings and refined using consensus opinion. We included 16 serious conditions: appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, compartment syndrome, new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), ectopic pregnancy, empyema, encephalitis, intussusception, mastoiditis, myocarditis, orbital cellulitis, ovarian torsion, sepsis, septic arthritis, stroke, and testicular torsion. Using data from children under 18 years, we compared incidences and complication rates across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition for each condition using interrupted time series. There were 61 314 ED visits for a serious condition; the most common was appendicitis (n = 37 493). Incidence rates for each condition were not significantly different across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition for 13/16 conditions. Three differed: empyema (increased 42%), orbital cellulitis (increased 60%), and sepsis (increased 26%). Complication rates were not significantly different for each condition across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition, except appendicitis (odds ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.57-0.68), DKA (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.92-7.50), and orbital cellulitis (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.95). For most conditions, incidences and complication rates were similar before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM/PCS codes, suggesting our system identifies complications of conditions in administrative data similarly using ICD-9-CM/PCS and ICD-10-CM/PCS codes. This system may be applied to screen for cases with complications and in health services research."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is a rare, potentially life-threatening complication of an intrauterine pregnancy with a simultaneous ectopic pregnancy. There is a higher incidence with assisted reproduction techniques (ART) and radiology can be pivotal in its diagnosis. A 28-year-old woman underwent ART and at 7 weeks' gestation presented with acute right iliac fossa pain. Transvaginal ultrasound (US) imaging confirmed a viable intrauterine pregnancy. The patients' pain persisted however, and transabdominal US demonstrated a complex, heterogeneous right adnexal mass. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an HP with a ruptured ectopic and haemoperitoneum. Emergency laparoscopic surgery and right salpingo-oopherectomy were performed without complication. We highlight the importance of considering HP as a diagnosis in the acute gravid abdomen, especially when initial investigations have confirmed a viable intrauterine pregnancy. Furthermore, this case highlights MRI as a useful modality in complex cases due to its high soft tissue contrast resolution using non-ionising radiation."

A 35-year-old woman with a prior ectopic pregnancy, who reported tubal surgery of unknown location and extent, presented with a recurrent ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound imaging showed a complex cystic lesion adjacent to the ovary, moderate complex free fluid, and no intrauterine pregnancy. She underwent an urgent diagnostic laparoscopy. Chromopertubation was performed to demonstrate absence of the left fallopian tube. The ectopic pregnancy was incidentally noted to be mobile and was expelled from the right fallopian tube. Chromopertubation offers a minimally invasive technique for management of ectopic pregnancy that may reduce injury as a result of less surgical manipulation of the fallopian tube."

We evaluated differences between specialties to streamline evaluation for children with gynecological emergencies, develop a clinical pathway, and prevent care delays. A retrospective review of adolescents undergoing intervention for adnexal torsion from 2004-2018 was performed. Differences in time to intervention, operation duration, the procedure performed, and length of stay (LOS) between the specialties were analyzed. Eighty-six patients underwent 94 operations for presumed adnexal torsion with 87 positive cases. Pediatric surgeons performed 60 operations and 34 cases were performed by gynecologists. Preservation of fertility was the goal in both cohorts and the rate of oophoropexy, cystectomy, and oophorectomy were similar between the cohorts (p = 0.14, p = 1.0, p = 0.39, respectively). There was no difference in intra-operative time (p = 0.69). LOS was shorter in the gynecology cohort (median 1 day [1-2] vs. 2 days [2-3], p > 0.001). Adnexal torsion is a time-sensitive diagnosis requiring prompt intervention for ovarian or fallopian tube preservation. A multidisciplinary institutional care pathway should be developed and implemented."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Ectopic pregnancy in a non-communicating rudimentary uterine horn is a rare gynecological condition associated with a high risk of uterine rupture and important maternal mortality and morbidity. A surgical excision of the rudimentary horn is the standard treatment, usually performed by laparotomy in the second trimester. Methods: A 36-year-old woman, secundigravida and nulliparous, was admitted to the emergency obstetric unit with acute pelvic pain. The ultrasound found an ectopic pregnancy at 15 weeks gestational age with fetal cardiac activity. As her hemodynamic status was stable, a diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and confirmed the development of the pregnancy in a left rudimentary uterine horn. Results: We report a total laparoscopic removal of a pre-ruptured rudimentary uterine horn containing a second trimester ectopic pregnancy, using a vessel-sealer device. To our knowledge, only three other cases of successful laparoscopic treatment of second trimester rudimentary horn pregnancies have been reported in the literature. Conclusion: Laparoscopy is an efficient and safe surgical option for treating rudimentary horn second trimester pregnancy in patients with hemodynamic stability."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. It is usually suspected if a pregnant woman experiences any of these symptoms during the first trimester: vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal pain, and amenorrhea. An elevated BhCG level above the discriminatory zone (2000 mIU/ml) with an empty uterus on a transvaginal ultrasound is essential for confirming ectopic pregnancy diagnosis. Such pregnancy can be managed medically with methotrexate or surgically via laparoscopy or laparotomy depending on the hemodynamic stability of the patient and the size of the ectopic mass. In this case study, we report on a 38-year-old woman, G3P2+0 who presented to King Abdulaziz University Hospital's emergency department with a history of amenorrhea for three months. She was unsure of her last menstrual period and her main complaint was generalized abdominal pain. Upon examination, she was clinically unstable and her abdomen was tender on palpation and diffusely distended. Her BhCG level measured 113000 IU/ml and a bedside pelvic ultrasound showed an empty uterine cavity, as well as a live 13 weeks fetus (measured by CRL). The fetus was seen floating in the abdominal cavity and surrounded by a moderate amount of free fluid, suggestive of ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy. The patient's final diagnosis was live ruptured 13 weeks tubal ectopic pregnancy which was managed successfully through an emergency laparotomy with a salpingectomy."

On examination, she was fully conscious and hemodynamically unstable with signs of peritoneal irritation, a distended pouch of Douglas and a slightly enlarged uterus and a tender left adnexal mass. The diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was made and a laparotomy was done. Intra-operative findings were hemoperitoneum, a left ruptured BU and a dead fetus. Surgical management entailed hysterorrarphy, left salpingectomy and conservation of both ovaries. Her postoperative course was uneventful and future fertility was preserved.

Over the years, there has been a significant reduction in the mortality from this complication by improving the diagnostic tools and the treatment options. The aim of this study was to review and compare the recommendations from published guidelines on this potentially fatal condition. A descriptive review of guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on EP was carried out. All the guidelines point out the crucial role of sonography in the prompt diagnosis of EP and describe similar sonographic findings. There is a consensus on the indications and contraindications to the use of methotrexate, the post-treatment surveillance, and the criteria of expectant management. The indications for a surgical approach are not well established, although the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence agree that a laparoscopy is preferred to laparotomy for hemodynamically stable patients. The latter is considered a better option only in emergency conditions. However, there is controversy in the recommended methotrexate protocols and the evaluation of β-human chorionic gonadotrophin and progesterone levels. It is of paramount importance to build consistent international protocols, so as to help clinicians all over the world diagnose EPs in the most timely and accurate way and subsequently treat them effectively as a nonurgent medical condition, with the intention to lower the mortality and morbidity rate."

The pelvic cavity was filled with clots, and the peritoneal surface of the uterine fundus was swollen and showed continuous bleeding. The lesion was located on peritoneum and not connected with the uterine cavity. Histological examination of the conceptus showed features of a complete hydatidiform mole. After a mild decrease, hCG levels adversely increased 3 weeks later with multiple lung nodules. With a diagnosis of invasive moles, the patient was administered chemotherapy. This case demonstrates that it is important to recognize the potential of ectopic hydatidiform moles through abdominal pregnancy.

Diarrhea, constipation, and urinary tract infection are the commonest etiologies among these patients, but there are surgical emergencies, such as appendicitis and volvulus of the intestine, which are less common. Torsion of the ovary is rarer than all of the above conditions. Ovarian torsion occurs following the twisting of the ovary on its ligamentous attachment, possibly with a cyst, leading to the impediment of blood flow. Prompt diagnosis with a high clinical suspicion is essential to salvage the ovaries and to prevent complications, including death. Here, we present a case of ovarian torsion in a 2-year-old Sri Lankan girl who presented with nonspecific abdominal symptoms after being symptomatically treated twice by her general practitioners for 3 days. Following biochemical and radiological investigations, she was diagnosed with a twisted necrotic ovarian torsion and underwent laparoscopic right-sided oophorectomy. Finding the etiology of a child with abdominal pain is challenging, especially because of the limited history, examination findings, the difficulty in carrying out radiological investigations, and the poor specificity of the results compared with adults. This is a case presentation and a brief discussion about the dilemmas and difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian torsion in young children."

The rarity of this clinical condition can lead to multiple challenges. When a diagnosis is confirmed, the intervention plans should be independently tailored based on the patient's age, obstetric history, fertility wishes, as well as, surgeon's experience.

This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant effects of Nebivolol (NEB) and histopathological changes in experimental ischemic (I) and ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rat ovaries. Forty-eight adult female rats were randomly separated into six groups as group 1 (control) receiving an oral saline solution for 3 days; group 2 (I) that underwent ischemia for 3 h with the application of atraumatic vascular clips; group 3 (I/R); group 4 (I + NEB) receiving 10 mg/kg NEB by oral gavage 30 min prior to the ischemia induction; group 5 (I/R + NEB) receiving 10 mg/kg NEB, and group 6 (control + NEB) receiving oral 10 mg/kg NEB for 3 days before ischemia induction followed by consequent reperfusion. Ovarian tissue damage was scored by histopathological analysis. Ovarian tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured biochemically. The levels of MDA and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and TUNEL assay positivity scores increased in the I and I/R groups. GSH levels decreased in all case groups (P < 0.05). The oral administration of NEB (10 mg/kg) to the I- and I/R-groups reduced the levels of MDA and TNF-α and TUNEL assay immunopositivity scores (P < 0.05). GSH levels increased in the treatment groups. The current experimental ovarian torsion study suggests a protective role for NEB against I and I/R injury in rat ovaries. NEB may be a novel agent for decreasing ovarian I/R injury."

A 36-year-old Korean woman was admitted to our hospital for acute abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. She was suspected of ruptured ectopic pregnancy on the basis of a positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin test result and ultrasonographic evidence of pelvic fluid collection. During hospitalization, her symptoms deteriorated with peritoneal irritation sign on physical examination, hypotension, and tachycardia. Emergency exploratory laparoscopy was performed and revealed active bleeding from the peritoneal endometriotic deposit, which was treated with laparoscopic electrocoagulation. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Spontaneous abortion was diagnosed on the basis of decreased serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin level estimation. Although rare, gynecologists should consider endometriosis-induced hemoperitoneum with spontaneous abortion in the differential diagnosis in women of reproductive age presenting with a positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin test result and acute abdomen with intra-abdominal bleeding."

Of the 11 torsion of MCT cases, 6 of those showed abnormal elevated levels of aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT). After operation, AST/ALT levels recovered to normal ranges. Elevated liver function levels require attention to complications associated with anaesthesia and emergency operation. However, the current report shows that emergency surgery should not be delayed to assess other causes of elevated liver function tests.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Abnormal liver function tests require attention to complications associated with emergency surgery.What do the results of this study add: Our study shows that some patients with torsion of MCT returned to normal levels of AST/ALT after surgery without any medications to improve liver function.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? This study would offer that in some cases with torsion of MCT, emergency surgery should not be delayed and the assessment of other possible causes of these elevations postponed to postoperative period.

We report a case of recurrent corpus luteum hemorrhage and subsequent ovarian torsion with markedly elevated FSH levels in a reproductive-aged woman in the absence of functional gonadotroph adenoma (FGA) or premature ovarian failure (POF). A 22-year-old nulligravid woman with a history of bilateral hemorrhagic corpus luteum and subsequent ovarian torsion presented with acute abdominal pain. An emergency salpingo-oophorectomy of the right side was performed, and the right ovarian torsion due to hemorrhagic corpus luteum was diagnosed. Laboratory tests revealed markedly elevated FSH levels (77.6 mIU/mL). FGA was suspected, but no evidence of tumor was identified. The left ovary enlarged again at one-month follow-up. Estrogen/gestagen therapy (EGT) was started, which reduced the enlarged ovary to normal size. Two years later, her pituitary hormonal status was evaluated in detail. Besides markedly elevated FSH level, slightly elevated LH (31.2 mIU/mL), normal total inhibin B (35.3 pg/ml), abnormally low anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) (<0.03 ng/mL), and poor FSH response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test were found. In the absence of FGA, we conclude that certain disorders of inhibitory factors for FSH function, including inhibin and AMH may exist, which could attribute to the patient's symptoms. EGT was very effective in suppressing the ovarian hyperactivity."

    "abstract": "Paraovarian/paratubal cysts constitute about 10% of adnexal masses and are usually small and asymptomatic. A huge paratubal cyst complicated by adnexal torsion is a rare cause of acute low abdominal pain. We report the case of an obese 31-year-old nulliparous woman who presented with a large pelvic cyst causing ovarian torsion. The size of the mass (~25 cm) caused pain, and obesity led to explorative laparotomy, which showed a huge central abdominal-pelvic cyst arising from the right adnexa. Cystectomy was technically impossible, so all the adnexa was removed. Pathologic diagnosis revealed a papillary serous cystadenoma with torsion of all structures. A giant paratubal cystadenoma is a rare condition and management is challenging. If there are clinical and imaging signs of torsion, it should be approached like any other adnexal mass and surgery should be urgent in order to avoid irremediable compromise of ovarian function."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is defined as a condition when intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy occur simultaneously. It is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate and accurate diagnostics and treatment. We present a case of a 28-year-old primigravida female who conceived spontaneously and at her seventh week of gestation and was presented to the emergency department with weakness and acute pain in lower abdomen. Laboratory tests and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed the diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy. Urgent laparoscopic salpingotomy was chosen as a treatment option. The ectopic pregnancy was successfully removed with the preservation of the intrauterine embryo and fallopian tubes. The course of pregnancy after the surgery was without complications, and a healthy baby was delivered at the 39th week of gestation. When treated properly and on time, a heterotopic pregnancy can result in live childbirth with favorable outcomes for both the child and the mother."

    "title": "Laparoscopic Excision of Cesarean Scar Pregnancy with Scar Revision.",
    "abstract": "To demonstrate our technique for robot-assisted laparoscopic ectopic pregnancy excision and concomitant scar revision. We present a stepwise narrated demonstration of our primary laparoscopic technique. Although cesarean scar pregnancy is rare, it leads to life-threatening complications and often emergent hysterectomy [1,2]. Because of its rarity, there is a scarcity of centers with high-volume experience with its treatment, and no standardized diagnostic or management guidelines are yet available [3,4]. Recent evidence suggests that primary surgical management may be superior to medical or radiologic management as the latter methods carry a high reintervention rate [5]. An additional consideration in selecting a treatment method is a patient's plans for future fertility, as cesarean scar defects are associated with secondary infertility. Evidence shows that repair of cesarean scar defects decreases the likelihood of future recurrence and secondary infertility, thus it may be pertinent to select a management strategy that allows for the accomplishment of both ectopic pregnancy removal and defect revision. We present our primary laparoscopic approach to ectopic pregnancy excision and revision of the cesarean scar defect using techniques rooted in evidence and robust experience. Robot-assisted laparoscopic excision of a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy with concomitant scar revision demonstrating key strategies to minimize blood loss and preserve future fertility. (1) A laparoscopic approach allows for concomitant ectopic pregnancy removal followed by cesarean scar revision. (2) Generous use of dilute vasopressin and purposeful application of electrosurgical energy provides hemostasis without the use of more invasive measures such as vascular clips or uterine artery balloons. (3) A multilayer closure is associated with a lower risk of wedge defect formation and uterine rupture. (4) Diagnostic hysteroscopy is a useful tool for identifying the location of the scar defect, assessing for an adequate repair, and identifying potential additional uterine pathology. Primary laparoscopic management is not only the most effective method with the lowest complication rates but is an approach that allows for simultaneous repair and revision of the cesarean scar defect. We demonstrate easily adaptable techniques for maintaining hemostasis, minimizing injury to normal myometrium, and creating multilayer closures that lead to successful revisions with minimal impact to subsequent fertility."

    "abstract": "The current increase in the percentage of cesarean sections is accompanied by a significant growth in the incidence of cesarean scar pregnancies (CSP) located in the lower uterine segment, while the advancements in diagnostic ultrasound techniques have led to an increased number of CSP diagnoses. A misdiagnosed cesarean scar pregnancy, or one that is diagnosed too late, is a threat to the pregnant patient's life, and predisposes her to such complications as hemorrhage or uterine rupture, which often necessitate hysterectomy and therefore result in irreversible fertility loss. In this paper 4 cases of ectopic pregnancies located within the cesarean scar in women hospitalized at the university clinical center, within a short span of merely three months in 2018, are presented. The purpose of this paper is to indicate to doctors and gynecology and obstetric societies that there is a very urgent need for drawing up guidelines for CSP management. To this effect, information about individual cases should be gathered and analyzed thoroughly, latest reports followed, and knowledge skills and experience shared in order to be able to work out a procedure that is both effective and as safe as possible."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of an abdominal and/or pelvic ultrasound (US) performed within 24 h after a negative CT of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) in the emergency department (ED). The secondary endpoint is to assess whether there is a significant increase in length of stay (LOS) in the ED due to immediate US reimaging. We reviewed the imaging reports of 335 patients over the course of 3 years in our ED who had an US within 24 h after a negative CTAP. We then assessed type of US and whether the US showed any acute findings. We also evaluated LOS in the ED. Out of 335 patients, there were only three US cases suspicious for acute surgical pathology (3/335 or 0.9%). On 30-day clinical follow-up, only one of the three cases was confirmed as cholecystitis on pathology. The most common non-surgical findings on US not initially reported on CTAP were ovarian cysts (29/83) and gallstones (9/83). Additionally, the LOS for patients who received both a CTAP and US was 119 min longer than patients who only received a CTAP. US abdomen and/or pelvis reimaging within 24 h following a negative CTAP is unlikely to change surgical management in the acute setting. US reimaging can still be useful in diagnosing non-surgical pathology, which could serve to explain the patient's pain. US reimaging after negative CTAP is associated with an average increase in the ED LOS."

    "abstract": "Subsequent development and implantation of embryo outside the uterine lining are defined as an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies have a wide range of presentations, for example, acute hemoperitoneum to chronic ectopic pregnancy. The case presented is an unusual case of ectopic pregnancy with large hematosalpinx with classic symptoms. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this case is the largest intact tubal ectopic pregnancy reported ever in the 14th week of gestation. A 40-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain, mild dysuria, and loose motion. The patient's previous menstrual cycles were regular till four months ago, then started to be irregular, and she had no history of chronic diseases except repeated pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID). Clinically, the patient was hemodynamically stable. On palpation, the abdomen was tender, and cervical movements were not tender. BHCG in the blood came very high. The bedside point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) showed free fluid in the abdomen and a sac in the left adnexa with a living fetus (visible heartbeats). The conventional ultrasound showed 14 weeks of an extrauterine gestational sac with visible early pregnancy. Differential diagnosis was either an abdominal pregnancy versus a complicated tubal pregnancy. The surgical pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of ectopic tubal pregnancy as the tube was dilated in the middle portion containing chorionic villi, decidual reaction, and the whole gestational sac consistent with the ectopic tubal pregnancy. The patient had a successful laparotomy with salpingectomy and hemostasis and did well after the operation. So, an intact ectopic tubal pregnancy may last until the 14th week of gestation."

    "abstract": "A 43-year-old lady, gravida 2 para 0, presented to our emergency department with complaints of vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. Her urine pregnancy test was positive. She was unable to recall her last menstrual period. A trans-vaginal ultrasound revealed a pregnancy with a crown rump length of 47 mm corresponding to 11.4 weeks with no fetal heartbeat detected. She was diagnosed with a missed miscarriage and was sent for a second confirmatory scan. The repeat scan was concordant with the initial scan and she was counseled for an evacuation of uterus. Her serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin level was 45,195 IU/L and her hemoglobin level was 6.5 g/dL. She underwent an evacuation of uterus as planned, but the Hegar dilator was only able to be advanced to a cavity length of 6 cm with minimal products of conception obtained. A bedside ultrasound was performed and it showed that the Hegar dilator was in the uterine cavity but not in continuity with the gestational sac and fetus. The diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy was made and the surgery was converted to a diagnostic laparoscopy. On entry into the abdominal cavity, there was frank hemoperitoneum with adhesions limiting access to the pelvis, therefore decision was made to convert to laparotomy. The findings at laparotomy revealed a large inflamed left tubo-ovarian complex with tubal rupture and expulsion of the entire fetus and placenta into the Pouch of Douglas (POD). The diagnosis of a secondary implantation of the ectopic pregnancy in the POD after tubal rupture was confirmed and we performed adhesiolysis and left salpingectomy. The patient recovered uneventfully and the final histology showed products of conception within the lumen of the left fallopian tube in keeping with ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to evaluate our 5 years experience in diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy developing in a Caesarean section scar. The study included twenty-one women, diagnosed with a Caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP) in the first trimester, which was confirmed by ultrasound and treated in our hospital during 5 years between 2012 and 2016. The clinical presentations, imaging findings, and treatment outcomes of all these pregnancies were recorded. The main complaints of the patients were vaginal bleeding in 7 (33.3%) of cases and abdominal pain in association with vaginal bleeding in 4 (19.1%) of cases. However, the remaining 10 cases (47.6%) were asymptomatic. The number of previous Caesarean sections ranged from 1 to 4 with an average of 2.14, 24% (5/21) of our patients had only one prior Caesarean section, 43% (9/21) had 2 prior Caesarean sections, 28% (6/21) had 3 prior Caesarean sections and only 5%, (1/21) had 4 prior Caesarean sections. All our 21 cases underwent successful early first trimester diagnosis with trans-vaginal color Doppler ultrasonography. All our 21 cases showed empty uterus and empty cervical canal with visualization of gestational sac at the presumed site of the Caesarean scar; however, 13 cases showed thinned myometrium (<5 mm) between the gestational sac and bladder. The mean thickness of Caesarean section incision scar was 0.3 ± 0.15 cm. 7 cases (33.3%) showed no embryo in the gestational sac while 14 cases (66.7%) showed embryonic gestational sac, 9 cases from the 14 showed heart activity. MRI studies were done in 7 patients with Caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy to confirm the diagnosis and to follow up 2 complicated cases. In all 7 cases, the diagnosis of Caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy using MRI included empty uterine and cervical cavities, and a gestational sac seen embedded within the site of caesarean scar, with thin myometrium adjacent to the sac. No bulging of the sac through the myometrium or bladder invasion was detected. Termination of pregnancy was done by systemic methotrexate administration in 14 cases, and with trans-cervical aspiration of the gestational sac in 7 cases. Intra-operative bleeding occurred in all 7 cases treated with aspiration of the gestational sac, one of the 7 cases complicated with hysterectomy, while one patient complicated with uterine rupture and was treated conservatively. The cases treated with systemic methotrexate injection showed no complication. The Caesarean scar mass was followed with trans-vaginal ultrasound and regressed within 2 months to about 1 year post treatment. Early imaging diagnosis and effective treatment of CSEP are critically important not only to improve outcomes, minimize maternal complications and the need for emergency extended surgery, but also to maintain treatment options, and potentially preserve future fertility."

We present a case of a heterotopic pregnancy diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in a woman presenting with lower abdominal pain, who had a documented normal first trimester ultrasound the day prior to presentation. Given the increasing rates of heterotopic pregnancies, we can no longer be reassured by the presence of an intra-uterine pregnancy (IUP) in a patient with concerning signs and symptoms of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. A thorough POCUS evaluation of the uterus and adnexa is essential for the diagnosis of heterotopic pregnancy in the emergency department. This case highlights the value POCUS brings to the emergency department evaluation of patients in early pregnancy."

The most likely diagnosis was ovarian torsion, for which the patient underwent laparoscopy, detorsion and ovarian cystectomy. Histology revealed a mature cystic teratoma. Although less common than in the adult population, it is important to consider ovarian torsion in children and adolescents. Presentation is usually with pain accompanied by vomiting and fever, although these symptoms are not always present. Current management is organ-sparing, with laparoscopy±cystectomy. We discuss the adaptations for this procedure with regard to the paediatric and adolescent population. Differences in the anatomy and physiology must lead to consideration for alterations in surgical technique and positioning to ensure the safest and best quality care for these young patients."

Women with a conclusive ultrasound diagnosis of TEP had a blood test to measure β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), progesterone, inhibin A, activin A and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) at the initial visit. Women presenting with pain, serum β-hCG ≥ 1500 IU, evidence of a live ectopic pregnancy or a significant haemoperitoneum were advised to have emergency surgery. Women eligible for expectant management were followed-up prospectively until serum β-hCG declined to non-pregnant level or surgical treatment was required. A total of 93 women with a TEP were included in the final cohort. Emergency surgery was carried out in 42/93 (45 %) of women whilst 51/93 (55 %) were managed expectantly. Of the latter group, 42/51 (82 %) had successful expectant management and 9/51(18 %) required surgical procedure after a period of follow up. On multi-variable analysis, only higher values of serum β-hCG and progesterone at the initial visit were associated with a lower chance of successful expectant management of TEP. A one-unit increase in either variable on the log-scale was associated with an approximate 20-fold reduction in the odds of a successful outcome. Serum β-hCG and progesterone were significantly lower in women who had successful expectant management of TEP. Other biomarkers under consideration were not significantly different in women with successful and failed expectant management."

Clinical presentation as acute abdomen due to pain and ovarian torsion is rare, but a granulosa cell tumor must be suspected in a patient with this acute presentation and signs of early puberty. Adult-type granulosa cell tumor is an even rarer occurrence in children. CASE REPORT We report a case of torsion of adult-type granulosa cell tumor of the ovary in a 5-year-old patient with acute abdominal pain and ovarian torsion and highlight the importance of histological diagnosis of this tumor for the therapeutic plan and progression of these patients. CONCLUSIONS Precocious puberty, pain, abdominal distension, and an ultrasonography with suspicion of ovarian torsion are warning signs that may indicate the presence of a gonadal stromal tumor in pediatric patients seen at an emergency unit. These patients require long-term follow-up by a pediatrician and gynecologist because of the potential for late recurrence."

This condition originates from abnormal development of Müller's paramesonephric ducts in the early stages of embryonic development. Kidney agenesis or malformations are the most commonly associated with unilateral kidney agenesis. Ovaries may be ectopic in 16-19% of MRKHS patients. Primary amenorrhoea, due to the absence of the uterus, is the most common presentation. Female karyotype confirmation is mandatory to differentiate it from complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. The management of MRKHS is multidisciplinary in order to encompass psychological, medical and surgical issues. A four-year-old girl, presented to the emergency department complaining of left groin swelling noted 2 days earlier. The patient had recently been evaluated for an episode of acute abdominal pain and vomiting, with a final diagnosis of right ovarian torsion. At that time, the ultrasound imaging was not able to identify the left kidney, the left ovary and uterus. Surgical abdominal exploration confirmed the right ovarian torsion and was not able to identify the left kidney and the left ovary. Only a remnant of the uterus was present. Therefore, the right ovary was removed, and a diagnosis of MRKHS was made. Ultrasound imaging showed a left inguinal hernia. The hernial sac consisted of a solid oval vascularized formation suggestive of an annexe. The patient underwent a surgical procedure to correct the left inguinal hernia. In the operating setting, the presence of a vascularized, ectopic ovary carrying the tuba inside the hernial sac was observed. In front of a patient with ovarian torsion and anatomical features suggestive of MRKHS, both the ovaries should always be searched for, with a high suspicion threshold for extrapelvic ovary. Identifying the ectopic ovary, in this case, helped to preserve patient fertility, avoiding a possible torsion."

Patients underwent one of the following: expectant management, systemic methotrexate (MTX) injection, local MTX injection, combined MTX injection (local and systemic), local injection of hyperosmolar glucose, or misoprostol administration. The primary endpoint was final success defined by resolution of hCG level without need for emergency surgical treatment. Sixty-four patients diagnosed with NTEP were included: 37 (57%) had an interstitial pregnancy, 23 (35.9%) a cesarean scar pregnancy, two (3.1%) a cervical pregnancy and two (3.1%) an ovarian pregnancy. Six patients (9.4%) underwent expectant management, 24 (37.5%) a systemic MTX injection, 28 (43.8%) a local injection of MTX, three (4.7%) a combined MTX injection, one (1.6%) a local injection of hyperosmolar glucose (1.6%), and two (3.1%) were administered misoprostol. The median age was 32 years (22-45) and mean follow-up was 41 months. The final success rate overall was 92.2%: 100% for expectant management, 87.5% for systemic MTX, 96.4% for local MTX, 100% for combined injection of MTX, 100% for local injection of hyperosmolar glucose, and 50% for misoprostol. No patient required a hysterectomy. Nine (14.1%) patients required surgery, including five (7.8% (5/64)) following a rupture of the NTEP. Our results suggest that conservative medical management of NTEP is effective and safe and should be the first-line treatment for pauci-symptomatic patients with an NTEP."

Nicorandil (NIC) is an ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activator that protects the heart from ischemia. The current study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of action of NIC in ovarian ischemia-reperfusion (OIR) and possible KATP participation. Twenty-four female albino rats were classified into 4 groups: sham control, OIR, OIR + NIC, OIR + NIC+ glibenclamide (GLB) groups. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), ovarian malondialdehyde (MDA), total nitrites (NOx) contents, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were evaluated. Bax and Bcl2 mRNA were also assessed. Histological and immunohistochemical (anti-COX-2 and anti CD68) studies were done. The OIR non-treated group showed histopathological ovarian injury with decreased AMH level. Ovarian MDA, NOx, and Bax mRNA and the expression of COX-2 and CD68 were increased; however, SOD activity and Bcl2 mRNA level were decreased by OIR. NIC significantly ameliorated the histopathological ovarian injury with the restoration of AMH level. NIC significantly corrected oxidative stress and apoptotic biomarkers with decreased COX-2 and CD68 immunostaining. GLB co-administration significantly decreased the protection afforded by NIC. These results imply that NIC has a protective role against OIR via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects and such protection relies, at least partially, on the KATP channel."

In this report we present the first case reported in the literaturę of an emergency medical evacuation from a cruise ship triggered by handheld ultrasound. A point-of-care ultrasound performed by a trained cruise ship physician, reviewed by a remote telemedical consultant with experience in point-of-care ultrasound, identified an ectopic pregnancy with intraabdominal free fluid in a young female patient with abdominal pain and expedited emergent helicopter evacuation from a cruise ship to a shoreside facility, where she immediately underwent successful surgery. The case highlights a medical evacuation that was accurately triggered by utilising a handheld ultrasound and successfully directed via a tele-ultrasound consultation.

We report a series of cases of CSP and analysis of the differences in the outcomes depending on the moment of pregnancy in which they are treated. Twelve patients with a diagnosis of CSP. Seven of them were diagnosed and treated in the first trimester, often required more than one type of management, but were not transfused or presented complications. The five patients diagnosed lately in the pregnancy, always required cesarean section and emergency hysterectomy, with massive bleeding, transfusions, urinary or vascular complications. CSP can be complicated by abnormal placental invasion when pregnancy continuity is allowed. The ideal management is the termination of pregnancy shortly after the diagnosis is made. Our series highlights the diagnostic difficulties that lead to late treatment with frequent complications. It is essential to perform routine analysis of the site of implantation of the gestational sac in the first-trimester ultrasonography and the CSP suspected cases should be handled by interdisciplinary teams in experienced centers."

Uncommon adverse reactions identified included anorexia, ectopic pregnancy, exanthema, chloasma, miscarriage, and weight gain. Multiple serious adverse events, including convulsion, ectopic pregnancy, febrile neutropenia, stroke, abdominal hernia, anaphylaxis, cancer, ovarian cyst rupture, serious infections, and suicidal ideation, were reported. In addition, the prevalence of adverse events after a levonorgestrel 0.75 mg two-dose regimen and a levonorgestrel 1.5 mg single-dose regimen were not statistically different (p > 0.05). The most common adverse effects of levonorgestrel were not serious. This systematic review shows that data regarding the adverse reactions of repeated use of levonorgestrel are scarce. Studies on the multiple uses of levonorgestrel emergency contraception are still required to ensure its safety."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is an acute gynecological condition. Torsion is more likely to occur with benign rather than malignant tumors. Mature cystic teratoma of the ovary (MCTO) is frequent in women of reproductive age; however, the incidence of malignant transformation is approximately 2%. We report a case of malignant transformation of MCTO presenting as ovarian tumor torsion. A 51-year-old premenopausal woman was diagnosed with mature cystic teratoma in the left ovary 7 years ago. The patient visited our hospital because she had been experiencing of pain in left lower abdomen for the past two days. She was diagnosed with ovarian tumor torsion and underwent emergency surgery. The left ovarian tumor was twisted, and left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma arising from the MCTO. We carefully followed the patients without performing staging laparotomy. On postoperative day 112, multiple lymph node metastases in the pelvic and para-aortic areas were found by positron-emission tomography and computed tomography. After referral to a university hospital, total hysterectomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, partial omentectomy, and pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy were performed. Metastases of squamous cell carcinoma were confirmed in the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. Six courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin were given following radical surgery to prevent the recurrence of malignant transformation of MCTO. No recurrence of the disease has been observed during 2 years of follow-up. When physicians diagnose large ovarian tumor torsion cases, preoperative examinations should be performed, with the possibility of malignancy in mind."

    "abstract": "A pyosalpinx is the acute inflammation of the Fallopian tube fills up and swells with pus, which commonly results from inadequate or delayed treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease. Herein we report a case of bilateral pyosalpinx mimicking an ovarian torsion. We reported the case of a 27-year-old female patient, who presented to the emergency department with complaints of constant, worsening lower abdominal pain for 2-3 days. Pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound examinations were performed which demonstrated a large, complex cystic structure in the right adnexa with peripheral flow on color Doppler imaging. The possibilities included ovarian torsion or hemorrhagic cyst. Intraoperative findings showed bilateral pyosalpinx and treated successfully by laparoscopic bilateral salpingostomy. The present case highlights the diagnostic dilemma of bilateral pyosalpinx must be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of ovarian torsion or tumor, particularly in women of reproductive age."

    "abstract": "To report a case of cervical pregnancy (CP) treated successfully with a conservative approach, and to conduct a review of the literature regarding conservative medical and surgical treatment. Patient with cervical pregnancy treated pharmacologically with methotrexate (MTX) followed by dilation and curettage, with a satisfactory clinical course. A search of articles was conducted in Medline via PubMed, LILACS, SciElo and Google Scholar using the terms \"cervical ectopic pregnancy,\" \"conservative treatment,\" \"curettage,» \"methotrexate,\" \"uterine artery embolization,\" \"hysteroscopy.\" Reports and case series were selected of patients with cervical pregnancy diagnosed on ultrasound at any gestational age, subjected to conservative medical or surgical treatment. A total of 22 studies were included; 95 patients with CP treated with MTX were identified, 93 of them successfully treated. The most frequent complication was bleeding in 12%; 26% required complementary surgical treatment. Increasingly, uterine artery embolization (UAE) is carried out preventatively (7 cases) before curettage or treatment with MTX. The hysteroscopy is another recent alternative (20 cases). Abdominal hysterectomy was required in two cases, one of which was a cervico-isthmic pregnancy. Treatment with MTX continues to be the most frequent strategy. Dilation and curettage with endocervical plugging may be an option to consider in the emergency management of EP in primary care institutions. In institutions equipped with high complexity technology, uterine artery embolization before the surgical procedure and histeroscopy are options to be considered. Considering that early diagnosis of EP is now possible, multi-center studies comparing different management options are needed for better assessment of their safety and effectiveness. Reportar el caso de un embarazo cervical (EC) que recibió manejo conservador exitoso y realizar una revisión de la literatura sobre el tratamiento médico y quirúrgico conservador. Se presenta el caso de una paciente con embarazo cervical, quien recibió manejo farmacológico con metotrexate (MTX) y posterior legrado con evolución clínica satisfactoria. Se realizó una búsqueda de artículos en Medline vía PubMed, LILACS, SciElo y Google académico con los términos: “cervical ectopic pregnancy”, “conservative treatment”, “curettage”, “methotrexate”, “uterine artery embolization” “hysteroscopy”. Se seleccionaron reportes y series de caso, pacientes con embarazo cervical diagnosticado por ultra- sonido, de cualquier edad gestacional, sometidas tratamiento médico o quirúrgico conservador. Se incluyeron 22 estudios; se identificaron 95 pacientes con EC tratados con MTX, con tratamiento exitoso en 93. La complicación más frecuente fue la hemorragia en 12 %; el 26 % requirió tratamiento quirúrgico complementario. Cada vez más, la embolización de arterias uterinas (EAU) se realiza de manera preventiva (7 casos) antes del legrado o del tratamiento con MTX. La histeroscopia es otra alternativa reciente (20 casos). En 2 casos se requirió histerectomía abdominal, uno de los cuales fue un embarazo ístmico cervical. Conclusiones: el tratamiento con MTX sigue siendo el más frecuentemente utilizado. La dilatación y el curetaje con taponamiento endocervical puede ser una opción por considerar en el manejo de urgencia del EC en instituciones de atención primaria. En instituciones donde se dispone de tecnologías de alta complejidad, la embolización de arterias uterinas previa a los procedimientos quirúrgicos y la histeroscopia son opciones que se deben considerar.

All patients admitted to our department with the diagnosis of EP treated during the study period extending from January 2017 to June 2019. Data were collected retrospectively using the patients' files anonymously. Main outcome measures: age, parity, ectopic site, presentation, the main risk factor/s and the management plan. In total, 65 cases of EP were managed during the study period. Overall, the mean age was 30 years. EP was located in the right tube in 23 cases, and in the left tube in 14 cases. Eleven patients presented with acute abdomen due to rupture of the EP and underwent urgent laparotomy; 7 of these cases were located on the right side. Conservative surgery (laparoscopy versus laparotomy) was the main line of management with attention to preserving the tube patency, followed by medical therapy when the patient fulfilled the criteria or those with pregnancy of unknown location. EP is a life-threatening condition. It is time to reform the priorities in the conventional approach to management. Every effort ought to be applied to preserve the reproductivity of women who are diagnosed with EP at the JUH. We would suggest that salpingostomy needs to be considered the surgical treatment of choice for the majority of these cases."

    "abstract": "The aim: The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of restoration of reproductive function after surgical and medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy, taking into consideration the patency of the fallopian tubes and the incidence of uterine pregnancy. Materials and methods: A two-stage experimental approach was used to address research objectives. In the first stage, a retrospective analysis of 615 histories of patients with ectopic pregnancy has been performed. In a second stage - we examined 140 patients, which were divided into three groups, depending on the type of treatment. The first group consisted of patients with a disturbed ectopic pregnancy, who were treated with laparotomy and tubectomy. The second group included patients with exacerbated ectopic pregnancy, who were operated by laparoscopic access. Lastly, the third group comprised of women with ectopic pregnancy who were treated with methotrexate. The main source of information used for clinical and anamnestic analysis was \"medical card-patient\" (f. 003 / o). Results: The number of patients diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy increased from 2005 to 2015. In 2005 and 2006, the laparotomy operations were 86.88% and 83.33%, but conservative management only 13,16% and 16,67%, respectively. In 2015, the number of patients treated with methotrexate was more than half (51.35%) compared with 2010 and 2005 increased to 16.97% and 38.19% respectively, and laparotomy operations decreased from 86.88% in year 2005 to 18.92% in year 2015. Conclusions: The data showed that in women who underwent medical treatment with cytostatic, the patency of the fallopian tubes was significantly better than after surgical treatment. In cases of interrupted ectopic pregnancy for which laparotomy with the removal of the motor tube was applied, infertility of tubal peritoneal genesis developed in 60% of cases, which is consistent with the existing literature. Statistical analysis of the structure of ectopic pregnancy showed that in 2005 dominated interrupted ectopic pregnancy, due to late diagnostic and hospitalisation, that led to urgent laparotomy operations rather than conservative treatment."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is performed by a physician at the bedside and is standard practice in obstetric, emergency, and musculoskeletal medicine. When compared with formal sonography, POCUS is equivalent in screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm and as accurate in diagnosing deep venous thrombosis. POCUS has high accuracy for diagnosing pneumonia and detecting acute decompensated heart failure but is less accurate than computed tomography for identifying pulmonary embolism. POCUS confirmation of intrauterine pregnancy rules out an ectopic pregnancy. In the third trimester of high-risk pregnancies, umbilical artery Doppler ultrasonography can improve perinatal outcomes. Musculoskeletal POCUS is used to diagnose and guide treatment of many joint and soft tissue conditions. It is as accurate as magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of complete rotator cuff tears. Ultrasound guidance improves outcomes in the placement of central venous catheters and fluid drainage from body cavities and lumbar punctures. Ultrasonography can reduce the use of CT for diagnosis of appendicitis; however, negative scan results do not rule out disease. POCUS can accurately diagnose and rule out gallbladder pathology, and is effective for diagnosing urolithiasis. Focused cardiac ultrasonography can detect pericardial effusion and decreased systolic function, but is less accurate than lung ultrasonography at diagnosing acute heart failure. Limited evidence demonstrates a benefit of diagnosing testicular and gynecologic conditions. The American College of Emergency Physicians, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine, the American College of Radiology, and others offer POCUS training. Training standards for POCUS have been defined for residency programs but are less established for credentialing."

    "abstract": "To demonstrate the laparoscopic excision technique of a juvenile cystic adenomyoma and show how the decidualization of ectopic endometrial tissue can lead to the misdiagnosis of a focus of ectopic pregnancy. Description and step-by-step demonstration of the surgical procedure using a video recording (Canadian Task Force Classification 3). Teaching and research hospital. A 27-year-old gravida 2 parity 1 patient with one previous caesarean delivery presented to the emergency department with symptoms of pelvic pain and delayed menses. Her beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 2,161 mIU/mL. On transvaginal ultrasonography the uterine cavity appeared empty without any signs of a gestational sac, and a 42×45 mm heterogeneous mass was observed on the right cornual area. An 18×21 mm cystic area was observed within the mass. A diagnosis of cornual pregnancy was made and two doses of systemic methotrexate treatment were administered. On the 12th day following medical treatment, the patient reported increasing abdominal pain and free fluid was observed in the pouch of Douglas on ultrasonography. The decision to perform laparoscopic cornual excision was made. On laparoscopic exploration a tubal ectopic pregnancy was observed within the left fallopian tube. The presence of two simultaneous ectopic pregnancies, located in the left fallopian tube and the right cornual area, was suspected. However, upon careful inspection, the right fallopian tube appeared normal and the mass initially thought to be a right cornual pregnancy appeared more like a degenerated fibroid. A left salpingectomy was performed and the excision of the mass in the right cornual area was planned. An incision was made over the mass and the cystic inner area containing chocolate-brown colored fluid was drained. As there was no pseudo capsule surrounding the mass, the diagnosis of focal adenomyosis instead of degenerated fibroid was made. No endometriotic foci were observed within the pelvis. Different from the enucleation of a fibroid, the mass was dissected from the middle into two halves until healthy myometrium was reached on the floor of the mass. The two halves of the mass were resected totally by dissecting the adenomyotic tissue from the myometrium starting from the caudal end towards the cranial end. The first layer of the remaining myometrial defect was sutured extracorporeally with No.1 polyglactan sutures. The second and third layers were sutured intracorporeally with V-loc sutures. The resected left fallopian tube containing the ectopic pregnancy and the adenomyotic mass were externalized through a posterior colpotomy incision. The patient was discharged 24 hours postoperatively without any complications. A diagnosis of juvenile cystic adenoma was made upon histopathological examination. The patient reported subsiding of her dysmenorrhea on the postoperative third month. Juvenile cystic adenomyosis (JCA), is a rare form of focal adenomyosis which is usually located in close proximity to the uterine insertion of the round ligament, contains a cystic inner area larger than 1 cm and is encountered before the age of 30 years. Some authors reported JCA to be an accessory and cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) anomaly developing as a result of gubernaculum dysfunction. The only difference between the two conditions is reported to be the presence of a denser area of adenomyosis surrounding the cystic area lined with endometrium in JCA than in ACUM. This case has shown that decidual changes observed in ectopic endometrial tissue within an adenomyotic area may be misdiagnosed as a focus of ectopic pregnancy. Atypical endometriomas demonstrating decidual changes may also be misdiagnosed as ovarian malignancies. In non-emergency situations, waiting for the decidualization effect of ectopic endometrium to subside can help in the definitive diagnosis of such cases. Our technique for JCA excision is different from enucleation of a fibroid and may aid in the total resection and dissection of the adenomyotic tissue from healthy myometrium."

It is an emergency condition with an incidence of 2%-15% in patients with adnexal masses. The main risk in ovarian torsion is an ovarian mass or an enlarged ovary with a long pedicle. Due to the rotation of ovarian tissue axis on its vascular pedicle, there is compression of vessels followed by stromal edema, hemorrhagic infarction, and necrosis of adnexa. Expedient diagnosis poses a difficult challenge because clinical presentation is a variable and often misleading. We report a case of right ovarian torsion after oocyte retrieval for in vitro fertilization, where vaginal sildenafil citrate was successfully used to reduce ovarian edema by improving venous drainage. It also helped in maintaining ovarian tissue perfusion and preventing reperfusion injury and spontaneous detorsion of the ovary without any surgical intervention."

Animals were divided into 3 groups: the control group, the detorsion only group, and the metformin + detorsion group. The first group received only laparotomy. In the second group, ovaries were fixed to the abdominal wall after performing 360° ovarian torsion, followed by detorsion after a 3-h period of ischemia. The third group underwent the same torsion and detorsion procedures as the second group, and received 50 mg/kg metformin by gavage for 14 days. Ovarian damage scores, follicle counts, and AMH levels were evaluated. The total damage score was significantly increased in the detorsion only group compared to the metformin+detorsion and control groups. Pre-operative/post-operative AMH decreases were statistically significant in negative direction in the detorsion only group when compared to the metformin+detorsion and control groups (P = 0.001). Metformin+detorsion treatment may be effective in protecting the ovarian reserve after ovarian torsion."

It poses a significant risk to maternal life, as it is difficult to identify before surgery due to the severe hemoperitoneum in the event of rupture of the ectopic pregnancy. We report a case of a 20-year-old primigravida who presented to the emergency department of Civil Hospital Karachi, with sudden onset of generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and dizziness at 17 weeks of gestation. Emergency ultrasonography of the abdomen showed extensive echogenic fluid, which was considerably obscuring the view. An empty uterus was seen with a complex cystic mass on its right side separate from the ovary. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy was suspected, and hence, the patient was immediately shifted to the operating room. Emergency laparotomy was done which then showed ruptured ectopic pregnancy with a viable fetus in a right-sided rudimentary horn of the uterus. The horn was excised. The patient recovered well, and the postoperative course was uneventful."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a common concern in girls presenting to emergency care with pelvic or abdominal pain. The diagnosis is challenging to make accurately and quickly, relying on a combination of physical exam, history and radiologic evaluation. Failure to establish the diagnosis in a timely fashion can result in irreversible ovarian ischemia with implications for future fertility. Ultrasound is the mainstay of evaluation for ovarian torsion in the pediatric population. However, even with a high index of suspicion, imaging features are not pathognomonic. We sought to develop an algorithm to aid radiologists in diagnosing ovarian torsion using machine learning from sonographic features and to evaluate the frequency of each sonographic element. All pediatric patients treated for ovarian torsion at a quaternary pediatric hospital over an 11-year period were identified by both an internal radiology database and hospital-based International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) code review. Inclusion criteria were surgical confirmation of ovarian torsion and available imaging. Patients were excluded if the diagnosis could not be confirmed, no imaging was available for review, the ovary was not identified by imaging, or torsion involved other adnexal structures but spared the ovary. Data collection included: patient age; laterality of torsion; bilateral ovarian volumes; torsed ovarian position, i.e. whether medialized with respect to the mid-uterine line; presence or absence of Doppler signal within the torsed ovary; visualization of peripheral follicles; and presence of a mass or cyst, and free peritoneal fluid. Subsequently, we evaluated a non-torsed control cohort from April 2015 to May 2016. This cohort consisted of sequential girls and young adults presenting to the emergency department with abdominopelvic symptoms concerning for ovarian torsion but who were ultimately diagnosed otherwise. These features were then fed into supervised machine learning systems to identify and develop viable decision algorithms. We divided data into training and validation sets and assessed algorithm performance using sub-sets of the validation set. We identified 119 torsion-confirmed cases and 331 torsion-absent cases. Of the torsion-confirmed cases, significant imaging differences were evident for girls younger than 1 year; these girls were then excluded from analysis, and 99 pediatric patients older than 1 year were included in our study. Among these 99, all variables demonstrated statistically significant differences between the torsion-confirmed and torsion-absent groups with P-values <0.005. Using any single variable to identify torsion provided only modest detection performance, with areas under the curve (AUC) for medialization, peripheral follicles, and absence of Doppler flow of 0.76±0.16, 0.66±0.14 and 0.82±0.14, respectively. The best decision tree using a combination of variables yielded an AUC of 0.96±0.07 and required knowledge of the presence of intra-ovarian flow, peripheral follicles, the volume of both ovaries, and the presence of cysts or masses. Based on the largest series of pediatric ovarian torsion in the literature to date, we quantified sonographic features and used machine learning to create an algorithm to identify the presence of ovarian torsion - an algorithm that performs better than simple approaches relying on single features. Although complex combinations using multiple-interaction models provide slightly better performance, a clinically pragmatic decision tree can be employed to detect torsion, providing sensitivity levels of 95±14% and specificity of 92±2%."

The patient was severely anemic and was in hypovolemic shock at the time of presentation. She had diffused lower abdominal tenderness with hemoperitonium. After clinical and ultrasound evaluation, emergency laparotomy was decided for preop diagnosis of ruptured cornual ectopic pregnancy to rule out uterine rupture at gestational age of 16 weeks. Intraoperatively, ruptured ectopic pregnancy in noncommunicating rudimentary horn was diagnosed. Resection of rudimentary horn and ipsilateral salpingectomy was done. She was transfused with 5 units of compatible blood. It is better to increase awareness about pregnancy occurring in this rare uterine anomaly, so as to have a high index of suspicion as early detection before it gets ruptured is difficult."

    "abstract": "Acute gynaecologic disorders are commonly encountered in daily clinical practice of emergency departments (ED) and predominantly occur in reproductive-age women. Since clinical presentation may be nonspecific and physical findings are often inconclusive, imaging is required for a timely and accurate diagnosis. Although ultrasound is the ideal non-invasive first-line technique, nowadays multidetector computed tomography (CT) is extensively used in the ED, particularly when a non-gynaecologic disorder is suspected and differential diagnosis from gastrointestinal and urologic diseases is needed. As a result, CT often provides the first diagnosis of female genital emergencies. If clinical conditions and scanner availability permit, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to CT for further characterisation of gynaecologic abnormalities, due to the excellent soft-tissue contrast, intrinsic multiplanar capabilities and lack of ionising radiation.The purpose of this pictorial review is to provide radiologists with a thorough familiarity with gynaecologic emergencies by illustrating their cross-sectional imaging appearances. The present first section will review the CT and MRI findings of corpus luteum and haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, gynaecologic haemoperitoneum (from either ruptured corpus luteum or ectopic pregnancy) and adnexal torsion, with an emphasis on differential diagnosis.

Emergency department (ED) data can help provide insight on the trends of ectopic pregnancy incidence in the United States (US). Data from the largest US all-payer ED database, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide ED Sample, were used to identify trends in the annual ratio of ED ectopic pregnancy diagnoses to live births during 2006-2013, and the annual rate of diagnoses among all pregnancies during 2006-2010. Diagnoses were identified through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis and procedure codes and CPT codes. The overall ratio of weighted ED visits with an ectopic pregnancy diagnosis during 2006-2013 was 12.3 per 1000 live births. This ratio increased significantly from 2006 to 2013, from 11.0 to 13.7 ectopic pregnancies per 1000 live births, with no inflections in trend. The rate of ectopic pregnancy diagnoses per 1000 pregnancies increased during 2006-2010, from 7.0 to 8.3, with no inflections in trend. Females of all age groups experienced increases, though increases were less pronounced with increasing age. All geographic regions experienced increases, with increases being most pronounced in the Northeast. Our study suggests that ED ectopic pregnancy diagnoses may be increasing in the US, although the drivers of these increases are not clear. Our results highlight the need for national measures of total pregnancies, stratified by pertinent demographic variables, to evaluate trends in pregnancy-related conditions among key populations."

Various studies have described the outcomes depending on geographical and international diagnostic criteria. No study has been conducted in this regard from the region of Pakistan. Therefore, we aim to report the clinical features and maternal outcomes of hypothyroid pregnancies and compare the maternal outcomes between uncontrolled and controlled TSH levels in the preconception as well as the gestational period. We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study on 718 cases in the Aga Khan University Hospital after ethical approval. We collected information on pregnant females who have diagnosed hypothyroidism before conception or during their antenatal period. We noted the maternal characteristics and maternal comorbidities. Laboratory data were recorded for thyroid stimulating hormone levels before conception and during gestation. We recorded maternal outcomes as pregnancy loss (including miscarriage, stillbirth/intrauterine death, medical termination of pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy), gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, postpartum hemorrhage, placental abruption, and modalities of delivery. Data analysis was performed on Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0. Among 708 hypothyroid women 638 had live births. Postpartum hemorrhage was the most frequent maternal outcome (38.8%). The emergency cesarean section occurred in 23.4% of cases. We determined TSH levels in 53.2, 56.7, 61.7 and 66.6% of cases in preconception, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester periods. A significant association existed between cesarean section and preconception thyrotropin levels > 2.5 mIU/L, whereas postpartum hemorrhage was significantly associated with thyrotropin levels > 2.5 mIU/L in the preconception and third trimester. Successful live births in our patients were complicated by maternal postpartum hemorrhage and a frequent number of emergency cesarean section."

    "title": "Two cases of intrauterine pregnancy with tubal stump pregnancy after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer following ipsilateral salpingectomy: A case report.",
    "abstract": "The recently increased rate of heterotopic pregnancies (HPs) has been largely attributed to the increased use of assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs). HP is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. It is unusual in natural conception cycles, occurring in 1:10,000 to 1:50,000 pregnancies. However, with the increased use of ART such as in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), the incidence has risen to 0.5-1%. Case 1 was a 28-year-old woman who presented to our center complaining of a sudden onset of right-side lower abdominal pain with a small amount of vaginal bleeding. She had undergone IVF-ET and received a thawed embryo transfer with two embryos 23 days previously. She had a history of right salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy during the downregulation of her ovulatory cycle 1 year ago. Case 2 was a 25-year-old woman who presented to our center complaining of a sudden onset of right-side lower abdominal pain. She had also undergone thawed embryo transfer following IVF-ET with two embryos 35 days previously. She had a history of right salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy 1.5 years previously. Both patients were diagnosed as having a heterotopic pregnancy. Patient 1 underwent emergency laparoscopy; patient 2 underwent emergency laparotomy and both were treated medically to prevent abortion of the intrauterine pregnancies. Patient 1 had an incomplete abortion and underwent uterine curettage on the day 10 after the operation. Patient 2 experienced no further complications during pregnancy and a healthy baby girl was born at the 38th gestational week. Reproductive physicians need to pay more attention to patients who have received more than one embryo at transfer, especially those with a history of salpingectomy."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal mortality in the first trimester. It may occur in different anatomic locations with fallopian tube being the most frequent. Cesarean-scar ectopic pregnancy is one of the rarest ectopic pregnancies. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman, gravida 5 para 4, who attended the antenatal clinic after her pregnancy was confirmed by positive urine testing. She underwent transvaginal ultrasound examination which identified the gestational sac with fetal pole and cardiac activity located in the anterior part of the lower uterine segment with empty uterine cavity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan had confirmed the diagnosis of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. After through discussion on the management options, the patient was treated with intra-gestational sac injection of methotrexate. Four days after the procedure, she developed profuse vaginal bleeding and her hemoglobin showed a drop of 4.9 g/dL. She underwent emergency laparotomy with excision of the ectopic pregnancy. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications. The serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin level was undetectable on the 35th day after the methotrexate injection. Caesarean scar pregnancy is an unusual form of ectopic pregnancy. However, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for this condition as it may result in serious complications, unless promptly managed. MRI is recommended particularly when transvaginal ultrasound scan is inconclusive."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency that occurs when there is twisting or torsion of the ovary around its ligamentous supports. If left untreated, it results in loss of blood supply to the ovary and the fallopian tube with resultant infarction and loss of function. Because the presenting symptoms and signs provide a wide differential diagnosis, it can be difficult to diagnose ovarian torsion in the emergency setting. We present a case of a missed diagnosis of ovarian torsion which resulted in the loss of an ovary in a young female with bilateral large ovarian dermoid cysts."

    "abstract": "Rupture of an unscarred uterus after in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in a primiparous woman is rare. Assisted reproductive technology (ART)-induced rupture of an unscarred uterus is usually attributable to increased dizygotic twinning rates. Salpingectomy can result in cornual scarring and increase the risk of uterine rupture as well as the mortality rate in a subsequent ectopic pregnancy. Here, we present the first reported case of a spontaneous, third-trimester, uterine rupture in a primiparous woman after IVF-ET due to a history of bilateral salpingectomy because of bilateral oviduct and ovarian cysts; the patient did not have an ectopic pregnancy or any cornual or other uterine scarring during this pregnancy after IVF-ET. A 24-year-old woman with a history of IVF-ET and bilateral salpingectomy was admitted to our hospital with unexplained acute upper abdominal pain during the third trimester. The fetal heart rate was abnormal. Abdominal ultrasonography was negative. Computed tomography revealed a small amount of abdominal and pericardial effusion. Laboratory tests revealed increased white blood cells. A diagnosis of pregnancy complicated by acute abdomen was considered. Emergent exploratory laparotomy revealed a uterine rupture at the right fundus adjacent to the right cornual area. The patient was successfully managed with simultaneous exploratory laparotomy and lower-segment cesarean section. The rupture site was repaired. Two live infants were uneventfully delivered. Follow-up assessments of the mother and the female baby on the 42nd postpartum day yielded normal results. The male infant was diagnosed with left hydronephrosis and required an operation. We conclude that the ART-associated increase in dizygotic twinning rates may be a neglected risk factor for spontaneous rupture of the unscarred uterus, especially in patients who have undergone salpingectomy. Uterine rupture should be considered in a patient with multiple pregnancy following IVF-ET who presents with acute abdominal pain and abnormal fetal heart rate. Timely exploratory laparotomy is the key to a good prognosis."

Diagnosis and management can pose some difficulties especially in low-resource centers. We report a case of abdominal pregnancy with a healthy newborn. A 34-year-old Moroccan woman, G4P3 (3 alive children), presented with shortness of breath and progressive abdominal distension and pain at 37 weeks' gestation. An emergency laparotomy was performed with the impression of abdominal pregnancy. Intraoperatively, the fetus was seen in an intact amniotic sac in her abdomen, the placenta was strongly adhered to the fundus and enveloped the left adnexa. A total hysterectomy with a left adnexectomy was performed. The patient and neonate progressed well and were discharged. Term abdominal pregnancy is an extremely rare diagnosis. The life-threatening complication is bleeding from the detached placental site. High index of suspicion is vital in making prompt diagnosis in such situations."

Owing to its potentially life-threatening hemorrhage and uterine rupture, early diagnosis and management are urgently required. We present a case of a woman undergoing zigzag medical procedures, which featured non-consensus preoperative diagnosis of intramural and interstitial pregnancy and an intramural ectopic pregnancy ultimately confirmed and successfully removed by emergency laparoscopy. Additionally, we present a review of the related literature and discuss its varied clinical features, imageological characters, diagnosis, differential diagnosis and multiple treatments. A comprehensive bibliographic search through PubMed, using keywords: intramural ectopic pregnancy. Relevant literatures published from January 2013 to April 2019 were reviewed. Twenty-four cases in total for intramural ectopic pregnancy including this report were reviewed. Diagnoses were mainly made by ultrasound images. Most patients had a history of uterine surgery or intrauterine operation and had been surgically resected. None of the mothers were in danger, but only one case had live birth at 37 weeks of gestation. Non-specific clinical presentation and non-uniform ultrasound criteria pose a challenge for us to make timely and accurate management. Integrated radiological examinations and communication and cooperation between sonographers and gynecologists play a vital role in diagnostic accuracy and selecting the optimal therapeutic method of an intramural pregnancy."

Clinical symptoms were dominated by the occurrence of pelvic pain at 5-weeks of amenorrhoea. At the initial visit to the Emergency Department ß-Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) was 2134 IU/L. Preoperative diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy was suspected due to a rounded image measuring 26 mm with double echogenic crown visible on the left ovary without associated free fluid in the pouch of Douglas on ultrasound. Treatment was based on coelioscopy with resection of the ectopic chorionic villi in the left ovary. Medical treatment was based on intramuscular injection of methotrexate 1 mg/kg body weight in the immediate post-operative period because of the risk of a little residual of trophoblastic material. The diagnosis was confirmed by the histological study of the surgical specimen. The postoperative course was uneventful."

A rare case is presented of ectopic tubal pregnancy in a 28-year-old woman that presented eight years following a hysterectomy. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old woman was admitted in our hospital with moderate hypogastric pain, mild vaginal bleeding, and bilateral mastalgia. She had undergone hysterectomy eight years previously for postpartum hemorrhage. Pelvic ultrasound showed a heterogeneous tissue mass in the pelvis with peripheral vascularity that was also seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Laboratory tests showed increased serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Following hospital admission, she developed an acute abdomen and shock due to tubal rupture and an emergency salpingectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management facilitated an accurate and timely diagnosis in a rare case of ectopic pregnancy that presented eight years following hysterectomy, but could not prevent the development of potentially life-threatening complications."

The adnexa are particularly rare sites of AVM formation and the symptomatology is heterogeneous. Herein we present a case of life-threatening adnexal AVM. A 21-year-old female presented with abdominal pain and syncope, her third such presentation within 10 days. Her history was significant for ectopic pregnancy six months prior. Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed intraperitoneal blood without active bleeding. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound revealed a large amount of complicated pelvic fluid and increased right-adnexal vascularity. Interventional radiology performed an urgent uterine arteriogram revealing a right-adnexal AVM with supply from both the right uterine and right ovarian arteries. The AVM was subsequently embolized, resolving her symptoms. AVMs are exceedingly rare, often unconsidered causes of occult pelvic bleeding. Pelvic, and in particular, adnexal AVMs should be considered in females with idiopathic spontaneous hemoperitoneum."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancies are increasing in prevalence and this case highlights the importance of excluding the diagnosis in patients with pelvic pain following miscarriage. A known pre-existing intrauterine pregnancy can be falsely reassuring and delay the diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening concurrent ectopic pregnancy. In this report, we describe a case of spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy in a woman who had initially presented with pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, and was diagnosed on pelvic ultrasound with a missed miscarriage; a non-viable intrauterine pregnancy. She re-presented 7 days later with worsening pelvic pain and bleeding, and a repeat pelvic ultrasound identified a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy in addition to an incomplete miscarriage of the previously identified intrauterine pregnancy. She underwent an emergency laparoscopy where a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy was confirmed. Being a time critical diagnosis with the potential for an adverse outcome, it is important that the emergency physician considers heterotopic pregnancy as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with pelvic pain following a recent miscarriage. The same principle should apply to pelvic pain in the context of a known viable intrauterine pregnancy or recent termination of pregnancy. A combination of clinical assessment, beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels, point of care ultrasound and formal transvaginal ultrasound must be utilized together in these situations to explicitly exclude heterotopic pregnancy."

This study aims to determine the prevalence of ectopic gestation, the associated risk factors, the pattern of presentation and management of ectopic pregnancy in Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital (DASH) Lafia. This was a retrospective study of all cases of ectopic pregnancy managed at the gynaecological unit of the DASH Lafia, North-central Nigeria from 1st January, 2013 to 31st December, 2017. The data were analysed with simple descriptive statistics and were reported as frequencies and percentages. During the 5-year period, there were a total of 93 ectopic pregnancies, 10,401 deliveries and 3399 gynaecological admissions in the hospital. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy was 0.89% of all deliveries and 2.74% of all the gynaecological admissions. The majority of the patients were in the age group of 26-30 years, and significant number of the affected them were nulliparous, 30 (32.3%). Furthermore, majority of the patients had past history of sexually transmitted diseases 48 (51.6%), multiple sexual partners 40 (43.0%) and induced abortions. Abdominal pains, amenorrhoea and vaginal bleeding were the most common presenting complaints. Unilateral salpingectomy was done for majority of the patients. Ectopic pregnancy is an important gynaecological challenge associated with notable morbidity. Past history of sexually transmitted diseases, multiple sexual partners and induced abortions were the associated risk factors identified, and nulliparous women were mostly affected. This can limit their future reproductive accomplishments. Targeted health education campaigns should be embarked on to enlighten this group of women and the public at large."

While HR and SBP have traditionally been used to characterize shock in these patients, they often appear normal in the compensatory phase of shock and can be confounded by factors such as medications (eg, antihypertensives, beta-agonists). SI >1.0 has been widely found to predict increased risk of mortality and other markers of morbidity, such as need for massive transfusion protocol activation and admission to intensive care units. Recent research has aimed to study the use of SI in patients immediately on arrival to the emergency department (ED). In this review, we summarize the literature pertaining to use of SI across a variety of settings in the management of ED patients, in order to provide context for use of this measure in the triage and management of critically ill patients."

The false positive rate for sonographic diagnosis of ovarian torsion is 50%; therefore, a new real-time approach is required to improve diagnostic accuracy. We investigated diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for diagnosing ovarian torsion. Spectroscopic measurements were performed in vivo prior to, during and after detorsion. After bilateral oophorectomy, hemoxygenase and myeloperoxidase enzyme activity in ovarian tissue was evaluated and the tissues were examined for pathology. Spectroscopic data were compared to histopathological and biochemical data to assess the diagnostic value of the spectroscopic method for differentiating healthy and damaged ovarian tissue. We found a good correlation between spectroscopy and histopathology. We also found a correlation between the spectroscopic data and heme oxygenase enzyme activity. We found no correlation between the histopathological tissue damage score and myeloperoxidase enzyme activity. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy may be of prognostic and diagnostic value for ovarian torsion in vivo."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain in pregnancy represents a demanding diagnostic challenge in the emergency department (ED) due to the extensive list of differential diagnoses to be considered, coupled with the possibility of each disease having nonclassical, atypical signs and symptoms, resultant from the patient's pregnant state. Additionally, emergency physicians (EPs) face limitations on investigative imaging modalities because of the need to minimize fetal radiation exposure. EPs have to tackle this diagnostic challenge while performing a balancing act to maximize both maternal and fetal outcomes in a time-sensitive manner, becauser any delays in decision-making at the ED may threaten the safety of mother and child. Two common causes of abdominal pain in pregnancy presenting to the ED are acute appendicitis and ectopic pregnancy. The latter is almost always diagnosed by 10 weeks of gestation. Here, we report an extremely rare case of unilateral live spontaneous twin tubal ectopic pregnancy presenting past 12 weeks of gestation, diagnosed after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen. A 37-year-old gravida 2 para 1 at 12 weeks and 6 days of gestation presented to our ED with a 2-day history of right iliac fossa pain, not associated with vaginal bleeding, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. On examination, she was tachycardic (pulse rate 124 beats/min) and hypertensive (blood pressure 142/88 mm Hg). There was marked tenderness and guarding at the lower abdomen. Blood investigations were unremarkable, while abdominal ultrasonography found a live twin gestation with foetal heartbeats of 185 and 180 beats/min. MRI of the abdomen revealed an empty uterine cavity; 2 amniotic sacs and fetuses of diameter 10 cm, and a single placenta were noted in the right uterine adnexa. The patient was diagnosed with right live monochorionic diamniotic twin tubal pregnancy. Our patient underwent emergency laparoscopic right salpingectomy. The operation was successful and her postoperative care remained uneventful up to discharge. Ectopic pregnancy cannot be ruled out based on prior normal antenatal examinations and gestational age of >10 weeks. EPs should not hesitate to order MRI scans for further evaluation if ultrasonography and laboratory findings are equivocal."

Surgical etiologies in patients younger than 2 years of age include intussusception, pyloric stenosis, malrotation and midgut volvulus. In older patients, considerations become closer to differential etiologies in adults including acute appendicitis. Ultrasound and fluoroscopic examinations remain the mainstay for diagnosis that may even be therapeutic such as contrast/air enemas in intussusception reduction. There is an increasing role for CT in appendicitis and renal colic especially in assessing complications; however, it is less favored because it incurs radiation to the patient. This article summarizes the imaging approach to pediatric patients with acute abdominal pathologies presenting to the emergency department, and how imaging is instrumental in guiding diagnosis and treatment, with emphasis on radiation safety, in the context of providing typical imaging findings of each pathology in this pictorial review."

The ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol was created by the authors to aid in the evaluation of acute abdominal pain using a systematic sonographic approach, integrating the same core ultrasound techniques already in use-into one mnemonic. This mnemonic ACUTE means: A: abdominal aortic aneurysm; C: collapsed inferior vena cava; U: ulcer (perforated viscus); T: trauma (free fluid); E: ectopic pregnancy, followed by ABDOMEN which stands: A: appendicitis; B: biliary tract; D: distended bowel loop; O: obstructive uropathy; Men: testicular torsion/Women: ovarian torsion. The article discusses two cases of abdominal pain the diagnosis and management of which were directed and expedited as a result of using the ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol. The first case was of a 33-year-old male, who presented with a 3-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation. Physical exam revealed a soft abdomen with generalized tenderness and normal bowel sounds. Laboratory tests were normal. A bedside ultrasound done using the ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol showed signs of intussusception. This was confirmed by CT-abdomen. The second case was of a 70-year-old female, a known case of diabetes and hypertension, who presented with a 3-hour history of abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. She had a normal physical exam and laboratory studies. Her symptoms mimicking simple gastroenteritis had improved. However, bedside ultrasound, using the ACUTE-ABDOMEN protocol showed localized free fluid with dilated small bowel loop in right lower quadrant with absent peristalsis. A CT abdomen confirmed a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. These two cases demonstrate that the usefulness of applying POCUS in a systematic method-like the \"ACUTE-ABDOMEN\" approach-can aid in patient diagnosis and management. We are presenting two cases of undifferentiated acute abdomen pain, where ACUTE ABDOMEN sonographic approach was applied and facilitated the accurate patient management and disposition. ACUTE ABDOMEN sonographic approach in acute abdomen can play an important role in ruling out critical diagnosis, and can guide emergency physician or any critical care physician in patient management."

It was previously suggested that stored blood provides inadequate volumes compared to what is needed. Minimal data are available regarding indications for emergency blood usage. We aimed to describe the utilisation of emergency blood in selected Cape Town emergency centres. A cross-sectional study was carried out at three secondary level emergency centres (no blood bank), and one tertiary centre (with a blood bank). Data from emergency blood recipients were recorded over a three-month study period. Indications for transfusion, number of units and location of transfusion were recorded. Indications and usage location were described in numbers and proportions. A total of 329 emergency blood units were transfused to 210 patients. Trauma accounted for 39% (n = 81) of cases and other surgical conditions for 22% (n = 47), particularly upper gastrointestinal 11% (n = 24) and perioperative bleeding 8% (n = 16). Medical conditions accounted for 15% (n = 31), with anaemia 13% (n = 27), the most prevalent indication. Gynaecological conditions accounted for 15% (n = 32), mostly ectopic pregnancy 8% (n = 17). The majority of emergency blood, 77% (n = 253) were used in the emergency centres or operating theatres, 6% (n = 21). Trauma remains a major indication for emergency blood transfusion in this setting. This study questions the use of emergency blood for certain non-urgent diagnoses (i.e. anaemia). Given the scarcity of this resource and limitations to access, appropriate use of emergency blood needs to be better defined locally. Ongoing monitoring of the indications for which emergency blood is used, improved transfusion stewardship and better systems to access emergency blood should be a priority in this setting."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences and perceptions of care of women treated for early pregnancy complications in a Canadian emergency department (ED) and early pregnancy clinic (EPC). We conducted a descriptive qualitative study to understand the perceptions, meanings, and perspectives of women of 18 years and older who presented to the ED or EPC of an urban, tertiary care hospital with early pregnancy complications or loss. Using a semi-structured interview guide, a 45- to 60-minute telephone interview was conducted by a trained qualitative interviewer at 4 to 6 weeks after the ED visit. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Data analysis occurred in conjunction with data collection in order to continuously monitor emerging themes and general areas for further exploration. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation had occurred. Interviews were completed with 30 women between June and August 2018. Three key themes arose: disconnect of the ED's role in the provision of care, normalization of a chaotic healthcare experience, and finding connection through the institution's EPC. Perspectives of women with early pregnancy complications highlight the ways in which ED care often does not meet the expectations or needs of patients and their families. The emotional complexity of this medical situation is often overlooked by ED staff and can produce encounters that are distressing. However, negative experiences were often mitigated by follow-up care in the institution's EPC. L’étude qualitative portait sur l'expérience vécue par des femmes traitées pour des complications en début de grossesse dans un service des urgences (SU) au Canada ou dans une clinique spécialisée dans la prise en charge des troubles du début de la grossesse, ainsi que sur leur impression des soins reçus. Il s'agit d'une étude qualitative et descriptive visant à connaître l'impression que des femmes âgées de 18 ans et plus avaient des soins reçus dans un SU d'un centre hospitalier de soins tertiaires situé en milieu urbain pour des complications en début de grossesse ou un avortement, ou dans une clinique spécialisée en la matière; à cet élément s'ajoutent la portée de l'expérience vécue et le point de vue des participantes.

Les entretiens ont tous été enregistrés sous forme numérique et transcrits textuellement aux fins d'analyse. La collecte de données ainsi que l'analyse des donnés se sont déroulées en parallèle afin de permettre un suivi continu de l’émergence de nouveaux thèmes ou d’éléments généraux nécessitant un examen approfondi. Les entretiens se sont poursuivis jusqu’à l'atteinte du point de saturation thématique. Trente femmes ont participé à l’étude, entre juin et août 2018. Trois grands thèmes se sont dégagés des entretiens, soit le manque d'empathie du personnel au SU, la normalisation d'une prestation chaotique des soins de santé et, en revanche, le sentiment de compréhension ressenti à la clinique spécialisée, rattachée à l’établissement. Le point de vue des femmes ayant vécu des complications en début de grossesse met en lumière le fait que souvent la prestation des soins au SU ne répond pas aux besoins et aux attentes des patientes et de leur famille. La complexité de la charge émotive liée au problème médical est bien des fois négligée par le personnel au SU, ce qui peut donner lieu à des situations pénibles. Toutefois, l'expérience défavorable vécue par les femmes est souvent atténuée par le suivi assuré à la clinique spécialisée, rattachée à l’établissement."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that can be difficult to diagnose and can therefore lead to delayed treatment and loss of ovarian function. While the diagnosis of ovarian torsion is based clinically, several sonographic findings can suggest ovarian torsion, including an enlarged ovary, presence of an ovarian cyst or mass, or abnormal ovarian blood flow. Less commonly described is the finding of an abnormal ovarian location in a clinical setting concerning for torsion. We present three cases of ovarian torsion where an ultrasonographic finding of a \"double bladder sign\" aided in early detection of ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography (USG) is the first and best modality for diagnosis of the adnexal torsion. But frequently in clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) scan becomes the first acquired modality as adnexal torsion mimics other non-gynaecological conditions. This retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic performance of CT as a modality in adnexal torsion. Thirty cases of surgically proven adnexal torsion with preoperative CT scans were included. Changes in the ovary, fallopian tube, uterine axis and other features were documented and analysed. At least one positive CT sign was seen in all 30 adnexal torsion patients. Twisted pedicle was seen in 100% cases. Peripherally displaced follicles in 57.1%, associated mass in 93.3%, ovarian hyperdensity in 46.4%, hydrosalpinx in 46.7%, change in uterine axis in 43.4% and ascites in 73.3%. CT of the pelvis can diagnose ovarian torsion when the described signs are carefully looked for.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Adnexal torsion is an surgical emergency where delayed diagnosis may reduce the ovarian salvageability rate. USG has been a trusted modality for imaging the adnexa and associated pathologies such as torsion. It is a general assumption that CT is not an apt modality for diagnosis of torsion.What the results of this study add? The results of this study emphasise that CT can be used to diagnose adnexal torsion when the signs described are carefully looked for. A normal appearing ovary on CT can rule out torsion as at least one sign will be positive in such cases.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? As adnexal torsion clinically mimics non-gynaecological conditions such as ureteric colic, appendicitis, etc. where CT is the initial and only available modality, applying the results of our study can aid in diagnosis of adnexal torsion on CT itself, prompting immediate surgical referral and thereby reducing the delay by not acquiring or confirming by another modality such as USG."

As trophoblastic invasion of the myometrium can result in uterine rupture and catastrophic hemorrhage termination of pregnancy is the treatment of choice if diagnosed in the first trimester. Expectant treatment has a poor prognosis and may lead to uterine rupture which may require hysterectomy and subsequent loss of fertility. We present a case report of a 24-year-old female G2P1L1with ruptured cesarean scar pregnancy who underwent emergency laparotomy and subsequently hysterectomy. In this case report, we aim to discuss ruptured cesarean scar pregnancy as obstetric emergency and methods by which we can make an early diagnosis that it can be managed appropriately so as to prevent maternal morbidity and mortality.

Association between ectopic pregnancy and LNG-EC was assessed using Pearson chi-square test. The relationship between outcome and exposure (while adjusting for confounders) was assessed using logistic regression model. The mean age was 27.15 years. Both cases and controls were similar by age (p = 0.990), educational level (p = 0.850), marital status (p = 0.559), employment status (p = 0.186) and parity (p = 0.999). Seventy-eight (24.7%) participants had a history of miscarriage. A higher proportion of the cases had history of using LNG-EC compared to the controls (32.9% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001). The use of LNG-EC portended more than nine times increased odds of ectopic pregnancy compared to other contraceptive methods {OR = 9.34 (95% CI: 3.9 - 16.0)}. levonorgestrel only emergency contraceptive use was associated with ectopic pregnancy. One of the limitations of this study is that we could not control for all confounders of ectopic pregnancy."

We studied patients under age 18 years using 3 data years from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Statewide Databases of Maryland and New York. We measured complications by condition. Resource utilization was compared between patients with and without complications, including hospital length of stay, and charges. We analyzed 27 087 emergency department visits for a serious condition. The most common was appendicitis (n = 16 794), with 24.3% of cases complicated by 1 or more of perforation (24.1%), abscess drainage (2.8%), bowel resection (0.3%), or sepsis (0.9%). Sepsis had the highest mortality (5.0%). Children with complications had higher resource utilization: condition-specific length of stay was longer when complications were present, except ovarian and testicular torsion. Hospital charges were higher among children with complications (P < .05) for 15 of 16 conditions, with a difference in medians from $3108 (testicular torsion) to $13 7694 (stroke).

Pregnant women diagnosed with threatened abortion experience and their spouses severe anxiety and stress due to the probability of the pregnancy ending. Couples having difficulty coping with the see motions need support systems. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the anxiety levels experienced by couples who present at the emergency department with a complaint of vaginal bleeding and are diagnosed with threatened abortion, as well as their support systems. The study was conducted with 276 participants (138 pregnant women and their spouses) admitted to the obstetrics emergency department of an obstetrics and paediatrics hospital in Turkey between December 2014 and March 2015. Data were collected through a demographic information form developed by the researcher, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). There were significant negative associations between mean the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support scores of the pregnant women and their spouses (p < 0.05). The couples' anxiety levels did not significantly differ according to whether they received support from each other and from emergency nurses (p > 0.05). It was found that both state and trait anxiety levels of the couples decreased as perceived social support increased. However, it was determined that the support couples received from each other and from emergency nurses was not sufficient in terms of reducing anxiety."

    "abstract": "The pediatric reproductive organs are optimally imaged with a full bladder. The filling of the bladder, however, often leads to significant delay in diagnosis and can subject the patient to invasive bladder catheterization. As the key imaging feature in ovarian torsion is unilateral ovarian enlargement, we suspected that a torsed ovary is large enough to be visualized even if the bladder is not well distended. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate if clinically suspected adnexal torsion can be excluded based on non-visualization of the ovaries on transabdominal ultrasound (US) with a non-distended bladder in pediatric patients. This retrospective study comprised 349 girls (1-19 years old) between Jan. 1, 2013, and July 30, 2018. Three hundred and forty-one of the girls were referred to transabdominal US to assess for adnexal torsion and/or appendicitis, and the ovaries were initially not visualized on US. Their bladders were subsequently filled and rescanned with a distended bladder showing the ovaries. Ovarian volumes and time between US scans were documented. The ratio of the volume of the larger ovary to the smaller one was calculated. Nine girls had surgically proven adnexal torsion and a preoperative transabdominal US with a non-distended bladder. There was an overlap of one girl between the two groups. The negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and sensitivity and specificity for exclusion of adnexal torsion based on non-visualization of the ovaries on US with a non-distended bladder were calculated. One of the girls (1/341) who had a US study done with a non-distended bladder in which the ovaries were not visualized had a positive diagnosis of adnexal torsion. In eight of the nine girls who had surgically proven adnexal torsion, the torted ovary was identified with a non-distended bladder. The NPV and PPV for exclusion of adnexal torsion with a non-distended bladder was 1.0 and 0.8, respectively. The specificity and sensitivity were 99.4% and 88.9%, respectively. The mean and median time difference between the initial scan and the scan after bladder filling was 105.1 min (standard deviation [SD] -65.8) and 89.0 min (interquartile range [IQR]- 59.0, 130.5), respectively. Non-visualization of the ovaries with a non-distended bladder on transabdominal US study can help exclude clinically suspected adnexal torsion, alleviating the need for bladder filling and prolonging the wait time in the emergency department. Inclusion of non-visualization of the ovaries as one of the features in a predictive score for adnexal torsion should be considered."

The patient was taken to the operating room for resection, given the size of the pregnancy, concern for intraoperative blood loss, concern for persistent pregnancy, and concern that patient would not be able to reliably follow up for multiple appointments. Patient underwent laparoscopic resection of a large cornual ectopic pregnancy. Included is a short review of laparoscopic suturing techniques. Pathology, decline in beta hCG, and post-operative course. The patient's pathology was confirmatory for cornual ectopic pregnancy. Her beta human chorionic gonadotropin decreased as expected, and she had a normal post-operative course. Laparoscopic cornual resection is a safe and effective method for management of large cornual ectopic pregnancy, and fertility outcomes are similar to patients after salpingectomy for non-interstitial ectopic pregnancy."

Establishing the precise diagnosis of pregnancy location is key for appropriate management of early pregnancies, and experts are usually able to locate a pregnancy in the first scan. A decision-support system based on a semantic, expert-validated knowledge base may improve the diagnostic performance of nonexpert examiners for early pregnancy transvaginal ultrasound. This study aims to evaluate a novel Intelligent Scan Assistant System for early pregnancy ultrasound to diagnose the pregnancy location and determine the image quality. Two trainees performed virtual transvaginal ultrasound examinations of early pregnancy cases with and without the system. The ultrasound images and reports were blindly reviewed by two experts using scoring methods. A diagnosis of pregnancy location and ultrasound image quality were compared between scans performed with and without the system. Each trainee performed a virtual vaginal examination for all 32 cases with and without use of the system. The analysis of the 128 resulting scans showed higher quality of the images (quality score: +23%; P<.001), less images per scan (4.6 vs 6.3 [without the CDSS]; P<.001), and higher confidence in reporting conclusions (trust score: +20%; P<.001) with use of the system. Further, use of the system cost an additional 8 minutes per scan. We observed a correct diagnosis of pregnancy location in 39 (61%) and 52 (81%) of 64 scans in the nonassisted mode and assisted mode, respectively. Additionally, an exact diagnosis (with precise ectopic location) was made in 30 (47%) and 49 (73%) of the 64 scans without and with use of the system, respectively. These differences in diagnostic performance (+20% for correct location diagnosis and +30% for exact diagnosis) were both statistically significant (P=.002 and P<.001, respectively). The Intelligent Scan Assistant System is based on an expert-validated knowledge base and demonstrates significant improvement in early pregnancy scanning, both in diagnostic performance (pregnancy location and precise diagnosis) and scan quality (selection of images, confidence, and image quality)."

Because of the paucity of data, little guidance for the appropriate management of a twin tubal ectopic pregnancy is available. Case Report: A 40-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of vaginal bleeding associated with lower abdominal pain. The patient was hemodynamically stable with signs of an acute abdomen. Pelvic examination elicited clinical findings consistent with potential ectopic pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test in the ED was positive. Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin was 23,359 mIU/mL, and transvaginal ultrasound showed findings concerning for a twin ectopic pregnancy. Diagnostic laparoscopy with right salpingostomy was successful, and the patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Conclusion: Healthcare providers should have a high index of clinical suspicion for ectopic pregnancies. Unilateral tubal twin ectopic pregnancies, while rare, can be adequately diagnosed with transvaginal ultrasound. Laparoscopic salpingostomy provides conservative and successful treatment of unilateral tubal twin gestation with short recovery time. Medical treatment with methotrexate has not been adequately studied in this clinical scenario, but further exploration of this management modality should be considered."

The primary objective of this study was to explore the services available (ED management, ultrasound access, and follow-up care) for ED patients experiencing early pregnancy loss or threatened early pregnancy loss in Ontario hospitals. The emergency medicine chiefs of 71 Ontario hospital EDs with an annual census of more than 30,000 ED patient visits in 2017 were invited to complete a 30-item, online questionnaire using modified Dillman methodology. Respondents from 63 EDs across Ontario completed the survey (response rate 88.7%). Of the EDs surveyed, 34 (54.0%) reported that they did not have access to early pregnancy clinic services for women who presented to the ED with early pregnancy complications that were safe to discharge home. At these hospitals, it was found that patients were followed up in 14 (41.2%) EDs for the same complications, including pregnancy of unknown location and threatened abortion. Respondents also stated that a radiologist-interpreted ultrasound was available to only 22 (34.9%) of hospital sites for 24 hours, 7 days per week for women with early pregnancy complications. The results of this study highlight the reliance of some hospitals on the ED to provide ongoing follow-up care to patients experiencing complications of early pregnancy. The lack of clinical resources and specialized personnel in Ontario hospital EDs makes supporting these women longitudinally unrealistic, exposing them to undue risk and complications. Les femmes qui présentent des complications en début de grossesse consultent souvent au service des urgences (SU), la plupart d'entre elles n'ayant pas encore de plan de soins déjà établi par un professionnel de la santé en obstétrique. L’étude avait pour objectif principal de relever les services (prise en charge au SU, échographie, suivi) auxquels les femmes ayant fait un avortement spontané ou étant en état de menace d'avortement en début de grossesse avaient accès au SU, dans les hôpitaux, en Ontario. Les chefs des services de médecine d'urgence de 71 hôpitaux, en Ontario, ayant reçu plus de 30 000 patients en 2017 ont été invités à répondre à un questionnaire en ligne, composé de 30 éléments et envoyé selon une version modifiée de la méthode de Dillman. Les chefs de 63 SU, de partout en Ontario, ont rempli le questionnaire (taux de réponse : 88,7%). Sur ce nombre, 34 (54,0%) ont indiqué ne pas pouvoir offrir des services cliniques de début de grossesse aux femmes consultant au SU pour des complications gravidiques précoces, et jugées en état de retourner à domicile. D'après l'enquête, les femmes étaient suivies pour ces mêmes complications, notamment des grossesses de siège inconnu ou des menaces d'avortement, dans 14 SU (41,2%) de ces hôpitaux. De plus, les femmes connaissant des complications en début de grossesse ne pouvaient profiter de services d'interprétation d’échographies par des radiologistes, 24 heures sur 24, 7 jours sur 7, que dans 22 des hôpitaux participants (34,9%). Les résultats de l’étude font ressortir la confiance que mettent certains hôpitaux dans les SU pour offrir un suivi continu aux femmes souffrant de complications en début de grossesse. Le manque de ressources cliniques et de personnel spécialisé dans les SU, en Ontario, rend irréaliste le suivi longitudinal de ces femmes et, de ce fait, les expose à des risques indus et à des complications."

Common clinical features include vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain; however, a significant proportion of cases are asymptomatic. The primary diagnostic modality is transvaginal ultrasound. There is no current consensus on best-practice management. A 36-year-old woman, G7P2, presented to an early-pregnancy service with vaginal spotting and an ultrasound scan demonstrating a live caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy at 8 + 5 weeks' gestation. On examination she was hemodynamically stable with a soft abdomen. She was advised to have dilation and curettage (D&C) under ultrasound guidance; however, she was concerned that she might require more extensive surgery, such as a hysterectomy and so requested non-surgical management. On day 1 she underwent ultrasound-guided embryocide with lignocaine followed by inpatient multi-dose systemic methotrexate. Her beta-human gonadotrophic hormone level decreased. Repeat ultrasound on day 18 demonstrated a persistent caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy with increased vascularity, and so uterine artery embolization (UAE) was performed with a view to D&C the following day. This plan was altered to expectant management with ongoing follow-up by a different clinician who had had previous success with UAE alone. On day 35 the patient presented with life-threatening vaginal bleeding that required an emergency total abdominal hysterectomy. Caesarean scar pregnancies are uncommon. Multiple treatment strategies have been employed, with variable degrees of success. Further research into risk stratification and management are needed to guide clinician and patient decision making."

Although rare, hemoperitoneum following rupture of corpus luteum in early pregnancy should always be considered in the diagnostic process. We present a patient that was admitted to our department with amenorrhea, positive ßhCG and acute abdomen. Emergency laparoscopy was performed but no ectopic pregnancy was found, just blood, coagula and a ruptured corpus luteum. The day after the surgery, intrauterine pregnancy was found on ultrasound and the pregnancy ended with term delivery."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy following hysterectomy is very rare and may lead to significant morbidity, especially when diagnosis is delayed. A 32-year-old G3P3002 African woman presented with increasing abdominal distension and 1 day of worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. Her previous pregnancy had ended 6 years prior with a stillborn baby delivered by Cesarean hysterectomy after laboring at home for 1 day. At the time of current presentation, this patient was confused and irritable, with an undetectable blood pressure, tachycardia, labored breathing, and a distended and tender abdomen. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was positive and a transabdominal ultrasound showed significant intraperitoneal fluid collections and a singleton, viable pregnancy consistent with 13 weeks of gestation. A diagnosis of hypovolemic shock secondary to ruptured ectopic pregnancy was made, and she underwent emergency laparotomy. Intraoperative findings included 4.5 liters of hemoperitoneum and a cervical stump pregnancy with active bleeding from a partially detached placental site. Any reproductive-aged woman with at least one ovary and a means for sperm to meet egg should be screened for pregnancy if she presents with an acute abdomen or abdominal or pelvic pain."

    "abstract": "When a woman with an endometrioma presents with acute abdominal pain, it is unclear whether ovarian torsion should be suspected. To compare patient characteristics, imaging results, and surgical management of endometriomas in elective versus emergent surgeries. This retrospective cohort study included women treated at our institution during the period 1990-2015 who presented with histologically verified endometrioma and who underwent either planned surgery or emergent surgery due to suspected adnexal torsion. Of 225 surgeries performed, 174 were elective and 51 emergent. Patients in the emergent group were significantly younger (33.9 ± 11.1 vs. 39.01 ± 10.9 years, P = 0.004). Abdominal pain was the main complaint of all the emergent surgery patients and the leading complaint in 21% of the elective surgery patients (P < 0.001), with right-sided predominance in both groups. Sonographic parameters were similar in both groups. Bilateral ovarian cysts were noted in 11.7% and 11.0% of emergent and elective patients, respectively (P = 0.87). Laboratory evaluation was notable for a higher white blood cell count and CA125 levels among emergent patients. All patients in the emergent group and 93% of patients in the elective group were managed laparoscopically. No cases of torsion were noted. The rate of intra-pelvic adhesions was similar in both groups (56.8% vs. 66.6%, P = 0.19). Endometrioma may present with acute abdominal pain. However, adnexal torsion in these patients is rare. These cases can be managed using a minimally invasive approach, assuming an optimal surgical setting."

Multiple studies have suggested that PPOCUS may decrease length of stay (LOS) for emergency department (ED) patients presenting with early symptomatic pregnancy compared to comprehensive ultrasound (CUS). This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the association between the use of PPOCUS vs CUS and ED LOS. A systematic review of the literature was performed. Patients with symptomatic early pregnancy receiving EP-performed PPOCUS were compared to patients receiving CUS without PPOCUS. Keywords and search terms were generated for PPOCUS, ED LOS and CUS. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts for inclusion. A third reviewer was used when conflicts arose to gain consensus. Formal bias assessment was performed on included studies. Meta-analysis was carried out, pooling the mean differences between studies using a random-effects model. 2980 initial articles were screened, 32 articles underwent detailed review, 8 underwent bias assessment, and 6 were included in the final meta-analysis. There were 836 patients in the study group and 1514 in the control group. All studies showed a decreased LOS in the PPOCUS group with a mean decrease of 73.8 min (95% CI 49.1, 98.6). Two studies not included in the meta-analysis also showed significantly decreased LOS with PPOCUS. Use of PPOCUS in the evaluation of patients with symptomatic early pregnancy is associated with decreased LOS in patients ultimately diagnosed with intrauterine pregnancy. This review suggests that this finding is generalizable to a variety of practice settings."

    "abstract": "To assess the overall accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) for diagnosis of all types of extrauterine ectopic pregnancy (EUEP) in a large group of women who were managed surgically. We also aimed to assess the positive predictive value (PPV) of TVS for each of the different ultrasound morphological types of EUEP. This was a retrospective observational study of all pregnant women who underwent emergency surgery following ultrasound diagnosis of EUEP at a single early pregnancy unit between January 2009 and December 2017. The preoperative TVS findings were recorded, including the exact location and morphological type (Type I-V; defined using ultrasound criteria) of EUEP. TVS findings were compared with operative and histological findings. The performance of ultrasound in diagnosing EUEP overall and according to morphological type was assessed, using visual confirmation of ectopic pregnancy at surgery as the reference standard. A total of 26 401 women presented with early-pregnancy complications during the study period, including 1241 (4.7%; 95% CI, 4.5-5.0%) women with a conclusive diagnosis of EUEP on TVS or a presumed diagnosis based on severe pain and significant hemoperitoneum. Surgery was performed in 721/1241 (58.1%; 95% CI, 55.3-60.8%) cases, of which 710 (98.5%; 95% CI, 97.6-99.4%) had a conclusive diagnosis of EUEP on preoperative TVS. The remaining 11 women had severe pain and significant hemoperitoneum and were managed surgically on clinical grounds as an emergency, without an ectopic pregnancy having been identified on ultrasound examination. At laparoscopy, the diagnosis of EUEP was confirmed in 706/710 (99.4%; 95% CI, 98.6-99.8%) women with a positive ultrasound diagnosis and in all 11 women with a presumed ultrasound diagnosis of EUEP. The PPV of preoperative ultrasound for the diagnosis of EUEP was 99.4% (95% CI, 98.6-99.8%) with sensitivity of 98.5% (95% CI, 97.3-99.1%). There was no statistically significant difference in the accuracy of preoperative ultrasound diagnosis between the five morphological types (P = 0.76). The accuracy of preoperative ultrasound for diagnosis of EUEP is high. The morphological type of EUEP on TVS had no significant effect on the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis.

This observational monocentric study took place from November 2009 to December 2015 in the emergency unit at La Conception University Hospital in Marseille, France. 440 women were treated by methotrexate for tubal ectopic pregnancy. Women were assigned in a classic follow up protocol with a weekly hCG evaluation (conventional protocol) if the drop in hCG between D1 and D4 was inferior to 20% or in an alternative follow up (streamlined protocol) with a hCG evaluation at one month. The main outcome measures were the success rate, the proportion of women requiring several methotrexate injections, and the mean number of consultations per women and duration of the follow-up. During this period, the success rate was 348/440 (79.1%). The rate of women requiring 1, 2, or 3 injections and of women lost to follow-up were comparable between the two protocols. The mean number of consultations per woman was 3.6 ± 1.33 vs. 5.95 ± 2.25 days (p < 0.0001), and the follow-up was 27.5 ± 12 vs. 28.1 ± 15.4 (p = 0.6) respectively in the conventional protocol group and the streamlined. Our customized strategy allows for a decrease in the number of consultations per woman without changing the success rate or the need for methotrexate injection. hCG count drop between D1 and D4 allows for the selection of a low-risk group that can benefit from appropriate aftercare."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes of conservative treatments for cervical ectopic pregnancy (CEP). MATERIAL AND METHODS The series of CEP cases at our hospital between 2009 and 2016 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were treated using systemic methotrexate infusion (MTX group, n=9), angiographic uterine artery embolization (UAE group, n=11), or transcatheter intra-artery methotrexate infusion combined with UAE (UAE+MTX group, n=13). Clinical outcomes, complications, and fertility were evaluated. RESULTS The median serum β-hCG was 6449 mIU/mL for MTX group, 17384 mIU/mL for UAE group, and 21361 mIU/mL for UAE+MTX group. The difference was statistically significant. In the MTX group, 1 patient developed hepatotoxicity and 2 patients occurred continuous vaginal bleeding during curettage. These 3 patients were successfully treated with emergency UAE. In the UAE group, 2 patients had vaginal re-bleeding on postoperative day 17 and 26, respectively, and received a second UAE procedure. In the UAE+MTX group, no patients developed severe complications. Moreover, a quick regression of serum β-hCG level, shortened recovery of normal menstruation, rapid cervical mass elimination, and a short hospital stay were observed in patients of the UAE+MTX group. CONCLUSIONS The triple therapy of transcatheter intra-arterial methotrexate infusion combined with UAE followed by immediate curettage is feasible and advantageous in treating CEP."

    "abstract": "An advanced second trimester tubal pregnancy is rarely encountered because almost all ecopic pregnancy are diagnosed at an early stage. Transvaginal sonography is simple and useful for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy. However, diagnosing the site of ectopic pregnancy and gestational age is sometimes difficult. We experienced a case of an unexpected 13-week tubal pregnancy that was not able to be diagnosed with an accurate pregnancy site and gestational age by transvaginal sonography before surgery. Under massive hemoperitoneum, forceps penetrated the area of pregnancy, which led to further massive bleeding. However, laparoscopic surgery was able to be performed. The findings in our case suggest the importance of examining with transabdominal sonography, especially in an emergency and in advanced tubal pregnancy. In addition, careful manipulation of forceps is required when the ectopic pregnancy mass is large."

Clinical, biological and ultrasonographic characteristics were collected, in particular the analysis of ultrasound scans according to the scoring score of standardized planes (total score out of 15). EP diagnosed at first ultrasound and those from Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) were compared. Hundred and seventeen patients were included: 45 (38.5%) in the group \"EP from PLU\" and 72 (61.5%) in the group \"EP diagnosed directly\". The ultrasound images were significantly better in the \"directly diagnosed EP\" group than in the \"EP from PUL\" group: 11.9/15 vs. 10.07/15 respectively (P=0.005). Moreover, in the group \"EP from PUL\", the images were significantly better on the final ultrasound diagnosing the EP compared to the first ultrasound performed: 11.4/15 vs. 10.07/17 (P=0.04). The evaluation of quality of ultrasound scan using a standardized scoring system shows an impact in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancies."

In this study, we report a rare case of spontaneous right distal tubal pregnancy after bilateral laparoscopic tubal sterilization. A 36-year-old woman who had undergone bilateral laparoscopic tubal sterilization presented with abdominal pain and a positive test for pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy was suspected based on absence of gestational sac in the uterine cavity on ultrasound and elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level. Since the patient had unstable vitals, emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed, which revealed a right distal fallopian tube pregnancy. We performed a complete bilateral residual tubal stump excision. The patient recovered well after surgery, with a reduction in β-hCG level, and was discharged after 3 days. To ensure complete sterilization, the gap at the excised end needs to be adequately widened and enhanced with electro-destruction to prevent formation of a fistula."

    "abstract": "To describe the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a patient with abdominal pregnancy and to illustrate the laparoscopic technique used to manage this patient. A descriptive study approved by our local Institutional Review Board. Consent was given from the patient. A university hospital in Ashdod, Israel. On May 15th 2018, a gravida 3, para 2, 37-year-old asymptomatic patient was referred to our hospital's gynecologic emergency department due to a suspected ectopic pregnancy. The patient had no relevant medical or surgical history. Her obstetric history consisted of 2 spontaneous vaginal deliveries with no other significant gynecologic history. Her menses were regular every month. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before presentation. Her β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level measured on the day before presentation was 24,856 IU/L. Physical examination was unremarkable except for a small amount of brownish vaginal discharge. A transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) exam on presentation did not demonstrate an intrauterine gestational sac, but revealed a gestational sac and a fetus next to the right adnexa, with a crown-rump length of 1.3 cm, consistent with 7+3 gestational weeks. There was a minimal amount of fluid in the pouch of Douglas. Owing to an extrauterine pregnancy with high β-hCG value, laparoscopic operative management was chosen. On entrance to the abdominal cavity, a normal uterus and 2 ovaries and fallopian tubes were observed. A small to moderate amount of blood was present in the pouch of Douglas. a 3- to 4-cm distension was noted over the right uterosacral ligament. Following delicate probing of the area, moderate to severe bleeding commenced, which was initially controlled with local pressure and oxidized regenerated cellulose. An intraoperative TVUS identified an abdominal pregnancy in the right pelvic sidewall. The gestational sac was completely dissected and removed following ureterolysis and separation of the right ureter from the specimen. Local injection of vasopressin was also used. The β-hCG level before surgery of 19,008 IU/L decreased to 6339 IU/L on postoperative day 1. The patient was discharged in good condition on postoperative day 2. A final histopathological report confirmed a gestational sac. This patient referred for a tubal ectopic pregnancy was eventually diagnosed with an abdominal pregnancy and was treated operatively with complete excision of the abdominal pregnancy, which was located at the right pelvic sidewall. Abdominal pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy with a reported incidence of 1:10,000 to 1:30,000 pregnancies, and accounts for approximately 1% of ectopic pregnancies [1]. It carries a high risk for maternal morbidity and mortality. Many different locations at different gestational ages have been reported in the literature, including the pouch of Douglas, pelvic sidewall, bowel, broad ligament, omentum, and spleen [2-4]. These varied locations and the rarity of this type of pregnancy make diagnosis and treatment challenging. The location of the growing fetal tissue may endanger the patient's life if it impinges on vital anatomic structures. In the present case, the gestational sac was very close to the right ureter, and we opted to surgically excise the gestational sac in its entirety."

Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and adjusted for potential confounding factors via multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the fifteen identified risk factors, 4 were independently associated with increased odds of EP: prior pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 13.18; 95% CI 6.19-27.42), followed by current use of levonorgestrel-only pills for emergency contraception (LNG-EC) (AOR 10.15; 95% CI 2.21-46.56), previous use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (AOR 3.01; 95% CI 1.04-8.69) and smoking at the time of conception (AOR 2.68; 95% CI 1.12-6.40). The present study confirms the wide variety of EP's risk factors. Moreover, some new findings including current use of LNG-EC, previous use of DMPA, smoking at the time of conception are noteworthy. Thus, in our limited resources country where prevention remains the cornerstone for reducing EP chances of occurrence, clinicians should do enough counselling, especially to women with known risk factors. The necessity to facilitate access to more equipment to enable early diagnosis of EP is very crucial and should be seriously considered, in order to reduce the burden of EP in Cameroonian women."

We screened 2,906 studies. Articles were included if in English, included primary research data, and referenced U.S.-based Catholic facilities. We reviewed the reference lists of included articles. We excluded articles that addressed the relationship of patient or health care provider religion to provision of reproductive services, described reproductive health care services in non-Catholic facilities, or reported legal cases or concerns. Two independent reviewers screened all citations, a third reviewer resolved differences, and all three reviewers categorized included citations. We included 27 studies. Investigators most commonly focused on the provision of emergency contraception (n=9) or other contraceptive and sterilization methods (n=7); few focused on a range of family planning methods (n=3), natural family planning (n=2), ectopic pregnancy management (n=2), abortion care (n=2), miscarriage management (n=1), and infertility care (n=1). The most common study designs were cross-sectional (18/27 [67%]) and qualitative investigations (6/27 [22%]). Common data collection approaches included surveys, interviews, and mystery caller designs. Two studies involved authors with Catholic hospital affiliations and one of these reported patient outcomes; no other patient outcome reports were found. Studies cited restrictions to care in comparison with non-Catholic settings and multisite studies demonstrated variable rates of provision of reproductive health services across Catholic sites.

    "abstract": "Tubal ectopic pregnancy (tEP) is the most common life-threatening condition in gynaecology. Treatment options include surgery and medical management. Stable women with tEPs with pre-treatment serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels < 1000 IU/L respond well to outpatient medical treatment with intramuscular methotrexate. However, tEPs with hCG > 1000 IU/L can take significant time to resolve with methotrexate and require multiple outpatient monitoring visits. In pre-clinical studies, we found that tEP implantation sites express high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor. In early-phase trials, we found that combination therapy with gefitinib, an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist, and methotrexate resolved tEPs without the need for surgery in over 70% of cases, did not cause significant toxicities, and was well tolerated. We describe the protocol of a randomised trial to assess the efficacy of combination gefitinib and methotrexate, versus methotrexate alone, in reducing the need for surgical intervention for tEPs. We propose to undertake a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial (around 70 sites across the UK) and recruit 328 women with tEPs (with pre-treatment serum hCG of 1000-5000 IU/L). Women will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio by a secure online system to receive a single dose of intramuscular methotrexate (50 mg/m2) and either oral gefitinib or matched placebo (250 mg) daily for 7 days. Participants and healthcare providers will remain blinded to treatment allocation throughout the trial. The primary outcome is the need for surgical intervention for tEP. Secondary outcomes are the need for further methotrexate treatment, time to resolution of the tEP (serum hCG ≤ 15 IU/L), number of hospital visits associated with treatment (until resolution or scheduled/emergency surgery), and the return of menses by 3 months after resolution. We will also assess adverse events and reactions until day of resolution or surgery, and participant-reported acceptability at 3 months. A medical intervention that reduces the need for surgery and resolves tEP faster would be a favourable treatment alternative. If effective, we believe that gefitinib and methotrexate could become standard care for stable tEPs. ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN67795930 . Registered 15 September 2016."

Our study is the first to assess the management of this life-threatening condition at Odi Hospital. This study aimed to determine the incidence of EP and to assess the profile of women who presented with EP at Odi District Hospital from 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. The study was conducted at Odi District Hospital, located in Mabopane, a township in Gauteng province, 45 km north of Tshwane, South Africa (SA). This was a cross-sectional study. We analysed 263 completed patient records. The incidence rate was 22 per 1000 live births. The mean age was 28.9 years (SD ± 6.09), 57% were within the age group of 25-34 years, 90.9% were single and 85.2% were unemployed. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting complaint (81.1%). Ninety-nine (37.8%) were in a state of haemorrhagic shock. Possible risk factors were not documented in the patient files for 95%. A third (34.2%) were operated on within 4 hours of consultation. Early management was associated with poor record-keeping (p = 0.02). There was a delay in confirming the diagnosis in 48.7%. It was associated with gestational age (p = 0.0017), previous abdominal surgery (p = 0.0026), normal haemoglobin level at the time of consultation (p = 0.0024), considerable haemoperitoneum at operation (p < 0.00001) and per vaginal bleeding (p = 0.003). The study highlighted the need to emphasise the importance of good record-keeping and documentation in patients, as well as the urgent need for ultrasound skills training among clinicians to implement the Essential Steps in Managing Obstetric Emergencies programme at this hospital to improve the management of EP and other obstetric emergencies."

    "abstract": "To examine the pathways of care for abortion patients transferred or referred to emergency departments (EDs) or hospitals before and after abortion-providing physicians obtained hospital admitting privileges. This case series was based on retrospective chart review at three abortion clinics in which physicians had obtained admitting privileges in the previous 5 years. We identified patients who were transferred or referred to a hospital or ED. Patients were grouped according to the pathway by which their care was transferred or referred to the ED/hospital. Both before and after admitting privileges, the majority of patients were referred to a hospital before the abortion was attempted and most were for suspected ectopic pregnancy or to perform the abortion in a hospital. Direct ambulance transfer from the facility to the ED/hospital was the least common pathway. We observed few changes in practice from before to after admitting privileges. Preexisting mechanisms of coordination and communication facilitated care that was tailored for the specific patient. We did not find evidence that physician admitting privileges influenced the pathways through which abortion patients obtain hospital-based care, as existing mechanisms of collaboration between hospitals and abortion facilities allowed for management of patients who sought hospital-based care."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy involving the implantation of an ectopic pregnancy into a prior cesarean scar with a concurrent intrauterine pregnancy is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition with minimal information in the literature to guide treatment and management options. A 40-year-old G5P3103 at 12 weeks and 3 days with a history of two cesarean deliveries was diagnosed with a live heterotopic pregnancy containing a cesarean scar ectopic and an intrauterine pregnancy. After selective reduction of the cesarean scar gestation with potassium chloride (KCl), the patient presented ten days later to the emergency department with septic abortion and sepsis. The patient underwent bilateral uterine artery embolization followed by ultrasound guided uterine evacuation with dilation and curettage, which was complicated by intraoperative hemorrhage and persistent bacteremia. The patient had resolution of her bacteremia after total abdominal hysterectomy. Conservative management of uterine infection resulting from selective reduction of a heterotopic pregnancy cesarean scar pregnancy may be considered; however, severe septicemia and persistent bacteremia may necessitate definitive surgical management."

Mortality rate is 6-7 times higher than that in classical ectopic pregnancy. Uterine rupture has been typically reported to occur at more advanced gestational ages compared to tubal pregnancy although several recent reports have shown a high risk of rupture before 12 weeks of gestation. We report three cases of women affected by interstitial pregnancy, with different clinical symptoms, and managed to be treated with surgery or medical therapy. An emergency laparotomy was performed in the first case by the general surgeon, while in the second case laparoscopy was made by a gynecologist; last case shows the success of systemic administration of methotrexate. Interstitial pregnancy is still a challenging condition to diagnose and treat; early diagnosis may help to choose the proper management."

    "abstract": "A 40 year old woman with a history of a myomectomy visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan, following 2 years of infertility. Magnetic resonance imaging detected an abnormal endometrial-like pseudo-cavity. A hysterosalpingography also revealed an abnormal accumulation of contrast medium at the myometrial scar site. A transvaginal ultrasound showed a thin myometrium at the lower uterine body. The patient conceived via in vitro fertilization under a luteal phase down-regulation protocol (long protocol) for controlled ovarian stimulation, followed by a cryopreserved embryo transfer during her natural ovulation cycle. After the embryo transfer, the gestational sac was located at the subserosal site of the myomectomy scar. An emergent laparoscopic operation was performed and the embryo was removed successfully via laparoscopy under transvaginal ultrasonography. A subserosal uterine pregnancy is a rare form of intramural pregnancy, which is a rare subtype of an ectopic pregnancy, which could occur at the myomectomy site, especially after an embryo transfer. It is believed that this rare ectopic pregnancy resulted from embryo implantation under the serosa through a micro-sinus tract that was a site of suture failure of the myomectomy scar and was partially affected by the embryo transfer. Clinicians should consider the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy after uterine surgery, including a myomectomy."

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate diagnosis and management of an ectopic pregnancy developing in a previous cesarean scar. Between March 2003 and October 2015, total 64 cases of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) were retrospectively reviewed. The cliniscal characteristics, diagnosis, various methods of treatment and clinical outcomes were analyzed. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 6.5 ± 1.1 weeks and the number of previous cesarean section was 1.6 ± 0.6. The main ultrasonographic findings included anterior implantation of gestational sac within the previous CS scar and thinning of anterior myometrium (average: 3.0 ± 2.0 mm). Excluding 6 cases that were lost to follow up after diagnosis, 58 patients underwent first line treatment. The treatment was successful with first line therapy alone in 32 patients (55.2%). Emergency hysterectomy was necessary in 4 cases during following up of first line treatment. In 22 patients who underwent second line treatment, all of them were successfully treated with no additional treatment. MTX treatment alone as first line treatment showed low success rate (41.3%). Wedge resection (100%) and hysteroscopy (66.7%) were relatively safe and they were the most successful treatment modalities in this study. Dilatation and curettage as first and second line treatment had about 20% and 16.7% risk of emergency hysterectomy due to severe hemorrhage respectively. Therefore, surgical modalities with direct visualization excluding dilatation and curettage seem to be more safe and successful than medical treatment using MTX alone. Early precise diagnosis and management of CSP will be very important to minimize the extent of treatment and thus improve clinical outcomes of the patients."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) in IVF is rare, however, the consequences are significant, which include ovariotomy. In the present study, it was aimed for the first time to compare the incidence of OT between hCG triggered cycles with ICSI and fresh transfer and GnRH-agonist triggered cycles with the ICSI-freeze-all and frozen embryo transfer (FET). In total, 15,577 ICSI cycles performed between 2001 and 2016 were categorised into two groups (Group 1, n: 9978): cycles with controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and hCG-triggered (Group 2, n: 5599) and COS, with GnRH-agonist only triggered and freeze-all. Thirteen patients (0.13%) were diagnosed with OT and corrected by laparoscopy (12) and laparotomy (1) in Group 1. One patient (0.018%) was diagnosed with OT and corrected by laparotomy in Group 2 (Group 1 vs. Group 2, p = .049). The incidence of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was 2.4% in Group 1 and 0.05% in Group 2 (p < .001). The use of freeze-all with GnRH agonist trigger in ART significantly reduced the incidence of OT and concomitantly OHSS, with no effect on the reproductive outcome. Impact Statement What is already known on this subject? Adnexal ovarian torsion (OT) is a well-known gynaecological event that constitutes a surgical emergency. Assisted reproduction technologies (ART) may result in ovarian conditions that predispose patients to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and torsion. What the results of this study add? The combined use of GnRH agonist trigger for final oocyte maturation after OS with freeze-all and frozen embryo transfer (FET) significantly reduces the incidence of OT, as well as OHSS. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The treatment strategy of GnRH agonist trigger with freeze-all significantly reduces the risks of adverse complications."

She had acute abdominal pain and fever 18 h after insertion of a levonorgestrel intrauterine device (IUD). She had a normal vaginal delivery 45 days earlier, and no other significant medical background. In a few hours the symptoms worsened, with rapid progression towards multiorgan failure. Differential diagnoses of late ovarian thrombophlebitis and ovarian torsion were considered. Laparoscopic surgery revealed the absence of ovarian torsion. The microbiologic culture of the IUD showed colonization by GAS. The sudden onset of shock-like symptoms in a postpartum woman with rapid progression towards multiorgan failure should prompt consideration of a diagnosis of GAS infection, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated to avoid the possible fatal consequences of this aggressive infection."

A 41-year-old, woman, gravida 7, para 6, with a history of low transverse cesarean section 2 years back presented with an estimated 6 weeks gestational age and viable spontaneous twin, monochorionic diamniotic gestation. The patient presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of vaginal bleeding and mild lower abdominal pain for 5 days. An ultrasound examination was performed demonstrating a single intrauterine gestational sac with 2 viable embryos (monochorionic diamniotic) implanted in the lower uterine segment at the level of the prior cesarean section scar. A diagnosis of viable cesarean scar twin pregnancy was made. A 2 doses of 50 mg/m methotrexate (MTX) was given intramuscularly. The response to the treatment was monitored by serial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and ultrasound. Patient was followed up with β-hCG weekly levels which became 0 after 68 days of treatment. During the follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, no side effects of MTX were noticed. We reported a rare case of viable monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy on a cesarean scar that was successfully treated with systemic MTX without any additional therapy. Additionally, the decline of β-hCG in twin ectopic cesarean scar pregnancy appears to be similar to a singleton ectopic pregnancy."

It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999. GTM has been used by several surgical specialties; however, it is a possibly an under-used tool in obstetrics and gynecology. A limited number of studies have been performed on its use during laparoscopic endometrioma excision and myomectomy. It may prove useful in endometrioma excision in reproductive aged women because it is likely to harm ovarian reserve less than electrocautery; however, this conclusion needs to be validated. The only study on GTM use in myomectomy included 50 women randomized into GTM and control groups, and showed decreased blood loss and shorter hospital stays in the GTM group. In gynecologic oncology, it was successfully used to reduce lymphocele cases in a cohort study. GTM has been used successfully in obstetrics in a handful of cases of uncontrolled bleeding from caesarean scar, placental site, ectopic pregnancy, rectovaginal hematoma, and venous plexus over the vaginal vault after emergency postpartum hysterectomy. Risk of viral transmission is a major concern about GTM, yet there are no reports on disease transmission with GTM use to date. Rare but serious adverse effects and complications have been reported such as fatal or near-fatal thromboembolism and small bowel obstruction. Although GTM is mostly a safe product, it is still not free of complications and risks. In conclusion, although routine use of GTM cannot be recommended due to concerns about its safety, cost, and availability, it may prove useful when conventional hemostatic methods such as suturing and electrocauterization fail or are not appropriate."

Little is known and/or studied about the adverse effects of levonorgestrel, therefore, current investigation was aimed to generate signal for unreported adverse drug reactions of levonorgestrel using disproportionality analysis in food and drug administration adverse events reporting system database. In FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) database, all adverse event reports for levonorgestrel between January 2006 to June 2015 were identified and disproportionality analysis was conducted for selected adverse events of levonorgestrel using Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio and Information Component with 95% confidence interval. A disproportionality analysis was done for 15 adverse events of levonorgestrel; out of these, signal for 10 adverse events was found and among them menstruation delayed was reported maximum (1791), followed by pregnancy after post-coital contraception (942), breast tenderness (901), metrorrhagia (899), dysmenorrhea (822), menorrhagia (541), nipple disorder (141), breast enlargement (77), ectopic pregnancy (61) and premenstrual syndrome (35). Pregnancy after post-coital contraception showed the highest signal having the Information Component value of 129.2, Reporting Odds Ratio value of 6.51 and Proportional Reporting Ratio value of 6.49. In this paper, ten novel AEs were identified that were disproportionately reported with the use of LNG by using data mining techniques. Although a causal relationship cannot be established, the number of cases reported suggests that there might be an association. If confirmed by epidemiologic studies, the findings from this study would have potential implications for the use of LNG and patient management in clinical practice."

A 10-year retrospective study (January 2006 to December 2015) was conducted. The number of patients assessed, sources and reasons for referral, and treatments provided were reviewed. The numbers of ER assessments and reassessments for abortion, hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy from January 2004 to December 2005 (pre-EPAC) and January 2006 to December 2015 (post-EPAC) were also reviewed. There were 11 349 new referrals and 10 764 follow-up visits. The reasons for referral were threatened miscarriage (n = 3568, 31.4%), missed miscarriage (n = 3056, 26.9%), incomplete miscarriage (n = 1064, 9.4%), complete miscarriage (n = 991, 8.7%), ectopic pregnancy (n = 857, 7.6%), hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 139, 1.2%), and others (n = 1674, 14.8%). There has been a significant decreasing trend (tau = -0.60, P = 0.0127) and a significant decrease in the post-EPAC rate of ER reassessments (P = 0.0396) for hemorrhage, with a concomitant decrease in EPAC visits for hemorrhage. In addition, there has been a significant increasing trend (tau = 0.64, P = 0.0081) and a significant increase in the post-EPAC rate of ER assessments (P = 0.00001) for ectopic pregnancies. Over the 10-year period, the EPAC has remained a vital service for managing early pregnancy complications for women. However, the clinic has not yet had a sustained impact on ER visits for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage. It is possible that a reduction in ER assessments and reassessments for early pregnancy complications can be achieved through a clinic with daily access. Cette étude visait à évaluer la valeur à long terme d'une clinique d'évaluation précoce de la grossesse (EPAC) dans la prise en charge des complications en début de grossesse ainsi que l'incidence sur les visites aux urgences.

Nous avons également examiné le nombre d'évaluations et de réévaluations aux urgences pour un avortement, des saignements et une grossesse extra-utérine de janvier 2004 à décembre 2005 (avant l'EPAC) ainsi que de janvier 2006 à décembre 2015 (après la mise en place de l'EPAC). Pendant la période à l'étude, il y a eu à l'EPAC 11 349 nouvelles recommandations et 10 764 visites de suivi. Voici les motifs des recommandations : risque de fausse couche (n = 3 568; 31,4 %), fausse couche asymptomatique (n = 3 056; 26,9 %), fausse couche incomplète (n = 1 064; 9,4 %), fausse couche complète (n = 991; 8,7 %), grossesse extra-utérine (n = 857; 7,6 %), hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 139; 1,2 %) et autres (n = 1 674; 14,8 %). On notait une importante tendance à la baisse (tau = −0,60; P  = 0,0127) et une baisse significative dans le taux de réévaluations faites aux urgences (P = 0,0396) pour des saignements après la mise en place de l'EPAC, de même qu'une baisse des visites à l'EPAC pour le même motif. En outre, on observait une importante tendance à la hausse (tau = 0,64; P  = 0,0081) et une hausse significative des taux d'évaluation aux urgences après la mise en place de l'EPAC (P = 0,00001) pour une grossesse extra-utérine. Pendant les 10 années de l'étude, l'EPAC est demeurée un service essentiel pour la prise en charge des complications en début de grossesse. Cette approche n'a toutefois pas entraîné d'effet durable sur les visites aux urgences pour une fausse couche, une grossesse extra-utérine ou des saignements.

    "abstract": "Color and power Doppler ultrasound are commonly used in the evaluation of ovarian torsion but are unreliable. Because normal-sized ovaries are unlikely to cause torsion, maximum ovarian diameter (MOD) could theoretically be used as a screening test in the ED. Identification of MOD values below which torsion is unlikely would be of benefit to providers interpreting radiology department or point-of-care pelvic ultrasound. The objective was to determine if sonographic MOD can be used as a screening tool to rule out torsion in selected patients. Via a retrospective case-control study spanning a 14-year period, we examined the ultrasound characteristics of patients with torsion and age-matched controls, all presenting to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and receiving a radiology department pelvic ultrasound for \"rule-out torsion.\" Standardized data collection forms were utilized. Distributions of MOD were compared and sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated for multiple cutoffs. We identified 92 cases of surgically confirmed ovarian torsion and selected 92 age-matched controls. In postmenarchal patients the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of 3- and 5-cm MODs were 100% (96%-100%), 30% (20%-41%), 1.4 (1.3-1.7), and 0 and 91% (83%-97%), 92% (83%-97%), 11.2 (5.5-22.9), and 0.09 (0.04-0.19), respectively. The 5-cm MOD, however, excluded an additional 52 of 84 (62%) postmenarchal patients. A threshold MOD of 5 cm on pelvic ultrasound may be useful to rule out ovarian torsion in postmenarchal females presenting with lower abdominal and pelvic pain."

A 36-year-old woman at 32 + 5 weeks gestational age was admitted to hospital due to recurrent severe left lower abdominal pain. Doppler ultrasound failed to demonstrate the ovarian diseases, while MRI scan suspected the diagnosis of adnexal torsion. The patient received emergent exploratory laparotomy, and the left adnexa with a necrotic ovary was removed. Tocolytic therapy was used before and after surgery. Finally, she delivered a healthy full-term infant via cesarean section. Adnexal torsion occurring in a normal-sized ovary was quite rare in the third trimester pregnancy. MRI might be better than ultrasound in the early diagnosis of ovarian torsion."

A retrospective chart review on cases of AT from 2007 to 2016 at a single Children's hospital was performed on the basis of International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes. A standardized chart review form was used in data extraction. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Chart review identified 245 torsion cases in 237 patients. The mean age was 12.4 ± 3.29 years. Of the participants, 230 (94%) underwent minimally invasive laparoscopy with ovarian preservation in 233 (95%) of the cases. There were no complications due to detorsion of the affected adnexa. Intraoperatively, the right adnexa was affected in 134 (55%) cases and a lesion was noted in 193 (79%) cases, most commonly paratubal cysts and mature teratomas. The malignancy rate was low, noted only in 4/245 patients at (1.2%). Pediatric gynecology performed most of the cases (n = 214; 87%). The findings of our study continue to support the conservative management of patients with AT."

    "abstract": "Prompt diagnosis and management are essential for saving the adnexal organs from infarction in cases of ovarian torsion (OT). This study aimed to determine the diagnostic significance of signal peptide, complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CUB), and epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein-1 (SCUBE-1) levels in cases of OT, an emergent ischemic condition, and the relationship of SCUBE-1 with oxidative stress parameters. This prospective study was conducted among 15 OT patients and 20 age- and gravidity-matched healthy women. SCUBE-1 serum concentrations were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring the serum levels of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and glutathione (GSH). The SCUBE-1 titers were significantly higher in the patients with OT than in the controls (p=0.008). In addition, serum FRAP and GSH levels were significantly lower in the OT patients than in the controls (p<0.001 for both). Serum AOPP levels were higher in the OT patients, but this trend was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Furthermore, there were no correlations between SCUBE-1 levels and age, gravidity, parity, cyst size, and AOPP, FRAP, or GSH levels (p>0.05). We believe that SCUBE-1 may be a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis of OT."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a dangerous gynecological emergency condition. Early diagnosis of this case is necessary to preserve the function of the ovaries and fallopian tubes and prevent further damage. Ovarian torsion means complete or partial rotation of the adnexa with ischemia followed by reperfusion period. Ovarian torsion affects 2%-15% of patients who have surgical treatment of adnexal masses. We investigated the effect of pioglitazone (PIO) on induced ovarian ischemia reperfusion (OIR). PIO (10, 30 mg/kg) was administered orally in the presence or absence of induced OIR. We measured ovarian tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), total nitrites (NOx), reduced glutathione (GSH), heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Moreover, expression of p53 and histopathological changes were also evaluated. Results showed increase in the ovarian tissue levels of MDA and NOx and gene expressions of p53, TNFα, and iNOS in the induced OIR group. The induced OIR group showed the histopathological changes associated with cell injury, marked ovarian edema, hemorrhage and congestion. In addition, there was reduction in the GSH, HO-1 levels and PPARγ, eNOS gene expressions. PIO was able to reduce these induced OIR changes to levels insignificant from control group. This protective effect of PIO may be attributed to its PPARγ agonist effect, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant properties."

The purpose of this study was to analyze the diseases through gynecological emergency ultrasound in daytime and at night and to evaluate the day-night difference in the accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis. Retrospective analysis was performed on the 2016 clinical data of the patients who had undergone gynecological emergency ultrasound at The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, and the results of the ultrasound diagnosis were compared with the clinical diagnosis. The following categories of gynecologic emergency diseases during the daytime and at night have significant statistical differences in the constituent ratio (P<0.001); ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine pregnancy, acute pelvic inflammatory disease, no organic lesion in uterine and adnexa; while the constituent ratio of abortion and trophoblastic diseases, ovarian tumor, uterine and endometrial lesions, was no statistical difference during the daytime and at night (P>0.05). The overall coincidence rate of ultrasound diagnosis was 96.3% (daytime, 97.9%; night, 86.4%). The coincidence rates of ectopic pregnancy ultrasonography diagnosis in daytime and at night were 96.4 and 75.4%, respectively; the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Since the different constituent ratio of disease between daytime and night gynecological emergency ultrasound was significantly different, and the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound at night was low; hence, the ultrasound doctor at night should pay attention to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the ability of differential diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, and it is suggested that some suspected cases during the night should be reexamined again in the daytime to eliminate the errors resulted from subjective factors."

We could not identify any normal gestational sac in the endometrium, or specific ectopic pregnancies, on an initial ultrasound scan. However, there was a large hematoma in the cul-de-sac and free fluid in the right paracolic gutter. We decided to perform emergent laparoscopic surgery.

On the other hand, the therapeutic effect of conservative treatment using methotrexate is not satisfactory. A case of retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy which was diagnosed in the PLA general hospital was reported here. A 34-year-old woman, gravida 2, parturition 0, was admitted via the emergency department on July 7, 2015 with the main complaint of missed period for 52 days and bellyache for 16 h. The mechanisms of retroperitoneal embryo migration and related literatures are reviewed and discussed. We have presented a scarce case of REP. As the ectopic pregnancy could not be readily detected by laparotomy, unusual locations such as the retroperitoneum should be carefully examined."

However, our understanding of the effects of levonorgestrel and progesterone on oviductal physiology is limited. The receptivity of the fallopian tubal epithelium after levonorgestrel and progesterone treatment was examined through western blots for receptivity markers and JAr-spheroid-fallopian tubal epithelial cell attachment assays. The ciliary beat frequency was analyzed using an inverted bright-field microscope. Furthermore, an in vivo animal model of embryo-tubal transplantation was also studied to determine the effects of levonorgestrel- and progesterone-induced ciliary beat reduction. Our results showed that levonorgestrel and progesterone did not change the levels of fallopian tubal epithelial cell receptive markers, including LIF, STAT3, IGFBP1, ITGB3, MUC1, and ACVR1B, or affect JAr-spheroid implantation. However, levonorgestrel and progesterone reduced the ciliary beat frequency in fallopian tubes in a dose-dependent manner. An in vivo model also showed that levonorgestrel and progesterone could lead to embryo retention in the oviducts. These findings show that levonorgestrel and progesterone can reduce the ciliary beat frequency without altering receptivity, indicating a possible mechanism for progesterone- or levonorgestrel-induced tubal pregnancy."

    "abstract": "To present a case of a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy treated by laparoscopic resection followed by isthmocele repair. A case report. The University Gynecology Clinic of the Emergency Clinical City Hospital Timișoara, Timișoara, România. Cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy. In recent years, its prevalence has risen because of the increasing number of cesarean sections. An early diagnosis can lead to early management, decreasing the risk of life-threatening complications such as uterine rupture and massive hemorrhage. Many therapeutic options are available, medical and surgical, but the current literature suggests that the laparoscopic approach with ectopic pregnancy resection is the best option. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman with a previous cesarean section in 2012 who was diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound with a 6-week live pregnancy implanted at the level of the cesarean scar. The initial management was the administration of a 2-dose methotrexate protocol, but after 72 hours the transvaginal ultrasound showed an embryo with cardiac activity still present associated with an increased beta human chorionic gonadotropin level. We decided on laparoscopic surgical treatment, aiming to extract the pregnancy and repair the scar defect. A similar case was presented by Mahgoub et al [1], but their case had a different evolution, with decreasing levels of hCG. In order to reduce the blood loss, the anterior trunks of the hypogastric arteries were clipped. The side wall peritoneum was cut bilaterally, and the ureters and the hypogastric arteries were dissected. Next, we performed the dissection of the vesicouterine space. Because of the previous cesarean section, the identification of the correct dissection plane was difficult. A uterine manipulator was used to facilitate the dissection. The exact location of the gestational sac was demonstrated using intraoperative transvaginal ultrasound. To reduce the bleeding, Glypressin (Ferring GmbH, Saint Prex, Switzerland) was injected at the level of the uterine scar. The cesarean scar was cut using a monopolar knife. The gestation sac was reached easily and then extracted from the abdominal cavity with the use of an endobag. In order to obtain proper healing, the margins of the scar were resected using cold scissors. The hysterotomy was closed using a double-layered suture with 2.0 Vicryl (Ethicon Inc., Cincinnati, OH). We used methylene blue to verify the tightness of the suture. The final step was the removal of the clips. The operative time was 85 minutes with minimal blood loss of about 20 mL. The patient recovered well and was discharged 2 days after the procedure. A transvaginal ultrasound was performed 1 month after the surgery showing good healing of the anterior uterine wall. The laparoscopic approach with excision and repair of the uterine wall represents a safe and efficient therapeutic option for the treatment of the cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy."

We report a rare occurrence of bilateral ovarian torsion in a young woman. We report the case of a 20-year-old white woman who presented with sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain and nausea. Similar episodes of pain were experienced in the previous few months and diagnosed as a case of bilateral ovarian cyst. She was found to have a bilateral ovarian torsion caused by adnexal mass. She was treated by laparoscopic detorsion, left salpingo-oophorectomy, and right cystectomy. This case highlights the need to perform an early laparoscopic surgical intervention in cases of bilateral ovarian mass because of the greater chance for their torsion and subsequent effects on fertility."

The patient presented with intermittent lower abdominal pains on a 20 weeks gestation associated with mild epigastralgia and 2 previous episodes of mild pervaginal bleeding (2 and 1 months ago respectively before consultation) managed with injectable progesterone. Her evolution 4 h later was marked by an increase in the intensity of the abdominal pain, an unmeasurable blood pressure and a feeble pulse. Immediate paracentesis revealed 10 cc of fresh non coagulating blood. The diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy with abundant hemoperitoneum was considered and an emergency laparotomy with fluid and blood resuscitation was carried out. A midline laparotomy revealed a ruptured caesarean scar ectopic pregnancy with an abundant hemoperitoneum. Careful resection of the placenta and repair of the ruptured isthmic region of the uterus was carried out. Recovery after surgery was without complications and the patient was discharged on the 6th day following surgery. Caesarean scar pregnancy remains a very rare obstetric condition.

It is necessary to evaluate the origin of the mass initially and to classify patients who need further evaluation and treatment for an urgent condition. We report a case of sigmoid colon rupture due to sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma presenting as acute abdomen with left adnexal mass in a 28 years old woman. Abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed a left adnexal mass with suspicion of tuboovarian abscess. In laparatomy, rupture of sigmoid colon was observed and resection of sigmoid colon was performed. Histological examination of resection part revealed diagnosis of sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma due to familial adenomatous polyposis. This case may be interesting for clinicians because pelvic pain, fever, increased infection markers in the laboratory and mass at ultrasonography or other screening methods could cause a misdiagnosis of tubaovarian abscess especially in reproductive age women. Before the operation of the pelvic mass of all age women with the diagnosis of tuboovarian abscess other causes of the pelvic abscess should come into mine and necessary preparation for operation must be done."

We calculated yearly PID and EP diagnosis rates in three states (Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland) for women aged 15-44 years using hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) attendance data, with population and live birth denominators. We stratified PID diagnoses as chlamydial-related or gonorrhoeal-related (Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)-related or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG)-related), acute, unspecified and chronic, and analysed variations by year, age and residential area using Poisson regression models. For PID, the rate of all admissions in 2014 was 63.3 per 100 000 women (95% CI 60.8 to 65.9) and of all presentations in EDs was 97.0 per 100 000 women (95% CI 93.9 to 100.2). Comparing 2014 with 2009, the rate of all PID admissions did not change, but the rate of all presentations in EDs increased (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.45), and for admissions by PID category was higher for CT-related or NG-related PID (aIRR 1.73, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.28) and unspecified PID (aIRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.19), and lower for chronic PID (aIRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95). For EP, in 2014 the rate of all admissions was 17.4 (95% CI 16.9 to 17.9) per 1000 live births and of all ED presentations was 15.6 (95% CI 15.1 to 16.1).

The management was done based on standard practice. All the cases underwent urine pregnancy test, routine blood investigations including blood group, and transvaginal ultrasound. Serial βhCG was measured in cases where the diagnosis was not clear initially. Incidence of ectopic was 2.46 per 100 deliveries; there was no apparent risk factor in 28.7% and many cases had more than one risk factor. 'Triad' of ectopic was present in only 21 cases. Sixteen cases were asymptomatic and two were admitted as emergency. Ultrasound findings were inconsistent and wide ranging.

Normal Doppler flow does not necessarily exclude an ovarian torsion; in fact, it may lead to missing the diagnosis and has been show to delay management. The objective of our study was to assess sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian torsion and to analyze the factors contributing to correct and incorrect diagnosis. All women presenting with abdominal pain and admitted for urgent/emergent surgery to the gynaecology service at a major teaching hospital between September 2010 and August 2015 were reviewed. Of those, 55 cases of surgically proven ovarian torsion and 48 control cases were selected. Ultrasound reports were reviewed and analyzed. Sixty-one percent of right ovarian torsion case and 27% of left ovarian torsion cases had normal Doppler flow. Presence of ovarian cysts was significantly associated with torsion. Sensitivity of ultrasound was 70% and specificity was 87%. While ultrasound can be used to support a diagnosis of ovarian torsion, it is a clinical diagnosis that requires integration of many factors, especially patient presentation and exclusion of other non-gynaecological pathologies. Doppler flow is not a useful variable to diagnose or exclude ovarian torsion and we recommend it should not be used to exclude a diagnosis of ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "Ovarian and testicular torsions are emergencies requiring prompt surgical treatment to preserve gonadal function. However, diagnosis in females is often delayed owing to nonspecific symptoms. We sought to assess disparities in management and outcomes between males and females with torsion. The National Inpatient Sample was queried for pediatric patients with \"emergent\", \"urgent\", or \"trauma center\" admission and ICD-9 codes for ovarian torsion and testicular torsion. Demographic data, operative procedure, gonadal loss, length of stay (LOS), total charges (TC), and mortality were recorded. There were 2254 unweighted encounters. The average age was 11.56±5.30years for males and 12.55±3.72years for females (p<0.001). Among males, 90% underwent surgery (p<0.001), of which 40% required orchiectomy. Conversely, 73% of females had surgery (p<0.001), of which 78% had oophorectomy. Subsequent analysis with only patients who underwent surgery showed that insurance status (p=0.012), race (p<0.001), and U.S. region (p<0.001) were significantly different between males and females. Gender specific analyses showed that hospital control, hospital location/teaching status, and treatment year were also significant. As such, these six factors in addition to age and gender were used for propensity score matching (PSM). PSM produced two gender cohorts of 755 encounters each. Females had longer LOS (2.44±1.84days vs. 1.28±2.27days for males, p<0.001) and had higher TC ($20,058.44±13,420.82) compared to males ($12,386.58±12,793.34), p<0.001. Logistic regression revealed that males (OR 0.163 [0.130-0.206]) and older patients (age OR 0.924 [0.903-0.946]) were less likely to undergo gonadal loss. Compared to those with private insurance, those with Medicare/Medicaid were more likely to have gonadal loss (1.401 [1.101-1.783]). Disparities exist in the management of torsion based on gender. Overall, females had higher charges, had longer hospitalization, and were more likely to have gonadal loss despite current data supporting gonadal preservation for nearly all cases of ovarian torsion.

A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed at an urban academic safety net hospital and 2 Naval medical centers in the United States. The allocation was concealed before enrollment. Clinically stable adult pregnant women at less than 20 weeks' gestation who presented to the ED with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding were randomized to receive a point-of-care or radiology US to assess for IUP. The primary outcome measure was the ED LOS. A total of 224 patients (point-of-care US, n = 118; radiology US, n = 106) were included for the analysis. The ED LOS was 20 minutes shorter in the point-of-care US arm (95% confidence interval [CI], -54 to 7 minutes). Adjusting for variability due to the location, the ED LOS was calculated to be 31 minutes shorter (95% CI, -64 to 1 minute) than for patients in the radiology US arm. Excluding patients in the point-of-care US arm who crossed over to radiology US after an inconclusive point-of-care US examination, the ED LOS was 75 minutes shorter than in the radiology US arm (95% CI, -97 to -53 minutes). Early-gestation pregnant ED patients requiring pelvic US were discharged earlier when point-of-care US was used rather than radiology US; however, this trial did not achieve our target of 30 minutes. Nevertheless, our data support the routine use of ED point-of-care US for IUP, saving the most time if a conclusive IUP is identified."

    "abstract": "A positive urine pregnancy test (UPT) with adnexal mass in ectopic pregnancy is not the ultimate diagnosis. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is about 27 per 1000 pregnancies [1]. On average, about 6-16% will present to an emergency department with first-trimester bleeding and abdominal pain [2]. On presenting with these symptoms with the simultaneous presence of an adnexal mass and an empty uterus, a UPT is of paramount importance to determine whether the symptoms are pregnancy related or not. When the UPT is positive, an ectopic pregnancy is not the only diagnosis as the rare entity of non-gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma (NGOC) should be considered. Here we present two case reports of NGOC, which were initially diagnosed as ectopic pregnancy. The first case is a 16-year-old girl, with vaginal bleeding and an adnexal mass due to an ovarian choriocarcinoma, She underwent unilateral oophorectomy and received multiple courses of chemotherapy. She is disease free without evidence of recurrence or metastasis after 12 months of follow-up. The second patient is also 16 years old and presented with an acute abdomen. She was diagnosed as a ruptured luteal cyst and underwent partial oophorectomy. When the pathologist diagnosed a choriocarcinoma she received multiple courses of chemotherapy, but thereafter an advanced disease was diagnosed with evidence of distant metastasis."

    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to provide a three-dimensional (3D) microscopic reconstruction of morphological modifications of the fallopian tube (FT) following surgical sterilization (including tuboperitoneal fistula) and ectopic pregnancy (EP) using confocal microtomography (micro-CT). Methods: Six specimens of FT from elective and emergency surgeries were selected: three remnants of the FT (RFT) from surgical sterilization, including one presenting tuboperitoneal fistula, and three FTs with EP. The specimens were fixed in formalin and stained with Lugol solution. Micro-CT studies were conducted on the specimens using protocols adapted from biological studies. Results: Three RFTs from surgical sterilization and three FTs affected by EPs were successfully scanned using micro-CT. There was good contrast impregnation, allowing tissue segmentation and analysis of different sections of the FTs. Three FT specimens from EP exhibited considerable distortion of the tubal anatomy, mainly from the blood clot in the tubal abortion. Three RFT specimens exhibited some features observed in traditional microscopy, such as tubal distension and loss of normal anatomical characteristics of a normal FT, and indicated the presence of a tuboperitoneal fistula in one of the three specimens. Conclusion: Micro-CT can identify morphological characteristics of FT pathologies previously described in a microscopic scale, with tissue contrast and the possibility of 3D reconstruction. Micro-CT is also useful in guiding traditional sectioning of specimens for histopathological studies."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of women who had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy after being discharged from the emergency department (ED) where ectopic pregnancy had not yet been excluded. This was a retrospective chart review of pregnant (<12-week gestational age) women discharged home from an academic tertiary care ED with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, rule-out ectopic pregnancy, or pregnancy of unknown location over a 7-year period. Of the 550 included patients, 83 (15.1%) had a viable pregnancy, 94 (17.1%) had a spontaneous or missed abortion, 230 (41.8%) had an ectopic pregnancy, 72 (13.1%) had unknown outcomes, and 71 (12.9%) had other outcomes that included therapeutic abortion, molar pregnancy, or resolution of βHCG with no location documented. Of the 230 ectopic pregnancies, 42 (7.6%) underwent expectant management, 131 (23.8%) were managed medically with methotrexate, 29 (5.3%) were managed with surgical intervention, and 28 (5.1%) patients had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy after their index ED visit. Of the 550 included patients, 221 (40.2%) did not have a transvaginal ultrasound during their index ED visit, and 73 (33.0%) were subsequently diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. These results may be useful for ED physicians counselling women with symptomatic early pregnancies about the risk of ectopic pregnancy after they are discharged from the ED."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT). We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized; the patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult."

To review the clinical presentations, risk factors, treatment options, and outcome of heterotopic interstitial pregnancies. We describe the clinical presentation, management, and outcome of a patient with a heterotopic interstitial pregnancy, diagnosed following second trimester rupture of the interstitial pregnancy. We reviewed all published cases of heterotopic interstitial pregnancies. A 35-year-old pregnant woman with a past history of right adnexectomy and 16 weeks pregnant with dichorionic diamniotic twins following IVF-ET, was admitted to our department with unexplained recurrent abdominal pain and anemia. Further investigation showed a hemoperitoneum and because of hypovolemic shock an emergency laparotomy was performed, with diagnosis of a ruptured heterotopic interstitial pregnancy. The uterine defect was sutured using simple interrupted sutures. The intrauterine pregnancy progressed uneventful afterwards.We found 86 cases in the published literature, reporting on heterotopic interstitial pregnancies. 80.2% (69/86) occurred after IVF-ET. History of uni- or bilateral salpingectomy is a major risk factor, present in 39.5% (34/86). 37.2% (32/86) presented with cornual rupture. Surgery was performed in 53.5% (46/86) of cases. Medical management was possible in case of unruptured, early diagnosed heterotopic interstitial pregnancy (32.6% (28/86)). Watchful waiting was only possible when the interstitial pregnancy miscarried (5.8% (5/86)). The live birth rate of the intrauterine pregnancy, when viable at presentation, was 70.0% (56/80). The live birth rate of the interstitial pregnancy was only 4.7% (4/86). The majority of cases are diagnosed by detailed ultrasound in the setting of early follow-up after IVF-ET and are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Yet, a substantial number of patients present with cornual rupture. Risk factors are IVF-ET and a history of salpingectomy. Depending on clinical presentation, treatment options include watchful waiting, medical treatment, or surgery. Unfortunately, the interstitial pregnancy is generally lost, and only has a chance of survival in case of presentation at a viable gestational age. The outcome of the coexisting intrauterine pregnancy is generally good."

    "title": "Cost-effectiveness of emergency contraception options over 1 year.",
    "abstract": "The copper intrauterine device is the most effective form of emergency contraception and can also provide long-term contraception. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device has also been studied in combination with oral levonorgestrel for women seeking emergency contraception. However, intrauterine devices have higher up-front costs than oral methods, such as ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel. Health care payers and decision makers (eg, health care insurers, government programs) with financial constraints must determine if the increased effectiveness of intrauterine device emergency contraception methods are worth the additional costs. We sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 emergency contraception strategies-ulipristal acetate, oral levonorgestrel, copper intrauterine device, and oral levonorgestrel plus same-day levonorgestrel intrauterine device-over 1 year from a US payer perspective. Costs (2017 US dollars) and pregnancies were estimated over 1 year using a Markov model of 1000 women seeking emergency contraception. Every 28-day cycle, the model estimated the predicted number of pregnancy outcomes (ie, live birth, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, or induced abortion) resulting from emergency contraception failure and subsequent contraception use. Model inputs were derived from published literature and national sources. An emergency contraception strategy was considered cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ie, the cost to prevent 1 additional pregnancy) was less than the weighted average cost of pregnancy outcomes in the United States ($5167). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and probability of being the most cost-effective emergency contraception strategy were calculated from 1000 probabilistic model iterations. One-way sensitivity analyses were used to examine uncertainty in the cost of emergency contraception, subsequent contraception, and pregnancy outcomes as well as the model probabilities. In 1000 women seeking emergency contraception, the model estimated direct medical costs of $1,228,000 and 137 unintended pregnancies with ulipristal acetate, compared to $1,279,000 and 150 unintended pregnancies with oral levonorgestrel, $1,376,000 and 61 unintended pregnancies with copper intrauterine devices, and $1,558,000 and 63 unintended pregnancies with oral levonorgestrel plus same-day levonorgestrel intrauterine device. The copper intrauterine device was the most cost-effective emergency contraception strategy in the majority (63.9%) of model iterations and, compared to ulipristal acetate, cost $1957 per additional pregnancy prevented. Model estimates were most sensitive to changes in the cost of the copper intrauterine device (with higher copper intrauterine device costs, oral levonorgestrel plus same-day levonorgestrel intrauterine device became the most cost-effective option) and the cost of a live birth (with lower-cost births, ulipristal acetate became the most cost-effective option). When the proportion of obese women in the population increased, the copper intrauterine device became even more most cost-effective. Over 1 year, the copper intrauterine device is currently the most cost-effective emergency contraception option. Policy makers and health care insurance companies should consider the potential for long-term savings when women seeking emergency contraception can promptly obtain whatever contraceptive best meets their personal preferences and needs; this will require removing barriers and promoting access to intrauterine devices at emergency contraception visits."

    "abstract": "We reported a case of secondary abdominal pregnancy with placental implantation into the fallopian tube, diagnosed at 16 weeks, in a woman admitted to the emergency room complaining of syncopal attacks. The best approach would be termination of the pregnancy, taking into consideration the high risk to the mother and the low possibility of alive and healthy birth. We had to perform an urgent surgical intervention due to the fact that the patient was in a clinically unstable condition, which was related to hemoperitoneum. If placental implantation is on abdominal organs or vessel the best approach would be to ligate the cord and to leave placenta in situ. Taking into consideration the place of placental implant, the removal of the fallopian tube with the placenta was the safest approach in this case. The best and most acceptable form of treatment would be individualized in case of rare form of ectopic pregnancy."

Following transfusion guidelines, restrictive transfusion was performed; at Hb levels of 60-70 to 100 g/L, transfusion was continued or not based on disease status. The patients were divided into four groups: blood loss < 400 ml (N1), 400-799 ml (N2), 800-1199 ml (N3), and ≥1200 ml (N4). Several prognosis parameters were assessed. Group N4 was further divided based on blood loss amounts (1200-1999, 2000-2999, 3000-3999, and 4000-5000 ml) for subgroup analyses. Blood loss, hemoglobin levels at discharge, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores were not associated with patient prognostic parameters, including intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy, cure, and healing rates, and surgical complications and hospital stay. No statistically significant difference was obtained in hospital stay among N1, N2, and N3 groups. Compared with N1 patients, cases with blood loss ≥ 1200 ml had significantly longer hospital stay. Interestingly, hospital stay was correlated with surgical approach, location of pregnancy, and operation time. Restrictive transfusion strategy could be safely used for emergency surgery in ectopic pregnancy with acute blood loss."

Diagnosis is difficult, often delaying the management. Here, we report an exceptional association of mechanical acute intestinal obstruction due to compression by previa uterine leiomyoma, and a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This is the case report of a 43-year-old primiparous black woman from a rural area, who was admitted to the surgical emergency department for acute intestinal obstruction. At examination on admittance, our patient had a bad general condition with clinical anemia. She had an occlusive syndrome that had been evolving for 3 days. A physical examination of her abdomen showed a widespread distension with an irregular and polylobed solid mass occupying the whole of the lower-umbilical and hypogastric area. A rectal examination found an empty rectum, and the mass was perceptible in Douglas's pouch. At the vaginal examination, we found the same mass and a finger holster was clean. The diagnosis of intestinal occlusion by a tumor was retained. The laparotomy revealed a distended intestine, a ruptured right tubal ectopic pregnancy and a polymyomatous uterus. The most massive previa leiomyoma was adhering and compressing the rectal and sigmoidal hinge. A total hysterectomy was performed and histopathological examination of specimens confirmed myoma and ectopic pregnancy. The surgical follow-up was uneventful, and our patient was discharged on postoperative day 12. The etiological diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction during pregnancy is not easy, especially in the context of a low-income country where the means of biological and radiological diagnosis are lacking. A laparotomy is required before diagnosis of acute surgical abdomen and its management will depend on the intraoperative findings and the condition of the patient."

Severe adverse events are rare amongst patients treated with MTX for this condition. A 26-year-old healthy woman was admitted and treated medically with MTX for an ectopic pregnancy. The patient was treated in the standard drug labelled protocol with an intramuscular injection of 78 mg of MTX according to body surface area. Soon after, the patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of bilateral paresthesia of the lower limbs which ascended to the pelvis. After a thorough work up and imaging via MRI a diagnosis of transverse myelitis was made. Treatment was successful with corticosteroids and symptoms subsided. We propose that MTX should be used with caution and severe toxicity should be kept in mind with high index of awareness for any symptom development following treatment, especially neurological one."

The pseudoaneurysm emerged following focal injection of methotrexate (MTX) and potassium chloride with systemic MTX treatment. Due to a risk of sudden bleeding, uterine artery embolization (UAE) was recommended, but the patient hoped to avoid this if possible. Because the serum human chorionic gonadotropin level and the gestational sac were still persistent, dilation and curettage were performed with interventional radiologists on standby. Severe hemorrhage occurred and continued during the procedure, which necessitated emergent UAE. We reviewed six CSP case reports with vascular abnormalities, and all of them necessitated UAE, surgical excision, or hysterectomy. In the case of CSP combined with pseudoaneurysm, treatment should be planned carefully considering the risk of massive hemorrhage."

The field of radiology is no exception. In this paper, we assess the readability level of websites pertaining specifically to emergency radiology. Using Google, 23 terms were searched, and the top 10 results were recorded. Each link was evaluated for its readability level using a set of ten reputable readability scales. The search terms included the following: abdominal ultrasound, abdominal aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, appendicitis, cord compression, CT abdomen, cholecystitis, CT chest, diverticulitis, ectopic pregnancy, epidural hematoma, dural venous thrombosis, head CT, MRI brain, MR angiography, MRI spine, ovarian torsion, pancreatitis, pelvic ultrasound, pneumoperitoneum, pulmonary embolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural hematoma. Any content that was not written for patients was excluded. The 230 articles that were assessed were written, on average, at a 12.1 grade level. Only 2 of the 230 articles (1%) were written at the third to seventh grade recommended reading level set forth by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and American Medical Association (AMA). Fifty-two percent of the 230 articles were written so as to require a minimum of a high school education (at least a 12th grade level). Additionally, 17 of the 230 articles (7.3%) were written at a level that exceeded an undergraduate education (at least a 16th grade level). The majority of websites with emergency radiology-related patient education materials are not adhering to the NIH and AMA's recommended reading levels, and it is likely that the average reader is not benefiting fully from these information outlets. With the link between health literacy and poor health outcomes, it is important to address the online content in this area of radiology, allowing for patient to more fully benefit from their online searches."

    "abstract": "Genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection, especially among young women. Mostly asymptomatic, it can lead, if untreated, to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal factor infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Recent data suggest that Ct infections are not controlled in France and in Europe. The effectiveness of a systematic strategy for Ct screening in under-25 women remains controversial. The main objective of the i-Predict trial (Prevention of Diseases Induced by Chlamydia trachomatis) is to determine whether early screening and treatment of 18- to-24-year-old women for genital Ct infection reduces the incidence of PID over 24 months. This is a randomised prevention trial including 4000 eighteen- to twenty-four-year-old sexually active female students enrolled at five universities. The participants will provide a self-collected vaginal swab sample and fill in an electronic questionnaire at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months after recruitment. Vaginal swabs in the intervention arm will be analysed immediately for Ct positivity, and participants will be referred for treatment if they have a positive test result. Vaginal swabs from the control arm will be analysed at the end of the study. All visits to general practitioners, gynaecologists or gynaecology emergency departments for pelvic pain or other gynaecological symptoms will be recorded to evaluate the incidence of PID, and all participants will attend a final visit in a hospital gynaecology department. The primary endpoint measure will be the incidence of PID over 24 months. The outcome status (confirmed, probable or no PID) will be assessed by two independent experts blinded to group assignment and Ct status. This trial is expected to largely contribute to the development of recommendations for Ct screening in young women in France to prevent PID and related complications. It is part of a comprehensive approach to gathering data to facilitate decision-making regarding optimal strategies for Ct infection control. The control group of this randomised trial, following current recommendations, will allow better documentation of the natural history of Ct infection, a prerequisite to evaluating the impact of Ct screening. Characterisation of host immunogenetics will also allow identification of women at risk for complications. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02904811 . Registered on September 14, 2016.

Denver Health, a safety net hospital in Denver, Colorado, has established the first known early pregnancy unit in the United States. Patients with positive urine pregnancy test results who are in their first trimester by best estimation, have not had a prior ultrasound examination, and present to their primary care providers with pain, bleeding, history of an ectopic pregnancy, history of a tubal ligation, or conception with an intrauterine device in place are eligible to be evaluated in the early pregnancy unit. This article describes our clinical setup, methods, and findings in the first 2 years of the unit's inception with the intention of serving as a model for the establishment of more early pregnancy units throughout the United States."

This article reviews several of these myths in order to improve emergency department (ED) evaluation and diagnosis. EP is a difficult diagnosis and may be missed on initial ED visit. While the diagnosis is often delayed simply due to very early presentations, it can also be missed because patients may not have all the same risk factors or demonstrate the same symptoms. They may also not demonstrate the same serum B-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and trends or have the same ultrasound findings at equivalent gestational ages. Some patients with early EP may have positive ultrasound findings with serum β-hCG levels under a defined discriminatory zone (DZ). On the other hand, some patients with an early viable intrauterine pregnancy may have no visible findings on initial ultrasound, but have serum β-hCG (quantitative) levels well above the DZ. Although rare, EP has even been demonstrated in women with negative urine β-hCG tests or low serum β-hCG levels. While EP may be a challenging diagnosis, understanding the myths surrounding EP may help emergency physicians consider it, even when patient risk factors, symptoms, or ED laboratory or imaging studies do not initially or easily define the diagnosis."

    "abstract": "The management of patients presenting deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the rectum (DIER) and pregnancy intention is controversial. Assisted Reproduction Techniques (ART) are often proposed first, but this may lead to complications and further difficulties managing DIER. A 29-years-old woman was diagnosed with pre-occlusive DIER. However, she was offered in vitro fertilization (IVF) and underwent six unsuccessful cycles with serious complications: an ectopic pregnancy and a hemoperitoneum following arterial injury during oocyte retrieval, requiring two laparotomies in emergency. The patient's symptoms worsened over time and colorectal resection with diverting colostomy was performed. The patient's quality of life was then improved. In our opinion, prior ART in patients presenting DIER delays surgery and may have harmful complications. Therefore, primary surgery followed by ART may be a valuable option in some cases and should be discussed with the patients."

Women presenting in the outpatient or emergency department of a tertiary care university hospital with a positive pregnancy test and strong suspicion of EP by ultrasound and/or symptoms were eligible for the study (n=70). Tissue specimens from the surgically treated patients (n=50) were examined by histopathology as well as by a hGH-V specific immohistochemistry set-up. A highly sensitive hGH-V specific immunoassay was used to analyse serum samples collected before treatment, day 1 post surgery samples and serial samples for medical treatment. In EP patients' sera hGH-V was shown to be measurable for the first time (n=18). HGH-V however could not be detected in all patients' sera. HCG levels were significantly higher in the hGH-V serum positive group (p 0.001). HGH-V was localized to the syncytiotrophoblast in all specimens of EP examined by immunohistochemistry (n=10) regardless of the detection in the patient's blood. Placental growth hormone (hGH-V) was shown to be present both in ectopic pregnancy patients' sera and tissue. It may serve as a biomarker for monitoring the course and treatment of EP."

    "abstract": "Adnexal torsion is 1 of the most common emergency gynecological disease. It is more often diagnosed in reproductive age, but rarely in postmenopausal women. The clinical symptoms of adnexal torsion are nonspecific in postmenopausal women. Epithelial ovarian tumors are common in adults, and the risk of malignancy increases with age, especially after menopause. So, it is difficult to diagnose adnexal torsion precisely compared with reproductive women, and most cases of adnexal torsion with postmenopausal women are diagnosed as a malignancy preoperatively. We report a case of ovarian torsion with mixed epithelial tumor misdiagnosed as a malignancy in postmenopausal woman. A 65-year-old woman presented lower left abdominal pain, and there was slight abdominal distension, but no tenderness or rebound tenderness on abdominal palpation. Radiologic assessments showed a huge multiseptated cystic mass with solid portion in the left ovary, and malignancy was suspected. The test for serum tumor markers revealed normal levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). The patient underwent a laparotomy and there was torsion of the left ovary. We conducted frozen biopsy of left ovary for confirming malignancy before performing staging surgery. The result of a frozen section biopsy confirmed a borderline Brenner tumor associated with a benign mucinous tumor. Subsequently, total hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The operation was completed without addition procedures LESSONS:: Ovarian torsion is benign in most cases and malignancy is rare. Although very rare, ovarian torsion can occur in postmenopausal women, and it should be taken into consideration that the possibility of malignancy is low in postmenopausal women with normal CA-125 levels. Instead of performing staging surgery, it appears to be appropriate to carry out surgery based on the result of intraoperative frozen section biopsy so that we were able to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures."

Ovarian torsion refers to complete or partial rotation of the adnexal supporting organ with ischemia. It can affect females of all ages. Ovarian torsion occurs in around 2%-15% of patients who have surgical treatment of adnexal masses. The main risk in ovarian torsion is an ovarian mass. The most common symptom of ovarian torsion is acute onset of pelvic pain, followed by nausea and vomiting. Pelvic ultrasonography can provide information on ovarian cysts.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to help the practitioner ensure early diagnosis and response to emergencies in the first trimester by reviewing anatomy of the developing embryo, highlighting the sonographic appearance of common first-trimester emergencies, and discussing key management pathways for treating emergent cases. First-trimester fetal development is a stepwise process that can be challenging to evaluate in the emergency department (ED) setting. This is due, in part, to the complex anatomy of early pregnancy, subtlety of the sonographic findings, and the fact that fewer than half of patients with ectopic pregnancy present with the classic clinical findings of a positive pregnancy test, vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and tender adnexa. Ultrasound (US) has been the primary approach to diagnostic imaging of first-trimester emergencies, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) playing a supportive role in a small minority of cases. Familiarity with the sonographic findings diagnostic of and suspicious for early pregnancy failure, ectopic pregnancy, retained products of conception, gestational trophoblastic disease, failed intrauterine devices, and complications associated with assisted reproductive technology (ART) is critical for any emergency radiologist. Evaluation of first-trimester emergencies is challenging, and knowledge of key imaging findings and familiarity with management pathways are needed to ensure early diagnosis and response."

    "abstract": "Bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancies are a rare subset of ectopic pregnancy that can pose a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. There is no distinct clinical presentation for bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancies, although they are typically associated with assistive reproductive techniques. In addition, there is no single diagnostic feature to help clinicians delineate bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancies from other types of ectopic pregnancy prior to passing the discriminatory zone (such as heterotopic pregnancy or twin ectopic [two gestational sacs in one tube]). Diagnosis is typically made via direct visualization intraoperatively and therefore treatment is usually surgical. We present a case of spontaneous bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancies diagnosed 7 days apart via transvaginal ultrasound. The patient presented to the emergency department with pelvic pain on the contralateral side of her previously diagnosed ectopic pregnancy and vaginal spotting. Bilateral adnexal masses were visualized on ultrasound and her serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level had a 5.9% decline from day 4 to day 7 after methotrexate administration 7 days prior; gynecology was consulted. The patient was successfully treated with an additional dose of intramuscular methotrexate without any complications. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The implications of this case suggest that diagnosis of bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancies requires clinicians to have a high level of suspicion in any pregnant female with a suspected or known ectopic pregnancy who presents with pelvic pain regardless of prior diagnosis or treatment."

    "title": "What every radiologist should know about adnexal torsion.",
    "abstract": "Adnexal torsion is the fifth most common gynecologic surgical emergency, requiring clinician and radiologist awareness. It involves the rotation of the ovarian tissue on its vascular pedicle leading to stromal edema, hemorrhagic infarction, and necrosis of the adnexal structures with the subsequent sequelae. Expedient diagnosis poses a difficult challenge because the clinical presentation is variable and often misleading. Adnexal torsion can mimic malignancy as it can take a subacute, intermittent, or chronic course, and thereby can be complicated to diagnose. The torsion may occur in the normal ovary but is usually secondary to a preexisting adnexal mass. Early surgery is necessary to avoid irreversible adnexal damage and to preserve ovarian function especially in children and young women. Pelvic ultrasound forms the foundation of diagnostic evaluation due to its ability to directly and rapidly evaluate both ovarian anatomy and perfusion. Moreover, it is a noninvasive and accessible technique. However, the color Doppler appearance of the ovary should not be relied upon to rule out torsion because a torsed ovary or adnexa may still have preserved arterial flow due to the dual blood supply. MR and CT may be used as problem-solving tools needed after the ultrasound examination but should not be the first-line imaging modalities in this setting due to ionizing radiation and potential time delay in diagnosis. The goal of this article is to review the adnexal anatomy, to familiarize radiologists with the main imaging features, and to discuss the main mimickers and the most common pitfalls of adnexal torsion. Main points Adnexal torsion is an uncommon gynecological disorder caused by partial or complete rotation of the ovary and/or the Fallopian tube about the infundibulopelvic ligament. The ovaries receive a dual blood supply from the ovarian artery and uterine artery. The lack of pathognomonic symptoms and specific findings on physical examination makes this entity difficult to diagnose. Since the right adnexa are most commonly involved, symptoms may mimic acute appendicitis. Persistence of adnexal vascularization does not exclude torsion. In the pediatric age group, gray-scale ultrasound is the best modality of choice. Obtaining CT and/or MR images should not delay treatment in order to preserve ovarian viability."

These cases often cause splenic rupture in very early course of their gestation thereby presenting with hemoperitoneum in emergencies. Owing to the higher risk of exsanguination and death caused by hemoperitoneum, it is essential to diagnose these cases for proper management and better prognosis of the patients. We present the case of a 23-year-old female, gravida 2, para 1, live issue 1 presenting to the emergency outpatient department with acute abdomen and hemoperitoneum. There was no history of trauma. The patient had a positive urine pregnancy test and raised beta HCG levels. Emergency laparotomy revealed an otherwise unremarkable fallopian tube and ovary with a hemoperitoneum of 2.5 liters. A tiny splenic laceration was considered to be the source of bleeding and splenectomy was performed. Microscopy was suggestive of a primary ectopic pregnancy, spleen. Since hemoperitoneum in pregnancy is a rare but potentially fatal condition with a high risk of mortality, an accurate preoperative diagnosis is crucial in the management of such patients. The possibility of a ruptured extratubal ectopic pregnancy must be considered as one of the differential diagnoses of acute abdomen with hemoperitoneum in women of childbearing age."

Retrospective cohort study of all women diagnosed and treated with CSP in the first trimester at a single tertiary care center from 2000-2012. Main outcome measures were need for additional treatments, hemorrhage, or emergent hysterectomy. Future pregnancy outcomes were considered secondarily. Twenty-three cases of CSP treated in the first trimester were confirmed including 12 treated surgically and 11 treated nonsurgically. Of the nonsurgical patients, none treated with a combination of intrasac potassium chloride (KCl) and systemic methotrexate (MTX) required further treatment versus 5/8 (62%) of those treated with a single agent (p = 0.18). One patient who was treated with intrasac KCl alone experienced hemorrhage. Of the nine patients treated with suction dilation and curettage (D&C), two (22%) required additional intervention, but none experienced major complications. Nonsurgical therapy had a higher rate of needing further intervention (45%) than surgical therapy (17%) (p = 0.19). There was one recurrent CSP in 11 subsequent deliveries with no uterine ruptures or hysterectomies. We have described nonsurgical and surgical treatments of first trimester CSP with a low rate of major complications and no emergent hysterectomies. Of the nonsurgical therapies, single-agent treatment with either systemic MTX or intrasac KCl was associated with high rates of needing additional treatment and should be avoided.

On ultrasonographic examination, it is difficult to misdiagnose pregnancy in a bicornuate uterus as an ectopic pregnancy due to the continuity of the endometrium. A rudimentary horn of a bicornuate uterus in early pregnancy can occasionally be misdiagnosed for an ectopic pregnancy especially when compounded by severe abdominal pains and supportive sonographic evidence. Myometrial invasive grading of placenta may be necessary for emergency preparedness and consenting. Hemihysterectomy is lifesaving when percreta has caused severe postpartum haemorrhage. We present a 24-year-old primigravida who presented to the maternity department with severe abdominal pains at 35 weeks. She was pale on clinical examination and haemodynamically unstable. She underwent emergency caesarean section with a preoperative diagnosis of concealed abruptio placentae. Intraoperatively we encountered a bicornuate uterus, delivered a fresh stillbirth, and noted a placenta percreta. A hemihysterectomy was done and she recovered after transfusion without complications. A gravid horn of a bicornuate uterus may present as an ectopic pregnancy; careful assessment at laparotomy or laparoscopy is required to prevent inadvertent surgical termination of pregnancy.

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency characterized by a partial or complete rotation of the ovarian vascular pedicle, causing obstruction to venous outflow followed by arterial inflow. Clinically, ovarian torsion frequently mimics other causes of acute pelvic pain such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, renal colic etc. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality of choice for evaluation of ovarian torsion. MRI is useful as a problem-solving tool in patients with equivocal or non-diagnostic ultrasonography studies. CT is ordinarily not utilized in a young female with suspected ovarian torsion due to the radiation dose. However, the significant expansion in use of CT imaging in emergency departments for female patients presenting with acute abdominal pain has increased the likelihood that ovarian torsion may be first seen on CT. In addition, a non-specific clinical presentation may lead to an initial imaging with CT rather than ultrasonography. Ultrasound features of the ovarian torsion are well known and sufficiently described across literature as compared with the CT scan findings. In view of the increasing usage of CT as the modality of choice in emergency settings, it is imperative for the radiologist to familiarize with the CT features of ovarian torsion. An early correct diagnosis by the radiologist in clinically unsuspected cases, facilitating a prompt surgery to restore the ovarian blood flow can prevent permanent irreversible damage. There is limited published data available on the CT features of ovarian torsion. This pictorial essay illustrates CT findings with histological correlation of surgically proven ovarian torsion in our institution.

Patients who have received assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are a subset of women with an increased risk for torsion. As the ART population continues to increase, there is a need to delineate risk factors for the development of ovarian torsion in this unique population. A pilot study was performed to determine the proportion of patients with suspected ovarian torsion who have received ART and to identify possible diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian torsion among these patients. A single institution retrospective cohort study of patients taken to surgery for suspected ovarian torsion over a 5-year period. During the study period, 171 patients were taken to surgery for suspected ovarian torsion. Patients receiving ART constituted 19 (11%) of these patients. Among the 19 fertility treatment patients, 16 had received treatment with gonadotropins, 10 of which had surgically confirmed ovarian torsion. These ten patients had higher preoperative peak estradiol levels (3122 versus 1875 pg/mL, p = 0.05) and a larger ovarian diameter (9.7 versus 7.6 cm, p = 0.05) than the six patients receiving gonadotropins found to not have ovarian torsion. These results suggest infertility treatment using gonadotropins for ovarian hyperstimulation may be an independent risk factor for ovarian torsion as suggested by the disproportionate number of such individuals represented in the study population (9% of all patients, 84% of fertility patients). Additionally, among women taking gonadotropins, an association exists between peak estradiol levels, ovarian diameter, and risk for ovarian torsion."

The aims were (1) to evaluate and compare the surgically verified ovarian torsion cases in otherwise-normal ovaries and ovaries including a mass or cyst and (2) to investigate whether the normal-appearing ovaries on ultrasound examination affected the diagnosis of ovarian torsion or not. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study design was used. The medical records of all postmenarchal adolescent girls with surgically verified ovarian torsion treated in a university hospital from 2010 to 2016 were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-nine post-menarchal girls were identified. The subjects were divided into two groups. Eight girls (group 1) had ovarian torsion in a normal ovary, and twenty-one girls (group 2) had ovarian torsion including a mass or cyst. The median ages of group 1 and 2 were 13 and 14 years, respectively. Abdominal pain was the main presenting symptom for all cases in both groups. Doppler flow studies were abnormal in 6/9 (66.6%) in group 1 and 12/21 (57.1%) in group 2. The time from first admission to the operation was statistically longer in group 1 than in group 2 (34.5±24.3 hours vs. 19.5±9.2 hours, respectively; p=0.001). The longitudinal axis of uterine size was significantly shorter in group 1 than in group 2 (34.3±2.9 mm vs. 47.6±4.5 mm, respectively; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Ovarian torsion in adolescent girls can be seen within the otherwise-normal ovary. The normal-appearing ovaries on ultrasound in the emergency department may lead to delay in the diagnosis of ovarian torsion in adolescent girls."

Better endoscopic instruments and operational techniques have led to a great reduction in the number of abdominal hysterectomies. It is believed that LSH is a safe and minimally invasive hysterectomy technique. The Cochrane Database meta-analysis proves the benefits of minimally invasive surgery compared with abdominal gynaecological surgery, including decreased pain, surgical-site infections and hospital stay, quicker return to activity, and fewer postoperative adhesions. According to recent publications, the overall complication rate of all hysterectomy methods is about 1-4.5%. Adnexal torsion is a correlated complication. About 3-5% of patients undergoing emergency surgery due to pelvic pain are diagnosed with this condition. It may be the cause of acute abdomen and correlated symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, or severe pain. To the best of our knowledge a case of asymptomatic, delayed ovarian torsion mimicking ovarian tumour has not been reported so far. In the presented case, torsion successfully imitated neoplastic process as both ROMA score and IOTA 'simple rules' indicated a malignancy with high degree of probability. This case demonstrates that, if ovarian tumour is detected in the postoperative period, a torsion of ovarian pedicle should be taken into consideration as it may mimic malignant neoplasm."

    "title": "Abdominal Pain in the Post-menopausal Female: Is Ovarian Torsion in the Differential?",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is often thought of as a disease process of reproductive-aged women; however, it is also seen in the extremes of age. In post-menopausal women, it can be both a challenge to diagnose and associated with increased morbidity. We present a case of a 68-year-old woman with sudden onset of lower abdominal pain 6 h before arrival at the emergency department (ED). She was diagnosed with ovarian torsion, secondary to an ovarian mass, and underwent a full malignancy evaluation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Given the higher risk of malignancy in post-menopausal women, ovarian mass-related torsion is an uncommon but important cause of acute-onset lower abdominal pain. Due to the lower prevalence of ovarian torsion in the post-menopausal group, delayed or missed diagnosis is common and may increase associated morbidity. This morbidity is due to the increased likelihood of malignancy and complications of associated medical and surgical treatment of the mass. This report highlights the increased malignancy risk, difficulty with diagnosing torsion in the post-menopausal age group, and the rationale for different management strategies when compared to premenopausal women."

    "abstract": "To illustrate the laparoscopic surgical management of a particular localization of extrauterine pregnancy misdiagnosed until 12 weeks gestational age, complicated by hemoperitoneum and abortion. Canadian Task Force III on the Periodic Health Examination's Levels of Evidence. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy among women presenting to an emergency department with first trimester bleeding, pain, or both ranges from 1% to 16% [1]. The most common localization of ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tubes, whereas abdominal pregnancy accounts for at least 1% of extrauterine pregnancies. The reported incidence of abdominal pregnancy ranges from 1:10 000 to 1:30 000 pregnancies [2]. Abdominal pregnancy can be localized in the pelvic cul-de-sac, broad ligament, bowel, or pelvic sidewall. This rare type of ectopic pregnancy is often misdiagnosed until later in pregnancy, evolving in hemoperitoneum, abortion, embolism, or rarely, in diagnosed cases, live birth by cesarean section. In the literature, it is recommended that the placenta be left in situ in cases of abdominal pregnancy to avoid hemorrhage and organ injury, even though this approach may be associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications, such as infection, secondary bleeding, and cancer transformation [3]. We present a case of abdominal pregnancy in which the gestational sac was implanted in the broad ligament and resulted in hemoperitoneum at 12 weeks gestational age. In August 2010, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 1, presented at the Di Meglio ultrasound diagnostic center in Naples for a noninvasive prenatal ultrasound (bi-test) to confirm gestational age in what to that point had been considered a normal pregnancy at 12 weeks gestation. Ultrasound revealed an ectopic abdominal pregnancy with a live fetus located in the left parauterine side. A suspicious fluid level in the pouch Douglas was also detected, and so the woman was advised to go to an obstetric hospital for a medical evaluation of the clinical situation (starting hemoperitoneum). Later that same day, the woman presented at the Villa dei Platani Hospital in Avellino, where ultrasound confirmed increased fluid in the pouch of Douglas, along with initial signs of hemoperitoneum and loss of the fetal heartbeat. The woman was immediately transferred to the Malzoni Center for Advanced Endoscopic Gynecological Surgery in Avellino, where she underwent operative laparoscopy for removal of the abdominal pregnancy (surgeon, M.M.). Informed consent for the laparoscopic surgery was provided by the patient in accordance with local regulations. The patient also provided informed consent for the use of images and a video of the procedure. Institutional Review Board approval was not required. The procedure involved laparoscopic hemoperitoneum drainage (at least 500 mL of blood), left adnexectomy after transperitoneal identification of the left uretheral pathway, and complete removal of left broad ligament pregnancy abortion with consensual removal of the ectopic placenta. The laparoscopic management of abdominal pregnancy and hemoperitoneum resulting from rupture of the gestational chamber and abortion was optimal. With this minimally invasive technique, it was possible to drain the hemoperitoneum completely and then proceed to total removal of the gestational chamber and the fetus. Thanks to the magnification of the image by laparoscopy, it was also possible to completely remove the placenta and the cotyledons from the peritoneal surface, thereby avoiding possible postoperative bleeding, infection, and sepsis resulting from retention of incomplete removal of the placenta. On the first postoperative day, the patient was in excellent clinical condition, with a marked reduction in circulating β-human chorionic gonadotropin. She was discharged on the second postoperative day and currently is in good health."

A potentially life-threatening condition, ectopic pregnancy occurs in 1.5%-2% of pregnancies. Many patients will require either surgical or pharmacological intervention following a positive diagnosis. With regard to pharmacological options, methotrexate, largely known for its use in the oncology arena, has emerged as the most effective nonsurgical option and the pharmacological agent of choice. However, this therapy is not without its own unique adverse event profile and patients should be adequately educated on the monitoring parameters of this pharmacotherapy."

Case. 28-year-old G5P3105 at 10 weeks with a dichorionic diamniotic gestation was found to have a ruptured uterus with expulsion of a cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy and retention of the intrauterine fetus. After uterine repair, the singleton gestation reached viability was delivered by emergent cesarean section for placental abruption. Conclusion. Safe management of cesarean ectopic pregnancy requires early diagnosis by ultrasonography. With early detection, management can focus on preventing maternal morbidity of uterine rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage."

We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 1009 girls between the ages of 5-18 years who presented to our pediatric emergency department (PED) with pelvic pain and therefore underwent pelvic ultrasound examination between June 2011 and May 2014. In total, 132 of 1009 girls (13.1%) were identified as having ovarian cysts ≥1 cm in diameter. The frequency of ovarian cysts was found to be 1.8% (6/337) in children aged 5-9 years and 18.8% (126/672) in those aged 10-18 years. All the cysts detected in children aged 5-9 years were small (<3 cm) and simple with age-specific frequencies ranging between 1.5-2.7%. With the onset of adolescence, ovarian cyst frequency started to increase with age and ranged between 3.8-31.3% throughout adolescence. Age of peak ovarian cyst frequency was 15 years with a rate of 31.3%. Large ovarian cysts (>5 cm) were identified in 19 adolescents (15.1%) with most occurring during middle adolescence. Of the 19 adolescents, five were found to have cyst-related significant ovarian pathologies including cystadenoma (n=3) and ovarian torsion (n=2). In children aged 5-9 years, ovarian cysts were infrequent and small (<3 cm). Peak ovarian cyst frequency was detected at the age of 15 years. All patients diagnosed with cyst-related significant ovarian pathologies were adolescents having a cyst >5 cm in diameter with a complex appearance in most."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a rare but serious cause of pelvic pain in females. Making the diagnosis is important because misdiagnosis can lead to an ischemic ovary and subsequent infertility. Although all emergency physicians are aware of ovarian torsion, there are several myths regarding its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This article attempts to review some of these myths to improve emergency diagnosis and evaluation. Ovarian torsion is not an easy diagnosis to make and it is commonly missed. Signs and symptoms often mimic other disorders such as appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis becomes more challenging in that torsion can occur in female patients of all ages, including infants and the elderly. Normal arterial blood flow on ultrasound does not rule out ovarian torsion and not every patient will have a mass on imaging or a palpable mass on examination. Patients may have symptoms for several hours or days, and thus, ovarian torsion may be present even with a longer duration of symptoms. Surgery is the definitive treatment and may still be effective after several hours of symptoms. Although ovarian torsion is a challenging diagnosis, understanding myths surrounding the disorder may help emergency physicians consider it in unusual populations. If there is any clinical concern for ovarian torsion, a gynecologic consult may be helpful, even if imaging findings are not conclusive. Surgery remains the standard method for definitive diagnosis and treatment."

In this Phase III study, 2885 nulliparous and parous women aged 18-35 years were randomized to LNG-IUS 8 or LNG-IUS 12 for 3 years. After 3 years, women using LNG-IUS 12 could continue for up to 2 additional years (5 years total). The primary outcome was occurrence of pregnancy (Pearl Index). Secondary outcomes included safety, bleeding, dysmenorrhea, discontinuations, and user satisfaction. From August 2007 through May 2008, out of 2885 women who were enrolled, 1453 were randomized to LNG-IUS 12. Placement was attempted in 1452/1453 (full analysis set). Mean age at baseline was 27.1 years; 39.5% were nulliparous. The cumulative 5-year Pearl Index (PI) was 0.29; the 5-year cumulative failure rate was 1.4%. The 5-year PI for ectopic pregnancy was 0.18. Over 5 years, 55.3% of women reported study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Crude incidences of pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine perforation, and complete/partial LNG-IUS 12 expulsion were 0.6%, 0.2%, and 3.7%, respectively. Women using LNG-IUS 12 generally experienced less frequent bleeding over time. The incidence of amenorrhea during the last 90-day reference interval (end of Year 5) was 22.6%. Overall, 870 (59.9%) and 550 (37.9%) women completed 3 and 5 years of treatment, respectively; 77.8% of women who entered the extension phase completed 5 years of use. Over 5 years, 22.6% discontinued due to TEAEs, including 13 women who discontinued due to pregnancy; 76 discontinued due to bleeding problems including amenorrhea; and 163 discontinued due to desire for pregnancy, 71.2% of whom conceived within 12 months. In this study including parous and nulliparous women, LNG-IUS 12 was highly effective over 5 years of use and associated with a favorable safety profile.

To review all cases of EP and determine the incidence of EP. To study the high risk factors and know the types of clinical presentation, methods of diagnosis, outcome and complications. This was a retrospective cohort study, conducted at a tertiary care medical teaching hospital in Pondicherry, India. Medical records of all women with an EP between 2009 and 2015 were retrieved. Demographic data, parity, risk factors, clinical features, mode of management and need for blood transfusion was noted. Main outcome measures studied were the incidence of EP, risk factors, mortality and morbidity in these women. Data was entered in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysed using SPSS software version 19.0. For categorical variables, data was compiled as frequency and percent. For continuous variables, data was calculated as mean ± SD. Seventy-two EP were diagnosed during the six-year period with an incidence of 9.1/1000 pregnancies. Majority of women were aged 21-30years (51.39%), 27.8% women were nulliparous. The most common risk factors were previous abortion (36.1%) and pelvic surgery (37.50%). Fifteen cases (20.8%) were diagnosed in women who had tubectomy. The classic triad of lower abdominal pain, amenorrhoea and vaginal bleeding was seen in 29(40.3%) cases. Ultrasonography was required to arrive at a diagnosis in 28(38.9%) cases. Urine pregnancy test was positive in 100% of cases. Majority (94.4%) were tubal ectopic pregnancies. Medical management with methotrexate alone benefitted 10(13.89%) of patients while another four required surgery for failed medical management. More than half of the patients (59.7%) required blood transfusion and two (2.8%) had transfusion related acute lung injury. No deaths were noted. Common risk factors for EP must be identified. Use of transvaginal ultrasonography and human chorionic gonadotropin assay have revolutionised the management of EP and serve as valuable adjuncts to early diagnosis and management."

Our objective was to develop and validate decision rules for the diagnosis of EP, in patients in their first trimester of pregnancy with symptoms, based solely on a self-assessment questionnaire. From September 2006 to March 2008, 574 patients, who have consulted for acute pelvic pain at the gynecologic emergency department (ED) of five hospitals, completed a Self-Assessment Questionnaire for Gynecological Emergencies (SAQ-GE). We included for our study only women in their first trimester of pregnancy experiencing acute pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding who were hospitalized (262 patients). Two-thirds of patients were selected to derive the SAQ-GE EP score which was built on multiple logistic regression. One third of patients were used for internal validation. Five variables were independently and significantly (p<0.05) associated with EP: no frequent need to change sanitary towels (aDOR = 6.1; 95% CI [2.1-17.8]), duration of bleeding > 24 hours (aDOR = 4,3; 95% CI [1,7-11,0]), pain during coughing (aDOR = 3.1; CI 95% [1,4-6,7]), brown discharge (aDOR = 3.0; 95% CI [1.3-7.1]) and unilateral pelvic pain (aDOR = 2.7; 95% CI [1.3-5.9]). The SAQ-GE ectopic pregnancy score was based on these five criteria with values ranging from 0 to 100. The low-risk group of EP (score<25) had a sensitivity of 95.9% 95% CI [89.8-98,9] and an LR- of 0.2 95% CI [0.1-0.5]. The high-risk group (score>70) had a specificity of 97.4 95% CI [90.9-99.7] and a LR+ of 12.3 95% CI [3.0-49.8]. The percentages of EP observed in the validation sample were: 0% in the low-risk group and 88.9% in the high-risk group. These prediction rules that classify patients in a low-risk or high-risk group may prove useful for triaging pregnant women in their first trimester with symptoms before complementary exams."

    "abstract": "Updated clinical recommendations for medical induced abortion procedure. A systematic review of French and English literature, reviewing the evidence relating to the provision of medical induced abortion was carried out on PubMed, Cochrane Library and international scientific societies recommendations. The effectiveness of medical abortion is higher than 95% when the protocols are adjusted to gestational age (EL1). Misoprostol alone is less effective than a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol (EL1). Gemeprost is less effective than misoprostol (EL2). The dose of 200mg of mifepristone should be preferred to 600mg (NP1, Rank A). Mifepristone can be taken at home (professional agreement). The optimum interval between mifepristone and misoprostol intake should be 24 to 48 hours (EL1, grade A). Before 7 weeks LMP, the dose of 400μg misoprostol should be given orally (EL1, grade A) eventually repeated after 3hours if no bleeding occurs. For optimal effectiveness between 7 and 14 LMP, the interval between mifepristone and misoprostol should not be shortened to less than 8hours (grade 1). An interval of 24 to 48hours will not affect the effectiveness of the method provided misoprostol dosage is 800μg (EL1). Vaginal, sublingual or buccal routes of administration are more effective and better tolerated than the oral route, which should be abandoned (EL1). An amount of 800μg sublingual or buccal misoprostol route has the same effectiveness than the vaginal route but more gastrointestinal side effects (EL1, grade A). Between 7 and 9 LMP, it does not seem necessary to repeat misoprostol dose whereas it should be repeated beyond 9 SA (grade B). Between 9 and 14 LMP, the dose of 400μg misoprostol given either vaginally, buccally or sublingually should be repeated every 3hours if needed (with a maximum of 5 doses) (EL2, grade B). There is no strong evidence supporting routine antibiotic prophylaxis for medical abortion (professional agreement). Rare contraindications should be respected (known hypersensitivity to misoprostol or mifepristone, inherited porphyria, severe anemia, hemorrhagic disorders or current anticoagulation therapy, suspected or confirmed ectopic pregnancy) as well as precautions of use (severe disease or on-going corticosteroid therapy). With no risk factors or symptoms, a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) at the endovaginal ultrasound associated with a level of hCG usually chosen at less than 1500IU (or 2500IU with an abdominal probe) is not a contraindication of medical abortion as long as the woman is informed of the risk of undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy and knows how and when to seek emergency attention. An earlier than usual follow-up of the decrease of hCG levels is highly recommended. Breastfeeding, obesity, twin pregnancy and scared uterus are not contraindications for first trimester medical abortion. Side effects (gastro intestinal and thermoregulation disorders) during the procedure are generally of low intensity and short duration. A prophylactic treatment for nausea should be proposed (professional agreement). The pain increases with gestational age of the pregnancy (EL1). Ibuprofen is the first choice of painkiller (EL1). Ibuprofen will be systematically proposed or given on demand according to the practice of each facility (professional agreement). After a medical abortion, a follow-up assessment to confirm completion of the abortion is recommended (EL2, grade B). Clinical history combined with ultrasound and/or hCG blood level are both reliable methods and can be left with the choice of each facility (grade B). A fall of more than 80% of the initial blood level of hCG, fifteen days after the procedure is in favor of the success of the method (grade B). Medical abortion is a safe and efficient abortion method up to 14 weeks LMP. To be effective, the drug regimen should be adapted to gestational age. Women should be informed of advantages and disadvantages of the method according to the gestational age and side effects so she can choose the method that fits her best."

A total of 4881 articles relevant to EP were retrieved in the database of the Science Citation Index Expanded from 1965 to present, in which the 100 top-cited articles were selected for further analysis. The number of citations ranged from 81 to 482 (131.57 ± 69.76), with a time span of 40 years between 1969 and 2009. These citation classics came from 14 countries, and 65 of the articles came from the United States. Yale University in Connecticut led the list of classics with six papers. The 100 top-cited articles were published in 32 journals, in which the journal of Fertility and Sterility published the most (23 papers). Stovall TG and Ling FW published the highest number of studies (6 papers each). Articles that originated in the United States and that were published in high-impact journals were most likely to be cited in the field of EP research. Bibliometric analysis was used to provide a historical perspective on the progress in EP research over the past 50 years. Citation analysis is a feasible tool to comprehensively recognize the advances of EP research in the past and future research."

    "abstract": "Upper abdominal pregnancy is rare. Most patients present with hemoperitoneum, requiring emergency laparotomy. A 32-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain and an elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level. Ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and laparoscopy failed to locate the source of elevated hCG. Subsequent positron emission tomography (PET)-CT demonstrated a cystic mass in the left pararenal region with no increased uptake. Repeated ultrasound scan revealed a live fetus implanted laterally to the abdominal aorta. After failing to respond to methotrexate at the usual dosage, a regimen used in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia was given. The pregnancy underwent miscarriage afterwards, and the hCG level gradually returned to normal. The site of an ectopic pregnancy should be sought thoroughly to avoid missing an abdominal pregnancy and hence disastrous hemoperitoneum. While medical therapy with high-dose methotrexate is not a standard treatment, it can be considered after failing the traditional therapy, provided that there is adequate treatment monitoring and expertise in handling the side effects of the medication."

Our IRB-approved, retrospective study evaluated 780 patients between August 2012 and February 2016 with ovarian torsion as a diagnostic consideration on the emergency department note. Patients were included if they had preoperative MRI and intraoperatively confirmed case of ovarian torsion. MRIs were retrospectively reviewed for presence of perifollicular T2 hypointense rim in the torsed ovary. Two arms of analysis were performed: (a) assessment of perifollicular hemorrhage on histological exam; and (b) assessment of ovarian viability after intra-operative detorsion. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of MRI for predicting ovarian viability in the setting of torsion was performed. κ test assessed level of agreement between readers. 24 patients included in one of the two arms; 20 in viability analysis and 12 in perifollicular hemorrhage analysis (8 in both). The presence of T2-hypointense rim on MRI demonstrated 88.9% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity for the diagnosis of perifollicular hemorrhage on histology, and 91.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity for predicting intraoperative viability. The presence of a perifollicular T2 hypointense rim on MRI in the setting of ovarian torsion correlates with perifollicular hemorrhage on histopathologic exam, and may also be a useful predictor of ovarian viability in patients presenting with ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "A woman presented at the gynecological emergency clinic with severe lower abdominal pain. Even though she reported normal menses and had no risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy test was positive and vaginal sonogram indicated heterotopic pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestation, with rupture of the ectopic pregnancy. Laboratory results indicated significant blood loss, and emergency laparotomy with salpingo-ophorectomy was performed. The intrauterine pregnancy continued uneventfully. Interestingly, the previous month the patient had also undergone investigation for vague abdominal pain and anemia. This case, apart from being very interesting because of the rarity of naturally occurring heterotopic pregnancy, shows how a number of factors in patient management and investigation, when combined with rare and uncommon conditions, can lead to incorrect diagnosis with the associated implications for patient safety. This case therefore demonstrates the need for improved patient care and outcome."

A 33-year-old female status post SKPTx suddenly got abdominal pain in the lower level. She had high human chorionic Gonadotropin test. Ultrasonography revealed that there was no fetus in the uterus but a dilated right fallopian tube, which strongly suggested ectopic pregnancy. An emergency operation was performed and a dilated right side uterine tube was found with adhesions to her transplant. Salpingectomy was performed and no visible injury to the pancreas was found by the procedure. Pathological evaluation showed ectopic pregnant fetus, and no pancreas dysfunction was observed after the operation. This is the first case and operation report of EP after SKPTx. We should consider various causes of acute abdomen as well as several pathological condition in the transplanted pancreas such as pancreatitis, abscess, and thrombosis in vessels in the organ. Moreover, transplanted pancreas in abdomen is easily misrecognized as adipose tissue and there is high risk that the organ to get injured surgically. EP should be included in the different diagnosis in SKPTx female patients who get acute abdominal pain. It is highly desirable that transplant surgeon is included in the operation team for EP of these patients."

    "abstract": "Extra-uterine pregnancy or Ectopic Pregnancy (EP) is a major health problem for pregnant women, presenting as a potentially life-threatening emergency in the first trimester. There are three major options for the treatment of EP: expectant management, surgical treatment and medical management. The presence of free intraperitoneal fluid in EP-diagnosed patients is crucial for treatment planning and evaluation. To compare the outcomes of both the expectant man-agement and medical treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in ectopic pregnancies with free intraperitoneal fluid. This retrospective cohort study inclu-ded a total of 91 ectopic pregnancies with or without rupture in which the women had initial free intraperitoneal fluid and were haemodynamically stable. Serial β-HCG measurements were used to assess the outcome of expectant management and medical treatment with MTX. For the statistical analysis, the SPSS statistical software package, version 22.0 (Chicago, IL, USA), was used. For the quantitative variables that were not distributed normally, the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Mann-Whitney U test were performed for the evaluation of differences between the groups. It was observed that the success rate with expectant management was 81% (initial β HCG concentration 626±443 mIU/mL). With a single dose of MTX, it was 76% (initial β HCG concentration 2124±1647 mIU/mL) and with a total single or double dose of MTX, it was 88% (initial β HCG concentration 2252±78 mIU/mL) from among EP with or without rupture in women with initial free intraperitoneal fluid during diagnosis. There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to ultrasonography findings. Expectant management or medical treatment with methotrexate should be the first line treatment for ectopic pregnancies with initial free intraperitoneal fluid, albeit with rupture, in patients who are haemodynamically stable, along with β-HCG follow-up."

    "abstract": "Representing an ascending, sexually spread pyogenic infection of the female genital tract, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a commonly encountered cause for emergency visits and hospitalizations among young and adult female patients. Though gynecologic evaluation and sonography constitute the mainstay of diagnosis, multidetector CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is not uncommonly performed, often as the initial imaging modality, due to the frequently vague and indeterminate clinical presentation. As such, knowledge and attenuation to the often subtle early imaging features of PID afford the radiologist a critical chance to direct and expedite appropriate pathways of patient care, minimizing the risk for secondary complications, including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and enteric adhesions. In this paper, we will review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, early and late imaging features of PID as well as potential secondary complications and treatment options. Additionally, we will discuss published data metrics on CT performance regarding sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis as well as potential imaging differential diagnostic considerations."

Hemostasis of the resected stump is critical for the success of laparoscopic treatment. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. We suspected a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and performed urgent diagnostic laparoscopy. The gestational sac was implanted in the posterior wall of the uterus near the left uterosacral ligament, and bleeding from the gestational sac was noticed. We injected 3 ml of diluted vasopressin solution (0.4 U/ml) directly into the gestational sac and into the posterior uterine wall around the gestational sac. Thereafter, we could resect the gestational product using an ultrasonically activated scalpel. Additional hemostasis in the resected stump was not required. CONCLUSIONS We believe that a local injection of a diluted vasopressin solution helps in maintaining the hemostasis after the laparoscopic resection of the implanted gestational sac in cases of abdominal pregnancy."

    "abstract": "How do four protocols based on serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements perform when classifying pregnancies of unknown location (PULs) as low or high risk of being an ectopic pregnancy (EP)? The use of cut-offs in hCG level changes published by NICE, and a logistic regression model, M4, correctly classify more PULs as high risk, compared with two other protocols. A logistic regression model, M4, based on the mean of two consecutive hCG values and the hCG ratio (hCG 48 h/hCG 0 h) that classify PULs into low- and high-risk groups for triage purposes, identifies more EPs than a protocol using the cut-offs between a 13% decline and a 66% rise in hCG levels over 48 h. A retrospective comparative study of four different hCG-based protocols classifying PULs as low or high risk of being an EP was performed at a gynaecological emergency unit over 3 years. We identified 915 women with a PUL. Initial transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) findings categorised 187 of the PULs as probable intrauterine pregnancies (IUPs) and 16 as probable EPs. The rate of change in hCG levels over 48 h was calculated for each patient and subjected to three different hCG threshold intervals and a logistic regression model for outcome prediction. Each PUL was subsequently dichotomised to either low-risk (i.e. failed PUL/IUP) or high-risk (i.e. EP) classification, which allowed us to compare the diagnostic performance. In 'Protocol A', a PUL was classified as low risk if >13% hCG level decline or >66% hCG level rise was achieved; otherwise, the PUL was classified as high risk of being an EP. 'Protocol B' classified a PUL as low or high risk using cut-offs of 35-50% declining hCG levels and of 53% rising hCG levels. Similarly, 'Protocol C' used hCG level cut-offs published by NICE, 50% for declining hCG levels and 63% for rising hCG levels. Finally, if a logistic regression model 'Protocol M4' calculated a ≥5% risk of the PUL being an EP, it was classified as high risk, and otherwise the PUL was classified as low risk. When the time interval between two hCG measurements failed to meet an exact 48 h, extrapolation and interpolation of hCG values was made, using log linear transformation. Protocols A, B, C and M4 classified 73, 66, 55 and 56% of PULs as low risk. The sensitivity for protocols A, B, C and M4 was 68% (95% confidence interval (CI) 61-75%), 81% (74-86%), 87% (82-92%) and 88% (83-93%), respectively. The specificity was 82% (80-85%), 77% (74-80%), 66% (62-69%) and 67% (63-70%) for protocols A, B, C and M4, respectively. All comparisons of sensitivity and specificity between the protocols were statistically significant except for protocol C versus protocol M4. In protocol C, 87% (66-97%) of misclassified EPs had rising hCG levels, compared with 19% (6-41%) for protocol M4 (P < 0.01). In a secondary analysis excluding probable IUPs and probable EPs, the results for 712 PULs were analysed. The sensitivity subsequently remained stable for all protocols. Protocol M4 reached a 78% (74-81%) specificity, which was significantly higher than 70% (66-74%) for protocol C (P = 0.01) and protocol M4 classified 63% of PULs as low risk compared with 58% for protocol C. The retrospective design of the study is a limitation. The results are derived from a population where laparoscopy played an important role in PUL management and diagnosis of EPs, although it did reflect real clinical practice. Although we tried to adhere to definitions of PUL and final outcomes as in previous studies and a recent consensus statement, potential differences in this regard must be acknowledged. Where the time interval between two serial hCG measurements deviated from 48 h we estimated 48 h hCG values. A logistic regression model, M4, classifies more PULs correctly as low risk in a selected PUL population without probable IUPs and EPs and identifies as many EPs, in comparison with the cut-offs available in the NICE guideline. This advantage for model M4 may result in a reduction of unnecessary follow-up visits, when fewer low-risk PULs are misclassified as high risk. These findings, however, ought to be clarified in a randomised controlled trial. The study was supported by LUA/ALF grant No. 70940. There are no competing interests."

Video case report, with step-by-step explanation of the procedure (Canadian Task Force classification III) SETTING: CSP may be treated by different approaches including surgery and methotrexate. Successful methotrexate treatments avoid an emergency surgical treatment. In these cases a residual CSP often remains and should be removed in women who desire to conceive. CSP is often associated with a cesarean section scar defect called an isthmocele. In case of isthmocele with important defect and desire for pregnancy, laparoscopic repair may be proposed. Diagnosis and treatment of isthmocele is usually performed in a second time after a successful treatment of CSP. In this case, a surgical treatment including the removal of the residual CSP and treatment of the isthmocele may be proposed. In this video we describe a technique for the surgical removal of residual CSP and isthmocele treatment by robotic-assisted laparoscopy. A 32-year-old patient developed a CSP treated by 2 in situ injections of methotrexate. A magnetic resonance imaging study performed 1 month after the last methotrexate injection revealed a persistent 4-cm residual CSP, associated with an isthmocele. Preoperative uterine artery embolization was performed to reduce intraoperative bleeding. After localization of the residual CSP on the left side, a temporary left uterine occlusion was performed. Residual CSP was totally removed. The residual defect and isthmocele were closed using delayed absorbable suture. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic removal of residual CSP and isthmocele treatment is a feasible and safe procedure. This procedure may be proposed in patients presenting with this condition after a methotrexate treatment of CSP."

    "abstract": "Up to 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, which can be a significant life event for women with psychological implications. Because the only preventative measure for a miscarriage is risk factor modification, the treatment focuses on confirming the miscarriage has occurred and medical management of symptoms. Although women experiencing a miscarriage are frequently directed to seek medical care in emergency departments, the patients are often triaged as nonemergent patients unless they are unstable, which exposes women to potentially prolonged wait times. Research about miscarriages and emergency departments predominantly focus on medical management with little understanding of how emergency care shapes the experience of miscarriage for women. Seeking to describe the experiences of women coming to the emergency department for care while having a miscarriage, interpretive phenomenology-a form of qualitative research-guided this study. Eight women were recruited to participate in semi-structured face-to-face interviews of 60 to 90 minutes in length. Data were analyzed using hermeneutics and thematic analysis. Five themes emerged: \"Pregnant/Life: Miscarriage/Death\"; \"Deciding to go to the emergency department: Something's wrong\"; \"Not an illness: A different kind of trauma\"; \"Need for acknowledgement\"; and \"Leaving the emergency department: What now?\". Participants believed their losses were not acknowledged but instead dismissed. These experiences, combined with a perceived lack of discharge education and clarity regarding follow-up, created experiences of marginalization. This study describes the experience of miscarrying in emergency departments and provides insights regarding how nursing and physician care may affect patient perceptions of marginalization."

A high level of suspicion is paramount for early recognition and mitigation of acute compartment syndrome originating from prolonged surgery in lithotomy position. A 23-year-old female, gravida 1, para 0, underwent a laparoscopic salpingectomy for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Surgical time was 90 min. Postoperatively, the patient developed acute compartment syndrome of both legs necessitating emergent bilateral four-compartment fasciotomies, with repeated returns to the operating room for 2nd look procedures and delayed wound closures. The patient regained full function within 3 months and returned to an unrestricted baseline activity level. Technical diligence in applying a lithotomy position is paramount for preventing postoperative lower extremity compartment syndrome.

Four units of red blood cells concentrate and six units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused. Within two hours of surgery acute respiratory distress symptoms occurred, bilateral infiltrates were found on chest X-ray. The patient responded to supportive treatment (oxygen therapy, dexamethasone, diuretics) and her state improved within 12 hours. Serological diagnostics revealed anti-HLA antibodies in one donor which reacted with patient's granulocytes.

We estimate the association between diagnosed chlamydia and episodes of hospital health care (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department) for a reproductive complication. We constructed and analysed a retrospective population-based cohort of women aged 15-44 years from administrative records in Denmark (1995-2012). We used a subset of the national Danish Chlamydia Study. The master dataset contains all residents of Denmark (including Greenland) who had a positive chlamydia test recorded by a public health microbiology laboratory from Jan 1, 1992, to Nov 2, 2011. Individuals were randomly matched (by age and sex) to four individuals drawn from the population register (Danish Civil Registration System) who did not have a positive chlamydia test during this interval. The outcomes in the study were hospital episodes of health-care (inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department) with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, or tubal factor infertility. The 516 720 women (103 344 positive, 182 879 negative, 230 497 never-tested) had a mean follow-up of 7·96 years. Compared with women with only negative tests, the risk of each complication was 30% higher in women with one or more positive tests (pelvic inflammatory disease, adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1·50 [95% CI 1·43-1·57]; ectopic pregnancy, AHR 1·31 [1·25-1·38]; tubal factor infertility, AHR 1·37 [1·24-1·52]) and 60% lower in women who were never-tested (pelvic inflammatory disease, AHR 0·33 [0·31-0·35]; ectopic pregnancy, AHR 0·42 [0·39-0·44]; tubal factor infertility AHR 0·29 [0·25-0·33]). A positive test had a minor absolute impact on health as the difference in the lifetime incidence of complications was small between women who tested positive and those who tested negative (pelvic inflammatory disease, 0·6%; ectopic pregnancy, 0·2%; tubal factor infertility, 0·1%). Repeat infections increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease by a further 20% (AHR 1·20, 95% CI 1·11-1·31). A single diagnosed chlamydia infection increased the risk of all complications and a repeat diagnosed infection further increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, control programmes must prevent first and repeat infections to improve women's reproductive health. Unrestricted partial funding from Frederiksberg Kommune, Frederiksberg, Denmark.

From January 2005 to December 2015, 32 pediatric patients were surgically treated for 32 ovarian tumors: 28 (87.5%) benign and 4 (12.5%) malignant neoplastic lesions. Median age at surgery was 11.2 years (12.8 years in patients with benign neoplasms, 7.25 years in patients with malignant ones). All patients with malignant and 25% of patients with benign ovarian lesions had elevated serum level of tumors markers. The surgical approach was laparotomic in 62.5% and laparoscopic in 37.5%; 81.2% surgeries were performed in elective surgery and 18.8% in emergency. Intraoperative frozen section analysis was performed in 18.75% of patients. The most frequent surgery (96.8%) was unilateral oophorectomy. After a median follow-up of 76 months (range 6-132 months), 31/32 patients are alive and disease-free. In case of malignant tumors, fertility-sparing surgery with accurate staging must be performed. Laparoscopic multiport is the gold standard approach for benign pediatric ovarian neoplasms, but the use of laparoscopy in full respect of oncological principles also for early stage malignant tumors is currently increased."

The complaints of the patients at presentation, their age, gestational week and the β-HCG levels were found to be inefficient in predicting ruptured EPs. TVUSG was found statistically significant in terms of demonstrating ruptures in EP. The ratio of salpingectomies was observed to be higher in the surgical treatment of ruptured EPs. C-section was most frequently seen with EP. There is no absolute diagnostic parameter for predicting ruptured EPs and TVUSG may be a clue for diagnosis. The final diagnosis is made through surgery."

Detecting bilateral tubal ectopic pregnancy is urgent because of the associated morbidity and mortality. The appropriate fertility-preserving surgery must also be considered, as preservation of both tubes is presumed to offer better fertility prospects. Case Report: A 39-year-old gravida 2, para 1 presented with vaginal bleeding at 8 + 4 weeks of gestation. An approximately 18 mm adnexal mass in the right fallopian tube was detected on ultrasound. Laparoscopy was performed because ectopic pregnancy was suspected. This suspicion was confirmed during laparoscopy; the right fallopian tube was found to contain a mass measuring 20 mm in the isthmic part. Ultrasound of the left fallopian tube also showed a mass in the ampullary region (diameter: 10 mm), also suspicious for ectopic pregnancy. Bilateral salpingotomy was performed laparoscopically. Pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. Conclusions for Practice: Although ectopic tubal pregnancy is seen more often after assisted reproductive techniques, bilateral spontaneous ectopic pregnancies must also be considered in other cases. Laparoscopic surgery is effective to confirm the diagnosis and treat heterotopic pregnancies. Further studies will be needed to confirm whether unilateral or bilateral conservative fertility-preserving surgery is more appropriate. Zielsetzung: Bilaterale extrauterine Schwangerschaften sind rar und kommen mit einer Häufigkeit von nur 1 auf 200 000 Schwangerschaften vor. Wegen der damit verbundenen mütterlichen Morbidität und Mortalität ist ein frühzeitiges Erkennen dringend geboten. Wichtig ist die Wahl des operativen Eingriffs im Hinblick auf weitere Schwangerschaften, da die Erhaltung beider Eileiter sich fertilitätserhaltend auswirken kann. Fallbericht: Eine 39-jährige II. Gravida/I. Para stellte sich mit vaginaler Blutung in der 8. +4 SSW vor. Bei der Ultraschalluntersuchung wurde eine ungefähr 18 mm große Masse im rechten Eileiter entdeckt. Der Verdacht einer Tubargravidität lag nahe. Dieser Verdacht wurde in der anschließenden Laparoskopie bestätigt; im isthmischen Abschnitt des rechten Eileiters wurde eine Masse mit einem Durchmesser von 20 mm gefunden. Der Ultraschall des linken Eileiters zeigte eine Masse im ampullären Teil mit einem Durchmesser von 10 mm, die ebenfalls verdächtig auf eine Tubargravidität war. Eine bilaterale Salpingotomie wurde laparoskopisch durchgeführt. Der pathologische Befund hat die Diagnose bestätigt. Fazit für die Praxis: Obwohl Extrauteringravidität verstärkt nach assistierten Reproduktionstechniken auftritt, sollte spontane bilaterale Extrauteringravidität auch in anderen Fällen in Betracht gezogen werden. Die Laparoskopie wird zur Bestätigung der Diagnose sowie zur Behandlung heterotoper Schwangerschaften eingesetzt. Weitere Studien sind nötig, um festzustellen, ob sich ein einseitiger oder ein bilateraler konservativer Eingriff besser zum Fertilitätserhalt eignet."

    "abstract": "Rupture of a gravid uterus is an obstetric emergency. Risks factors include a scarred uterus but also spontaneous rupture of an un- scarred uterus during pregnancy is possible. The authors present two cases of a spontaneous complete uterine rupture during pregnancy. The first case had only a past history of dilatation and curettage for abortion; the second case had a past history of dilatation and curettage for abortion and a monolateral laparoscopic salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy. They presented with abdominal pain and after ultrasound scan, uterine ruptures were diagnosed. These cases show that there should be a high index of suspicious of uterine rupture in a gravid woman with a history of curettage for the possible presence of misunderstood uterine scar and in women with a past history of salpingectomy with or without corneal resection. Appropriate counseling and close follow-up might help to avoid such obstetrical catastrophes. To provide more insight into the possible risk factors for prelabor uterine rupture in pregnancy, a literature review was performed."

    "abstract": "Interstitial pregnancy (IP) occurs within the intramural portion of the tube and accounts for 2% of ectopic pregnancies. Surgery is considered the most definitive treatment for IPs, although there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal approach. In this paper we describe the advantages of cornual resection performed using the Endoloop technique and present three patients who were successfully treated using this approach. IP diagnosis was confirmed at two and three-dimensional ultrasound and laparoscopy in all cases. Fertility sparing surgery with cornuectomy by Endoloop ligature technique demonstrated low mean operating time and blood loss, and allowed the quick recovery and discharge of all patients. Laparoscopy has become the gold standard surgical approach for IP. Cornual resection or excision is the most commonly performed procedure. In our case series, the Endoloop technique showed excellent treatment outcomes in terms of effectiveness, blood loss, operative time, recovery and post-procedure fertility. Because of these features, Endoloop appears to be a suitable option for the laparoscopic management of IPs, both in elective and emergency settings."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify predictors of the outcome and clinical efficacy of emergency pelvic artery embolisation (PAE) for primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) and to assess the post-embolisation fertility of PAE patients in a regional hospital setting. A 12-year retrospective study of patients undergoing emergency PAE was conducted at a regional acute general hospital. Clinical and procedural parameters, clinical outcomes and post-embolisation pregnancy success rates were analysed. There were 47,221 deliveries at the hospital during the study period, of which 33 patients required urgent PAE for primary PPH. The technical success rate of embolisation was 97.0% (n = 32). Clinically adequate haemostasis was achieved by a single embolisation procedure in 24 (72.7%) patients; the remaining eight eventually required surgery to achieve cessation of bleeding. Among the parameters studied, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that pre-embolisation platelet count (p = 0.036) and maternal age (p = 0.019) were the only significant independent predictors of embolisation failure. Only two patients successfully conceived after PAE, although one of them had an ectopic pregnancy. Emergency PAE is an effective measure to arrest life-threatening bleeding in patients with primary PPH. As low pre-embolisation platelet count and advanced maternal age are associated with higher odds of embolisation failure, careful post-embolisation monitoring may be required for such patients. Embolisation also allows subsequent pregnancy. However, further studies are required to assess the outcomes of post-embolisation pregnancies."

    "abstract": "The application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy faced initial skepticism of physicians because of fetal safety concerns. The perceived fetal risk has been found to be unwarranted and of late, the modality has attained acceptability. Its role in diagnosing fetal anomalies is well recognized and following its safety certification in pregnancy, it is finding increasing utilization during pregnancy and puerperium. However, the use of MRI in maternal emergency obstetric conditions is relatively limited as it is still evolving. In early gestation, ectopic implantation is one of the major life-threatening conditions that are frequently encountered. Although ultrasound (USG) is the accepted mainstay modality, the diagnostic predicament persists in many cases. MRI has a role where USG is indeterminate, particularly in the extratubal ectopic pregnancy. Later in gestation, MRI can be a useful adjunct in placental disorders like previa, abruption, and adhesion. It is a good problem-solving tool in adnexal masses such as ovarian torsion and degenerated fibroid, which have a higher incidence during pregnancy. Catastrophic conditions like uterine rupture can also be preoperatively and timely diagnosed. MRI has a definite role to play in postpartum and post-abortion life-threatening conditions, e.g., retained products of conception, and gestational trophoblastic disease, especially when USG is inconclusive or inadequate."

    "title": "Canadian Contraception Consensus (Part 3 of 4): Chapter 7--Intrauterine Contraception.",
    "abstract": "To provide guidelines for health care providers on the use of contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy and on the promotion of healthy sexuality. Overall efficacy of cited contraceptive methods, assessing reduction in pregnancy rate, safety, ease of use, and side effects; the effect of cited contraceptive methods on sexual health and general well-being; and the relative cost and availability of cited contraceptive methods in Canada. Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline and The Cochrane Database from January 1994 to January 2015 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., contraception, sexuality, sexual health) and key words (e.g., contraception, family planning, hormonal contraception, emergency contraception). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies published in English from January 1994 to January 2015. Searches were updated on a regular basis in incorporated in the guideline to June 2015. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. The quality of the evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). CHAPTER 7: INTRAUTERINE CONTRACEPTION: 1. Intrauterine contraceptives are as effective as permanent contraception methods. (II-2) 2. The use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) 52 mg by patients taking tamoxifen is not associated with recurrence of breast cancer. (I) 3. Intrauterine contraceptives have a number of noncontraceptive benefits. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) 52 mg significantly decreases menstrual blood loss (I) and dysmenorrhea. (II-2) Both the copper intrauterine device and the LNG-IUS significantly decrease the risk of endometrial cancer. (II-2) 4. The risk of uterine perforation decreases with inserter experience but is higher in postpartum and breastfeeding women. (II-2) 5. The risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is increased slightly in the first month after intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) insertion, but the absolute risk is low. Exposure to sexually transmitted infections and not the IUC itself is responsible for PID occurring after the first month of use. (II-2) 6. Nulliparity is not associated with an increased risk of intrauterine contraceptive expulsion. (II-2) 7. Ectopic pregnancy with an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) is rare, but when a pregnancy occurs with an IUC in situ, it is an ectopic pregnancy in 15% to 50% of the cases. (II-2) 8. In women who conceive with an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) in place, early IUC removal improves outcomes but does not entirely eliminate risks. (II-2) 9. Intrauterine contraceptives do not increase the risk of infertility. (II-2) 10. Immediate insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive (10 minutes postplacental to 48 hours) postpartum or post-Caesarean section is associated with a higher continuation rate compared with insertion at 6 weeks postpartum. (I) 11. Immediate insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC; 10 minutes postplacental to 48 hours) postpartum or post-Caesarean section is associated with a higher risk of expulsion. (I) The benefit of inserting an IUC immediately postpartum or post-Caesarean section outweighs the disadvantages of increased risk of perforation and expulsion. (II-C) 12. Insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive in breastfeeding women is associated with a higher risk of uterine perforation in the first postpartum year. (II-2) 13. Immediate insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) post-abortion significantly reduces the risk of repeat abortion (II-2) and increases IUC continuation rates at 6 months. (I) 14. Antibiotic prophylaxis for intrauterine contraceptive insertion does not significantly reduce postinsertion pelvic infection. (I) RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Health care professionals should be careful not to restrict access to intrauterine contraceptives (IUC) owing to theoretical or unproven risks. (III-A) Health care professionals should offer IUCs as a first-line method of contraception to both nulliparous and multiparous women. (II-2A) 2. In women seeking intrauterine contraception (IUC) and presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding and/or dysmenorrhea, health care professionals should consider the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system 52 mg over other IUCs. (I-A) 3. Patients with breast cancer taking tamoxifen may consider a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system 52 mg after consultation with their oncologist. (I-A) 4. Women requesting a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or a copper-intrauterine device should be counseled regarding changes in bleeding patterns, sexually transmitted infection risk, and duration of use. (III-A) 5. A health care professional should be reasonably certain that the woman is not pregnant prior to inserting an intrauterine contraceptive at any time during the menstrual cycle. (III-A) 6. Health care providers should consider inserting an intrauterine contraceptive immediately after an induced abortion rather than waiting for an interval insertion. (I-B) 7. In women who conceive with an intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) in place, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy should be excluded as arly as possible. (II-2A) Once an ectopic pregnancy has been excluded, the IUC should be removed without an invasive procedure. The IUC may be removed at the time of a surgical termination. (II-2B) 8. In the case of pelvic inflammatory disease, it is not necessary to remove the intrauterine contraceptive unless there is no clinical improvement after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment. (II-2B) 9. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) insertion is not indicated. (I-B) Health care providers should perform sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing in women at high risk of STI at the time of IUC insertion. If the test is positive for chlamydia and/or gonorrhea, the woman should be appropriately treated postinsertion and the IUC can remain in situ. (II-2B) 10. Unscheduled bleeding in intrauterine contraception users, when persistent or associated with pelvic pain, should be investigated to rule out infection, pregnancy, gynecological pathology, expulsion or malposition.

Retrospective study of patients admitted to a tertiary emergency hospital between January 2013 - January 2015. There were 56 patients, 27 in the laparoscopic group (LG) and 28 in the open group (OG). The gynecological emergency was a ruptured ovarian cyst in 20 (74%) versus 17 (59%) cases, and an ectopic pregnancy with tubal rupture in 7 (26%) versus 12 (41%) patients in both the laparoscopic and open approaches, respectively. The main outcome - mean intraoperative hemoglobin decrease - was 1.5 +- 1.2 g/dl in the laparoscopic and 1.9 +-1.4 in the open approach (p=0.344). There were no differences regarding red blood transfusion rate, needs for analgesics, postoperative complications and in-hospital stay. The laparoscopic approach in acute abdomen of gynecologic origin is non-inferior to open surgery."

    "abstract": "Among the different causes of gynecological acute pelvic pain, ovarian torsion represents a surgical emergency. It is a rare case in the pediatric/adolescent aged group that must be included in the differential diagnosis of any girl with abdominal pain or pelvic/abdominal mass. Current recommendations suggest that laparoscopic detorsion should be performed in order to preserve the integrity of the ovaries and fertility, although oophoropexy may be considered in case of severe necrosis. Nevertheless, maintaining the circulation of the ovary after detorsion deteriorates the tissue injury and leads to a pathologic process called ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which is characterized by oxidative stress. During the detorsion process, an excess amount of molecular oxygen is supplied to the tissues, and reactive species of oxygen (ROS) such as superoxide radical (O2 (-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH•), as well as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are produced in excess. ROS, RNS and their toxic products cause DNA damage and lipid peroxidation in the cellular and mitochondrial membranes, leading to cell death. In spite of attention on this topic, currently there is no shared and clear evidence about the use of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents to prevent I/R damage after laparoscopic ovarian detorsion. Considering this element, future research should aim to develop shared protocols for the clinical use (route of application, dosage and time of application) of antioxidants after laparoscopic management of this condition."

The study population was comprised of pregnant patients accrued in a non-consecutive prospective manner from June 2014 to September 2015, who had an obstetrical ultrasound performed in the radiology department of an inner-city tertiary care hospital at the request of the ED. The feasibility and approval of direct communication between radiologist and patient were evaluated by means of a questionnaire presented by an independent observer to the ED provider, patient, and radiologist. The exam enrolled 54 patients. Ultrasound (US) exam results were divided into (31) normal live intrauterine gestation (group 1), (7) abnormal failed intrauterine gestation or ectopic pregnancy (group 2), and (16) indeterminate pregnancies that could not be placed in the former categories and may require a follow-up exam (group 3). Forty-five (83 %) ED providers approved of the radiologist's direct communication with patients. Fifty (93 %) patients stated a better understanding of the radiologist's role in their care after than before the interaction. The radiologists found the interaction with patients to be positive in 52 (96 %) cases. Direct communication between radiologist and patient yielded a good acceptance by the radiologist, ED provider, and patient. More importantly, after the encounter, the vast majority of patients reported a better understanding of the radiologist's role in their care."

    "abstract": "There are five reported cases of fetal meconium peritonitis developing after episodes of maternal hepatitis. These cases demonstrate a potential association between severe maternal liver injury and subsequent fetal meconium peritonitis. A 26-year-old primigravid woman developed acute liver failure 4 days after unilateral oophorectomy for ovarian torsion at 24 weeks of gestation. Her liver function gradually normalized with conservative management. She was readmitted for acute abdominal pain with elevated blood pressure at 29 weeks of gestation. An emergency cesarean delivery was performed for severe preeclampsia. Her neonate was noted to have a distended abdomen. Laparotomy and bowel resection were performed for meconium peritonitis and bowel perforation. Fetal meconium peritonitis may develop after severe maternal liver disease. Thus, the latter may warrant heightened fetal surveillance."

    "abstract": "Gallbladder cancer ranks fifth among oncological diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract; nevertheless, it is the world's most common malignant tumor of the bile ducts. It is usually diagnosed after cholecystectomy and tends to have bad prognosis. Adenocarcinoma is the main histological finding, although other rare histologic types have been described among the actual literature. Poorly differentiated squamous-cell neuroendocrine gallbladder carcinoma is an extremely rare neoplasm. A poor prognosis is associated with this histological type. The aim of this paper is to show that performing a systematic exploration of the entire peritoneal cavity in all laparoscopic surgeries can lead to find completely unexpected changes related to an unidentified disease. Also, a detailed review of our unexpected finding is made: The neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of gallbladder. We hereby report the case of a 40-year-old patient with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy that underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery, presenting the incidental finding of a small-cell carcinoma of the gallbladder. Our surgical group advised that by introducing the laparoscope, the entire peritoneal cavity must be systematically reviewed, in search of differential diagnoses and unidentified pathologies. We must use the diagnostic and therapeutic qualities of laparoscopy. Bile duct endocrine tumors tend to remain silent until advanced stages, making the prognosis usually unfavorable, especially when they are unresectable. Endocrine neoplasias of the gallbladder, although uncommon, should be taken into account as possible diagnoses due to its therapeutic and prognostic implications."

    "abstract": "To assess the safety profile of the low-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) total content 13.5mg (average approximate release rate 8μg/24h over the first year; LNG-IUS 8; Jaydess®) in adolescents. In a Phase III study in 36 European centers, 304 healthy nulliparous or parous postmenarcheal adolescents (12-17years) received LNG-IUS 8 for 12months. The primary outcome was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary outcomes included: serious TEAEs, adverse events of special interest, overall user satisfaction, discontinuation rate at 12months, and Pearl Index. LNG-IUS 8 placement was successful in 303/304 participants (99.7%). Overall, 82.6% of participants reported TEAEs, and serious TEAEs and serious study drug-related TEAEs were reported by 7.6% and 1.0% of participants, respectively. No cases of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, or uterine perforation were reported. No pregnancies were reported during the 12-month study. At Month 12/study end, the overall user satisfaction rate was 83.9%. Overall, 51 participants (16.8%) prematurely discontinued the study before 12months; 13.8% of participants discontinued owing to TEAEs. No new or unexpected safety events were associated with the low-dose LNG-IUS 8. The safety profile of LNG-IUS 8 in adolescents was consistent with that previously reported in adults. The high overall user-satisfaction rate at study end and the low discontinuation rate over 12months demonstrate that LNG-IUS 8 is a highly acceptable contraceptive method among adolescents. This study is the first to assess the low-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine system LNG-IUS 8 (average approximate release rate 8μg/24h over the first year and total content 13.5mg) specifically in females<18years of age and confirms the safety and efficacy of LNG-IUS 8 in an adolescent population."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pregnancy (pregnancy in the peritoneal cavity) is a very rare and serious type of extrauterine gestation that accounts for approximately 1.4% of all ectopic pregnancies. It also represents one of the few times an ectopic pregnancy can be carried to term. Early strategic diagnosis and management decisions can make a critical difference with regards to severity of morbidity and mortality risk. After an extensive search of the English language medical literature, we are unaware of any case of abdominal pregnancy in which the placenta was receiving its vascular supply from the sacral plexus. A 26-year-old African-American woman, primigravida, at 16 weeks 4 days' gestation, presented to our Emergency Department with abdominal pain. She did not complain of any vaginal bleeding. A physical examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness and no blood in the vaginal vault. Laboratory findings corresponded to an increased level of beta human chorionic gonadotropin; magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an abdominal pregnancy. She underwent feticide, administration of methotrexate and a laparotomy was done which was immediately deferred due to perceived increased bleeding risk. She was found to have an intra-abdominal ectopic pregnancy with the placenta attached to her omentum, cul-de-sac and rectosigmoid, with unusual and extensive vascularity from the sacral plexus. A repeat laparotomy was performed 11 weeks later, aimed at removal of the gestational sac and placenta that were left in situ on the first laparotomy. This time, we achieved successful removal of the peritoneal gestation, lysis of adhesions, ligation of vascular supply and cautery of the diminished vasculature. Subsequently, she had two ectopic pregnancies, which were managed with both medical and surgical interventions. Ectopic pregnancies should be identified early and evaluated for the etiology of the presentation. Rarely, an ectopic pregnancy implants at an extratubal location. Today, early intervention saves lives and reduces morbidity, but ectopic pregnancy still accounts for 4 to 10% of pregnancy-related deaths and leads to a high incidence of ectopic site gestations in future pregnancies. Medical management has emerged as a safe alternative to surgery and holds promise for preservation of future fertility; however, surgery remains an acceptable modality. We found that careful and strategic choice of management pathway can make all the difference to a favorable outcome. As emergency physicians, we need to be aware of the possibility of abdominal ectopic pregnancy in such presentations and its severe consequences if it remains undiagnosed."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy outcomes after emergency contraceptive use has been debated over time, but review of the literature includes mechanisms by which these medications may increase the chance of an ectopic pregnancy. Such cases are infrequently reported, and many emergency providers may not readily consider this possibility when treating patients. This is a case presentation of ectopic pregnancy in a patient who had recently used Plan B (levonorgestrel) emergency contraceptive. She presented with abdominal pain and vaginal spotting, and was evaluated by serum testing and pelvic ultrasound. She was discovered to have a right adnexal pregnancy. She was treated initially with methotrexate, though she ultimately required surgery for definitive treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This case report aims to bring a unique clinical case to the attention of emergency providers. The goal is to review research on the topic of levonorgestrel use and the incidence of ectopic pregnancies. The mechanism of action of this emergency contraceptive is addressed, and though no definite causal relationship is known between levonorgestrel and ectopic pregnancies, there is a pharmacologic explanation for how this event may occur after use of this medication. Ultimately, the emergency provider will be reminded of the importance of educating the patient on the possible outcomes after its use, including failure of an emergency contraceptive and the potential of ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Cervical pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy with potential grave consequences occurring in approximately 1:9,000 deliveries. It is life-threatening as the pregnancy is implanted in the endocervical canal and the trophoblast can penetrate through the cervical wall and into the uterine blood supply resulting in catastrophic haemorrhage. Historically, the treatment had been hysterectomy because of the considerable risk of life-threatening haemorrhage, but in the recent past various conservative management modalities have been applied to preserve fertility. Here, we report a case of successful (both medical and surgical) management of cervical ectopic pregnancy in a young woman. A 29-year-old, gravid 2, para1 and living 1 with previous caesarean section had presented with mild bleeding per vagina for 5 days following 7 weeks of amenorrhoea. Past menstrual, medical, surgical and family history were unremarkable except the previous caesarean section. On examination vital signs were normal but pelvic examination revealed a distended cervix with bulky uterus, without anyadnexal mass or tenderness and no cervical motion tenderness. Further transvaginal sonography showed a live cervical gestation of 7 weeks and 4 days and serum beta-HCG value of 1,03,113mIU/ml. Patient received conservative approach with combination of intraamniotic potassium chloride and methotrexate and suction curettage. Due to conservative approach emergency hysterectomy and blood transfusion was avoided."

This study included 600 women who had visited the hospital with LNG-EC failure. Of these, 300 with EP and 300 with intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) were recruited to the EP group and IUP group respectively. The participants were interviewed face-to-face using a standardized questionnaire. Pearson's chi-square tests and t-test were used to compare the sociodemographic characteristics, reproductive and gynecological history, surgical history, previous contraceptive experience, and answers to 10 questions concerning the knowledge about LNG-EC. Those who gave incorrect answers to the question regarding the basic mechanism and specific method of levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (LNG-ECPs) were at a higher risk of EP after LNG-EC failure. Women who did not strictly follow instructions or advice from healthcare professionals were more likely to subsequently experience EP (p < 10(-4) ). Women with LNG-EC failure reported friends/peers, TV, and Internet as the main sources of information. No difference was observed with regard to the sources of knowledge on LNG-EC (p = 0.07). The results illustrate the importance of strictly following the doctor's guidance or drug instructions when using LNG-ECPs. The media should be used to disseminate information about responsible EC, and pharmacy staff should receive regular educational training sessions in this regard. © 2016 The Authors.

    "abstract": "The coexistence of extrauterine and intrauterine or haeterotopic pregnancy (HP) is a rare condition with reported incidence of 1 in 8000 to 1 in 30 000 pregnancies in natural conceived pregnancies, but with the widespread application of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) the incidence of HP in women with ART has risen to about 0.09% to 1.00%. We have reported a case of a 36 old woman, pregnant in 9 gestation week, gravidity 2, 0 para, who have achieved a pregnancy after in-vitro fertilization - embryo-transfer of two freeze embryos, developed after an ICSI procedure with donor eggs. The patient attended our clinic because of acute abdominal pain. She was evaluated by trans-vaginal sonography and coexistence of ectopic tubal and intrauterine pregnancy has been confirmed. Emergency laparoscopy was carried out. Left tubal ectopic pregnancy and hemoperitoneum (1200 ml) were diagnosed. Left salpingectomy was performed. At present, the patient is at 24 gestation week and the pregnancy is developing in a proper manner. We report such a case due to the increase of the awareness to the condition and the possibility of a successful treatment by a laparoscopic surgery. Intrauterine pregnancy does not exclude extrauterine pregnancy especially in cases after in-vitro fertilization."

    "title": "Frequency and related factors of tubal patency after methotrexate treatment in women with ectopic pregnancy.",
    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency. The classic treatment for this condition is surgery but early diagnosis allows for non-surgical treatment. In recent years, intramuscular methotrexate has been considered, due to easy administration, its less invasive nature and low complications, but there are arguments about its effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate tubal patency after treatment of ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate and related factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 80 women with ectopic pregnancy who were admitted to Sanandaj Be'sat Hospital in 2014. Patients who had successful treatment for ectopic pregnancy with single or multiple doses of methotrexate 50 mL/m(2) were enrolled. Three to 6 months after treatment, the patients were evaluated for tubal patency by hysterosalpingography. Data were analyzed using spss, t-tests, χ(2) -test and logistic regression. The tubal patency rate after treatment of ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate was 75% in hysterosalpingography. The average size of the ectopic pregnancy mass of women with open fallopian tubes was 22.5 ± 7.0 mm and for women with closed fallopian tubes it was 34.7 ± 10.0 mm (P = 0.0001). β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels were 642.1 ± 850.5 in women with open fallopian tubes and 3816.3 ± 4487.3 for women with closed fallopian tubes (P = 0.0001). There was no significant correlation statistically between tubal patency with a history of stillbirth and number of pregnancies (P > 0.5). There was a statistically significant relation between tubal patency and the number of births and also methotrexate dose (P < 0.05). Treatment of ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate is effective for saving tubal patency. Levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin-β < 1745, the treatment regimen of methotrexate (single or multiple doses) and ectopic pregnancy mass size smaller than 33.5 mm are significant predictors of tubal patency."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is defined as the simultaneous occurrence of intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy, either of which may be single or multiple. It occurs in up to 1% of pregnancies after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. This article reports 2 rare cases of heterotopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilization and presents a literature review. In the first case, a 28-year-old woman had previous laparoscopic bilateral total salpingectomy for a right tubal pregnancy and a left hydrosalpinx. However, she had ovarian heterotopic pregnancy after a third in vitro fertilization cycle. Emergency laparotomy was performed. The synchronous intrauterine pregnancy continued with no further complications and ended in the delivery of a singleton term pregnancy. The second case combined interstitial and intrauterine pregnancies after bilateral tubal ligation for hydrosalpinges followed by in vitro fertilization and frozen embryo transfer. The possibility of heterotopic pregnancy after bilateral total salpingectomy/tubal ligation, although extremely rare, should also be considered by gynecologists when they treat an in vitro fertilization patient even though an intrauterine pregnancy has been confirmed."

    "abstract": "Pregnancy in a rudimentary uterine horn is a rare event with an estimated incidence of 1 in 76,000 to 1 in 1,40,000 pregnancies. Unicornuate uterus with a rudimentary horn has a high incidence of obstetric and gynecological complications. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the rudimentary horn is one of the most dreaded complications, which can have grave consequences for both mother and fetus. In the majority of the cases, it is detected after rupture of the horn, usually during the first or second trimester of pregnancy. An ultrasonographic diagnosis made prior to rupture of the rudimentary horn may prevent this catastrophic outcome. We report a case of a G2 P1 L1 with a ruptured left rudimentary horn pregnancy at 16 weeks of gestation that was misdiagnosed as a pregnancy in the left uterine horn of a bicornuate uterus on prior prenatal ultrasound. The patient presented to our hospital with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. A diagnosis of ruptured left rudimentary horn pregnancy was made on the basis of emergency ultrasound and was later confirmed on laparotomy. The left rudimentary horn along with the ipsilateral fallopian tube was excised."

    "abstract": "Since being introduced more than 30 years ago, endovaginal ultrasonography (US) and quantitative testing of serum levels of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin have become the standard means of establishing the presence of normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), failed IUP, and ectopic pregnancy. Appropriate use of these powerful tools requires clear, standardized interpretations based on conservative criteria to protect both the pregnancy and the mother. Since diagnoses are assigned earlier and available medical treatments for ectopic pregnancy and failed IUP are expanding, emphasis must carefully shift toward watchful waiting when the mother is clinically stable and a definitive location for the pregnancy cannot be established with US. To this end and to prevent inadvertent harm to early normal pregnancies, the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a consensus panel of radiologists, obstetricians, and emergency medicine physicians in 2012 with the goal of reviewing current literature and clinical practices and formulating modern criteria and terminology for the various first-trimester outcomes."

The authors discuss the details of representative cases of a parovarial cyst, an intestinal duplication, and an omental cyst with emphasis on the clinical symptoms, diagnostic tools, and surgical interventions. The authors conclude that abdominal cysts often cause mild symptoms only, and they are discovered accidentally by ultrasound imaging performed for other reasons. In some cases, the cyst can cause severe complaints or even acute abdomen requiring emergency surgery. Laporoscopy may be a valuable method both in diagnosis and surgical therapy. Abdominal CT or MRI are not required in the majority of the patients."

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide recommendations for use of emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), including levonorgestrel (LNG) and combined oral contraceptives (COCs). A new ECP formulation, ulipristal acetate (UPA), is now available worldwide. To determine whether LNG, UPA or COC (Yuzpe) ECPs are safe for women with certain characteristics or medical conditions, we searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases for articles published from date of inception until May 2015 pertaining to the safety of LNG, UPA or Yuzpe ECP use. For direct evidence, we considered studies that looked at safety outcomes among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics taking ECPs compared with women not taking ECPs. For indirect evidence, we considered studies that reported pharmacokinetic (PK) data for ECP use among women with certain medical conditions or characteristics and studies that reported safety outcomes among healthy women taking ECPs. Five studies provided direct evidence; of these five studies, four examined LNG or Yuzpe use among pregnant or breastfeeding women, and one reported risk of ectopic pregnancy among women repeatedly using LNG ECPs. Poor pregnancy outcomes were rare among pregnant women who used LNG or Yuzpe ECPs during the conception cycle or early pregnancy. Breastfeeding outcomes did not differ between women exposed to LNG ECP and those unexposed, and there was no increased risk of ectopic pregnancy versus intrauterine pregnancy after repeated use of LNG ECPs compared with nonuse. Forty-five studies provided indirect evidence. One PK study demonstrated that LNG passes into breastmilk but in minimal quantities. In addition, nine studies examined pregnancy outcomes following ECP failure among healthy women, and 35 articles reported adverse events. Studies suggest that serious adverse events are rare among women taking any of these ECP formulations. Evidence on safety of ECPs among women with characteristics or medical conditions listed within WHO and CDC family planning guidance is limited. However, both direct and indirect evidence for our study question did not suggest any special safety concerns for the use of ECPs among women with particular medical conditions or personal characteristics, such as pregnancy, lactation or frequent ECP use."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy which occurs due to ruptured uterine or tubal pregnancy into the abdomen. Fetal loss is a common complication of these pregnancies and patient presents with acute abdominal pain which is a surgical emergency. Another rare but established complication of this ectopic pregnancy is fetal demise with the dead fetus being retained in the abdomen. It gets macerated and mummified over a period of time and is mostly detected incidentally during imaging. Radiological imaging has hallmark appearances of such a macerated fetus showing multiple fetal parts embedded in a calcified sac termed as lithopedion or stone baby. We report a unique case of retained abdominal pregnancy for 36 years in a 60-year-old postmenopausal female presented with abdominal pain and difficulty in micturition.

In a prospective diagnostic performance study from January 2009 to December 2013, patients under 60 presenting with acute abdominal pain, that required imaging following surgical review, were imaged with T2 HASTE MR. Rapid acquisition HASTE (Half Fourier Acquisition Single Shot Turbo Spin Echo) coronal and axial sequences were obtained, without intravenous contrast. Patients were followed up clinically for a minimum of 3 months. 468 cases included in the study. 349 were negative for acute abdominal pathology, 116 positive for acute abdominal pathology and 3 were indeterminate. In the MR positive group (n=116), 64 had surgery confirming findings (34 appendicitis, 14 SBO, 3 ovarian torsion, 3 LBO, intussusception, ovarian carcinoma, ovarian dermoid, 2 pelvic inflammatory disease, diverticular abscess, crohns, 4 endoscopy for acute bowel pathology) while 51 were managed conservatively with concordant follow up (4 SBO, 11 diverticulitis, 6 pelvic inflammatory disease, 7 inflammatory bowel disease, 7 colitis, 6 pyelonephritis, 2 cholecystitis, renal abscess, pseudomembranous colitis, splenic haematoma, mesenteric adenitis, 2 pancreatitis, lymphoma, epiploic appendagitis). 1 patient had an MR diagnosis of appendicitis but at laparoscopy a sigmoid diverticular perforation was diagnosed and the appendix was normal. In the MR negative group (n=349), 324 had uneventful follow-up, 22 had negative laparoscopies, while 3 had subsequent appendectomies, with appendicitis on histology (3 days, 10 days and 2 months post scan). In the MR indeterminate group (n=3), one was treated conservatively with uneventful follow up, one had laparoscopic appendectomy with normal appendix on histology, one had laparoscopic appendectomy with acute appendicitis on histology. When MR correlated with clinical follow up (n=468), overall diagnostic accuracy is 99% (463/468). When MR findings correlated with direct visualisation at surgery/endoscopy (n=90), sensitivity is 98% (95% CI) and specificity is 92% (95% CI). This study demonstrates that rapid acquisition axial and coronal T2 HASTE MR is a practical, safe and effective method in the diagnosis of acute abdominal pain. MR is the preferred option to CT in patients of an age prone to radiation with a potential surgical diagnosis. MRI in acute abdominal imaging is both effective and practical and is the preferred imaging option in patients of an age prone to radiation with a potential surgical diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy that implants within the scar tissue of a previous caesarean scar is a situation that is seldom encountered and is almost invariably incompatible with a successful pregnancy. Caesarean scar ectopic pregnancies are fraught with life threatening complications such as scar rupture, significant haemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation and the need for emergency life saving hysterectomy. The clinical diagnosis can be elusive, particularly in the early stages; therefore clinicians should be familiar with the condition's sonographic hallmarks. Early diagnosis and management is the key to preventing these complications. We describe a case of caesarean scar pregnancy which was initially misdiagnosed as \"a spontaneous miscarriage in progress\", resulting in uncontrollable bleeding, necessitating an emergency abdominal hysterectomy. We also endeavour to review the literature with regards to the use of ultrasound in its management, treatment and follow up."

Thirty-seven patients (41 ovaries) were surgically treated for ovarian tumors. Four cases were bilateral. The data on the patient symptoms at presentation, imaging, treatment, outcome, pathology, and status of ovarian preservation were retrospectively analyzed for each patient. Histological examinations revealed 25 mature teratomas, 5 immature teratomas, 5 cystadenomas, 2 dysgerminomas, and other tumors. Ovarian torsion occurred in 16 ovaries (39%). Ovary-sparing surgery was performed in 22 ovaries (53.7%). Successful ovarian preservation was significantly associated with a smaller tumor size, benign pathology, and a lower degree of torsion (P<0.01). Because the prognosis was favorable in most cases, the preservation of fertility and gonadal function should be a goal in the surgical treatment of ovarian tumors. We recommend ovary-sparing surgery as the first-line treatment for all pediatric ovarian tumors other than those that are preoperatively diagnosed as being malignant and those in which emergent surgical intervention is indicated owing to the suspicion of ovarian torsion."

However, with in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments, ovarian hyperstimulation may increase the size of the ovaries and result in the occurrence of adnexal torsion. Here, we report two cases of ovarian torsion after IVF and discuss the optimal management of this emergency medical condition. The first case was a 23-year-old woman who received IVF-embryo transfer due to tubal factor infertility. Sudden-onset, lower abdominal pain developed at the 6th week of pregnancy. Conservative treatment with antibiotics was the initial approach, but a right oophorectomy had to be performed due to right ovarian torsion with hemorrhagic and gangrenous changes. The second case was a 38-year-old woman diagnosed with bilateral ovarian torsion at 8 weeks' gestation due to the sudden onset of low abdominal pain. Laparoscopy was arranged immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed. The left ovary was successfully preserved due to prompt intervention. Both pregnancies continued without problems after surgery. Ovarian hyperstimulation during IVF-embryo transfer treatment is a risk factor for developing adnexal torsion. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention is the only way to protect the ovary and preserve the pregnancy. Laparoscopic surgery in early pregnancy causes no harm to the fetus and should be encouraged once the diagnosis is confirmed. Delaying surgery may induce serious infection and jeopardize the lives of both the fetus and mother."

Data were recorded with individual diagnoses by means of yes/no binary as the visualization of variables: gestational sac, embryo, embryo heartbeat, topical or ectopic pregnancy. Concordance was calculated using the kappa coefficient with its respective 95% confidential intervals (CI). There was no disagreement between the methods when compared the pocket and conventional ultrasounds. The best comparative result between the devices was as the visualization of the embryo heartbeat with kappa coefficient of 0.84 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.89). However, the pocket ultrasound had a low correlation for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, with kappa coefficient of -0.02 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.19).

Stratified analysis showed that in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) was the main risk factor for EP in women with tubal infertility (AOR = 8.99, 95% CI: 1.98-40.84), although IVF-ET showed no association with EP in women with non-tubal infertility (AOR = 2.52, 95% CI: 0.14-44.67). In addition to the traditional risk factors, IVF-ET and current IUD use play dominant roles in the occurrence of EP. Attention should be given to women with tubal infertility who have undergone IVE-ET treatment."

The diagnosis is based on a quantitative serum pregnancy test (hCG) and transvaginal ultrasound. An acute situation requires emergency surgery, whereas patients with mild symptoms should be treated policlinically by follow-up or a single intramuscular dose (1 mg/kg) of methotrexate. No folic acid supplementation is needed. In later pregnancies their location should be verified by transvaginal ultrasound done by the seventh gestational week at the latest."

    "title": "Clinical risk factors for ovarian torsion.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a relatively common gynaecological emergency, usually presenting as acute lower abdominal pain. The underlying pathophysiology involves torsion of the ovarian tissue on its pedicle leading to reduced venous return, stromal oedema, internal haemorrhage and infarction with the subsequent sequelae. It is not clear from looking at the literature which factors are responsible for the development of ovarian torsion and what are the odds of a particular clinical feature in determining the likelihood of developing ovarian torsion. In order to assess the likelihood of a particular clinical feature to be a risk factor for ovarian torsion, we studied the prevalence of each presenting clinical feature in the background population of women, for instance, looking at ovarian cysts and compared this with the odds of the feature occurring in the affected population of torsion patients. Thus we compared the odds of various clinical variables in ovarian torsion patients against the odds of the same feature occurring in the background population of women. Ovarian cysts are three times more common in ovarian torsion cohorts than in the general population. Evidence suggests that ovarian cysts are very common in the asymptomatic pregnant cohorts; however, they spontaneously resolve as the pregnancy progresses. Pregnancy is a risk factor for torsion (odds ratio: 18:1); however, it remains an uncommon event (0.167%). Tubal sterilisation practices vary according to geographical location and over chronology of the published literature. After considering the extremes of variation in tubal sterilisation practices, the risk of torsion increases by at least 8-fold following surgery. Hysterectomy with ovarian conservation is not a risk factor of torsion."

At the time of the first methotrexate dose, the serum hCG concentration was 27,995 IU/L. The laboratory was consulted 3.5 months after the surgery, because serum hCG levels had stopped declining and had leveled off to around 80 to 90 IU/L but with negative urine pregnancy tests. Laboratory studies ruled out heterophile antibody interference and hook effect by multiple methods including analysis by different serum hCG assays, treatment with heterophile antibody blocking agents, and dilution studies. Three additional doses of methotrexate over six months were required for serum hCG concentrations to decline to undetectable levels. This case illustrates challenges that may arise with serum hCG measurements in management of ectopic pregnancies. Close collaboration between the laboratory and clinical service is key for optimal patient care."

Symptoms similar to those of an ectopic pregnancy develop when an extra-uterine lesion is present in the abdominal cavity, and lesions have been detected in the ovaries and fallopian tubes in a number of cases. In the present study, we describe a patient with choriocarcinoma that metastasized to the uterine serosa and caused symptoms similar to those of an ectopic pregnancy. The patient was a 30-year-old female who presented to our hospital with atypical genital bleeding and a positive pregnancy test 3 months after missed abortion at 10 weeks of gestation. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed the absence of a gestational sac in or outside the uterus, and intra-abdominal bleeding was noted. An ectopic pregnancy was suspected based on these findings, and emergency laparotomy was performed. A hemorrhagic mass was present on the uterine serosa, and was subsequently resected. Trophoblastic disease was suspected following histopathological examination, for which intra-uterine curettage was performed and choriocarcinoma was diagnosed. Lung metastasis was detected on computed tomography, and a high serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level persisted following surgery. The lesion disappeared following five cycles of methotrexate+ etoposide+actinomycin D therapy, which was performed as postoperative chemotherapy, and the patient's serum hCG level decreased to below the detection limit. In this case of choriocarcinoma, the primary lesion was present in the uterus and had metastasized to the uterine serosa, which is a very rare metastatic site. This uterine serosal metastatic lesion bled and caused symptoms similar to those of an ectopic pregnancy. Certain patients who undergo surgery for a suspected peritoneal pregnancy may have gestational choriocarcinoma, similar to this case."

The normal sonographic and magnetic resonance findings of this phenomenon will be discussed, including the appearance of complications associated with abnormal placentation, such as the placenta accreta spectrum. Cases of CSEP at our institution will be illustrated, along with clinical presentations and treatment outcomes. The study included women who were diagnosed with a CSEP in the first trimester, which was confirmed by ultrasound. The clinical presentations, imaging findings, and treatment outcomes of these pregnancies were recorded. In our series, treatment ranged from no intervention with fetal demise on short-term follow-up ultrasound to viable near-term deliveries requiring cesarean section, urgent blood products, and emergent surgery. The majority of our cases 75% (15 of 20) underwent successful early first trimester termination by a combination of systemic methotrexate administration, ultrasound-guided injection of embryocidal agents, and/or surgery. Early imaging recognition and diagnosis of CSEP is critically important to minimize maternal complications, maintain treatment options, and potentially preserve future fertility."

After excluding pregnancy in reproductive-age women, ultrasonography plays a major role in the prompt and accurate diagnosis of adnexal causes of acute pelvic pain, such as hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, endometriosis, ovarian torsion, and tubo-ovarian abscess. Its availability, relatively low cost, and lack of ionizing radiation make ultrasonography an ideal imaging modality in women of reproductive age.

    "abstract": "Ovarian pregnancy is a rare form of ectopic pregnancy but it is the most common type of nontubal ectopic pregnancy. Many times it is operated with a misdiagnosis of ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic corpus luteum. The high resolution transvaginal ultrasonography is a valuable tool for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy but ovarian pregnancy still remains a diagnostic problem and a continuous challenge to the gynecologist. The correct diagnosis is made at the time of surgery and confirmation is by histopathological report. Here we report three cases of primary ovarian ectopic pregnancies, consistent with the Spiegelberg's criteria. Out of this, two cases have corroboration of ovarian ectopic pregnancy with use of intrauterine contraceptive device and one case by chance without any preexisting risk factors, probably due to interference in the release of ovum from the follicle. In all the three cases, emergency laparotomy was done for ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy and the diagnosis of ruptured primary ovarian pregnancy was made at the time of surgery, this was subsequently confirmed by histopathology report. In the era where wider usage of intrauterine devices, ovulatory drugs and assisted reproductive techniques are rife, there is a possibility of an increase in the incidence of this rare entity, so ovarian ectopic pregnancy should be kept in mind as a possibility. Thereby early diagnosis by high resolution transvaginal ultrasound and laparoscopy can decrease the risk of complications like rupture, secondary implantation, hemorrhagic shock and maternal mortality."

A retrospective evaluation of diagnosed and treated 26 patients with CSPs in Istanbul Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training and Research Hospital during a 6-year period was discussed. Suction curettage was performed as first-line treatment in patients with a gestation <8 weeks and myometrial thickness >2 mm. Twenty-two (84.6%) patients with CSPs were initially treated surgically (curettage and hysterotomy) and four (15.4%) patients were treated medically with methotrexate injections. Vacuum aspiration was performed in 19 patients as a first-line treatment, six of them needed an additional Foley balloon catheter to be inserted for tamponade because of persistent vaginal bleeding. Suction curettage was successful in 12 patients. The treatment rate for suction curettage with or without Foley balloon catheter tamponade was 16 of 19 (84.2%).

The pregnancy had been obtained by oocyte donation and in vitro fertilization (IVF) because of Turner's syndrome. The abdominal ultrasound scan showed a normal pregnancy and a conserved foetal cardiac activity. It also showed a large amount of free fluid in the perihepatic space. Haemoglobin was 11.2 g/dL. After hemodynamic degradation, urgent laparoscopy showed an unrepairable uterine rupture with partial exteriorisation of the pregnancy, and placenta percreta. Urgent conversion to laparotomy allowed haemostatic hysterectomy. Uterine rupture during pregnancy obtained by oocyte donation in Turner's syndrome may be life threatening. The possibility of such a complication should be considered before oocyte donation for IVF in Turner's patients.

    "abstract": "Hyperreactio luteinalis (HL) is characterized by multicystic bilateral enlargement of the ovaries and is a self-limiting benign condition associated with pregnancy or trophoblastic disease. Since HL regresses spontaneously over time, it should be managed conservatively as long as the patient's condition permits; torsion of the enlarged ovaries is believed to be the only exception that mandates surgical intervention. Here, we describe a case of HL complicated by ovarian torsion that was treated successfully without surgical intervention. A 33-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital owing to acute abdomen. Nine days previously, she had had a stillbirth caused by hydrops fetalis at 24 weeks' gestation. The characteristic findings observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) led to the diagnosis of HL complicated by torsion of the enlarged left ovary. Emergency laparoscopic detorsion of the ischemic left ovary was planned. Aiming to reduce the risk of cystic injury and bleeding at the trocar insertion site, volume reduction of the left ovarian cyst was performed by percutaneous aspiration. The patient's pain diminished rapidly and laparoscopic surgery was deferred. Subsequent MRI revealed that gadolinium enhancement of the left ovarian tumor had been restored, indicating spontaneous detorsion of the left ovary. The patient remained asymptomatic and was discharged from the hospital 12 days after aspiration of the cyst. From this experience, we propose that, in cases of ovarian torsion occurring in large functional cysts, including HL, volume reduction by percutaneous cyst aspiration should be considered before performing emergency laparoscopic surgery."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is an uncommon gynecological emergency that most often affects women of reproductive age. Its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other abdominal conditions, which make its differential diagnosis challenging. Color Doppler (Doppler USG) and B-flow ultrasonography (B-flow USG) are used for the differential diagnosis of ovarian torsion, and in this study, we aimed to evaluate these two techniques, validate B-flow USG as the gold standard non invasive diagnostic tool in the early phase of an ovarian torsion, and show that the B-flow USG is superior to the color Doppler USG. Sixteen rabbits of the same age and weight were separated into 2 subgroups of 8. In Group I (sham group), right ovaries were fixated, and in Group II (torsion group), right ovaries underwent 720° torsion in a counterclockwise direction. At 1h and 2h of ischemia, both ovaries were measured by the two techniques, and an additional measurement was taken at 24h to determine any changes in the left ovary due to the right ovary ischemia. Volume flow, peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) measurements were taken both with color Doppler USG (using a 12MHz linear probe, General Electric Medical Systems Logic 7, Milwaukee, USA) and with B-flow USG. The right Doppler RI and PI values at 1h were significantly higher than the right B-flow values (p<0.05). The difference between the left B-flow RI and PI values and the left Doppler values at 1h was not significant (p>0.05), nor was the difference between the right B-flow RI value at 2h and the right Doppler RI value at 2h (p>0.05). The right B-flow PI value at 2h was statistically different from the right Doppler PI value at 2h (p<0.05), although the differences between the left B-flow RI and PI values at 1h and 2h and the left Doppler RI and PI values were not (p>0.05). However, there was a significant difference between the RI values at 24h (p<0.05). In this study, the decrease in blood reperfusion at 1h measured by B-flow USG was apparently higher than that measured by Doppler USG. However, by the end of 2h, the measurements were equal (see Fig. 3 and 4). In conclusion, B-flow USG reveals the decrease in the blood flow more distinctly in the early phase. Moreover, B-flow Doppler USG is more reliable and advantageous than color Doppler USG because it provides a more accurate preoperative evaluation of the unilateral and contralateral preoperative adnexial structures, and allows for a better assessment of blood flow in the ovarian torsion."

    "abstract": "To identify non-invasive tools for diagnosis of the major potentially life-threatening gynaecological emergencies (G-PLEs) reported in previous studies, and to assess their diagnostic accuracy. MEDLINE; EMBASE; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library) were searched to identify all eligible studies published in English or French between January 1990 and December 2012. Studies were considered eligible if they were primary diagnostic studies of any designs, with a gold standard and with sufficient information for construction of a 2 × 2 contingency table, concerning at least one of the following G-PLEs: complicated ectopic pregnancy, complicated pelvic inflammatory disease, adnexal torsion and haemoperitoneum of any gynaecological origin. Extraction of data and assessment of study quality were conducted by two independent reviewers. We set the thresholds for the diagnostic value of signs retrieved at Sensibility ≥ 95% and LR-≤ 0.25, or Specificity ≥ 90% and LR+ ≥ 4. We identified 8288 reports of diagnostic studies for the selected G-PLEs, 45 of which met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included studies was generally low. The most common diagnostic tools evaluated were transvaginal ultrasound (20/45), followed by medical history (18/45), clinical examination (15/45) and laboratory tests (14/45). Standardised questioning about symptoms, systolic blood pressure<110 mmHg, shock index>0.85, identification of a mass by abdominal palpation or vaginal examination, haemoglobin concentration <10 g/dl and six ultrasound and Doppler signs presented high performances for the diagnosis of G-PLEs. Transvaginal ultrasound was the diagnostic tool with the best individual performance for the diagnosis of all G-PLEs. This systematic review suggests that blood pressure measurement, haemoglobin tests and transvaginal ultrasound are cornerstone examinations for the diagnosis of G-PLEs that should be available in all gynaecological emergency care services. Standardised questioning about symptoms could be used for triage of patients."

    "abstract": "Despite the major advances made in the diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancies in the last two decades, an accurate diagnosis can sometimes still be quite challenging, since it relies on the combination of ultrasound findings and serial serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) measurements. This paper describes the case of a 36-year-old woman of Caucasian origin who was admitted to the emergency department of our clinic with clinical symptoms of hemorrhagic shock in combination with two negative pregnancy tests done by her at home and a negative urine test which was performed on her admission to the hospital. Quantitative measurement of β-hCG in the serum of the patient was 13 mIU/mL. On admission, right tubal pregnancy was diagnosed on ultrasound and she underwent an emergency laparotomy due to signs of hemodynamic shock. It is sometimes a considerable challenge to identify a patient with an ectopic pregnancy at risk of rupture. This case of ectopic pregnancy which was followed by a negative pregnancy test illustrates the magnitude of the difficulties involved in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. It also demonstrates the need to maintain a high clinical index of suspicion and to undertake careful clinical examination of the patient on the basis of the clinician's diagnostic research.

    "abstract": "Cases of ectopic pregnancy (EP) following levonorgestrel emergency contraception (LNG-EC) failure have been reported continuously, but whether there is an association between EP risk and LNG-EC is unclear. We concluded a case-control study to explore this association by recruiting 2,411 EP patients as case group, and 2,416 women with intrauterine pregnancy and 2,419 non-pregnant women as control groups. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidential intervals (CIs) were calculated and adjusted for potential confounding factors. Previous use of LNG-EC was not correlated with the EP. Compared to women who did not use contraceptives, current use of LNG-EC reduced the risk for intrauterine pregnancy (Adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.14-0.27), but did not increase the risk for EP (AOR2 = 1.04, 95%CI: 0.76-1.42). Furthermore, compared to women who did not have further act of intercourse, women with unprotected further act of intercourse were at a higher risk of EP (AOR1 = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.17-4.71), and women with repeated use of LNG-EC for further intercourse during the same cycle was also associated with a higher risk for EP (AOR1 = 3.08, 95%CI: 1.09-8.71; AOR2 = 2.49, 95%CI: 1.00-6.19). A better understanding of the risk of EP following LNG-EC failure can optimize LNG-EC use and thus reduce the risk of EP."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies account for 10-15% of all maternal deaths. Rupture of an ectopic pregnancy is an urgent medical situation, therefore prediction of any tubal rupture before its occurrence is extremely important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tubal rupture rate in different treatment modalities in EP cases and to find a hCG level on admission and/or size of ectopic mass predictive for tubal rupture. Demographic data and medical data were extracted from patient charts for 211 cases who had diagnosis of tubal ectopic pregnancy. Women with tubal rupture were compared to those without rupture. Expectant management, single dose methotrexate and primary surgical treatment were applied to 83 cases (39%), 93 cases (44%) and 35 cases (17%), respectively. The tubal rupture occurred in 14.7% of the study population. If the EP mass diameter is <2 cm, no tubal rupture was found. hCG values at admission were found to be predictive for rupture. On admission, hCG level of 1855 IU/L had 93.5%, sensitivity and 29% positive predictive value for tubal rupture. In tubal ectopic pregnancy cases, hCG level on admission and size of ectopic pregnancy mass can predict tubal rupture."

No contraceptive measure was adopted for 259 women (32.4%). The risk factors related to EP included oral emergency contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility history, previous EP, smoking and age, etc. Based upon multivariate Logistic regression analysis of screening results, the decreasing odds rations were infertility, EP history, smoking history, emergency contraceptive use, history of EP, IUD, pelvic inflammatory disease and age. The risks of EP are affected by many factors, including infertility, EP history, smoking history, emergency contraceptive use, history of EP, IUD, pelvic inflammatory disease and age."

We conducted a secondary analysis of a previously reported prospective study of pelvic sonography for symptomatic first-trimester pregnancy. The 21st through 40th examinations were compared between those who completed an emergency ultrasound elective and those who did not. The reference standard was pelvic sonography done by the department of radiology. Eighty-six examinations (34%) were done by 12 operators who did not participate in an emergency ultrasound elective, and 171 examinations (67%) were done by 13 operators who completed an emergency ultrasound elective. There was no statistical difference between the groups with regard to identifying an intrauterine pregnancy, molar pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or adnexal mass. The accuracy of pelvic sonography for first-trimester pregnancy was comparable between physicians who participated in a 2-week emergency ultrasound elective and those who performed the same number of examinations over a longer period during residency training."

This prospective descriptive study was conducted in Gynaecology and Obstetrical Unit-II of Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Hospital Hyderabad from 1st May 2009 to 30th April 2012. All women diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy were included in the study. A predesigned pro forma was used to record the details about demographic features, pre-existing risk factors, clinical features at presentation and management of ectopic pregnancy. Data was analysed using SPSS-11. Total numbers of admission during study period were 9600 with 60 cases of ectopic pregnancy, thus representing the frequency of 0.6% (1 in 160). Majority of women 43 (72%) were of 20-30 year age, multigravida 31 (52%) were the most sufferers. Pelvic inflammatory disease 27 (45%), previous abortion 20 (33%), previous surgery 12 (20%) were seen as common risk factors; however no risk factor was identified in 21 (35%) women. Typical history of amenorrhea and abdominal pain was found in 46 (77%) women, 23 (38%) were in a state of shock. Laparotomy was performed in 53 (88%) women. Three (5%) women were treated successfully with methotrexate. Laparoscopic surgery was done in 2 patients and 2 patients were required both Laparoscopy proceeded by laparotomy. No maternal death related to ectopic pregnancy was reported in our study. The early diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy is one of the greatest challenges for obstetricians.

In this prospective case-control study, 34 women (the study group) with acute pelvic pain (20 with and 14 without ovarian torsion) and 40 control subjects were included. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was confirmed with laparoscopy in all cases. Preoperative serum samples were collected in the study group. Serum oxidative stress marker levels (IMA and MDA) and TOS, TAS and OSI levels were measured. Serum MDA, TOS and IMA concentrations were significantly higher in women with ovarian torsion than in the healthy control group. However, serum TAS, TOS and OSI concentrations were significantly higher in women without ovarian torsion than within the healthy control group. Only IMA significantly distinguished patients with or without ovarian torsion. The best IMA value, according to the receiver operating characteristic curve, was 0.7045 absorbance units, with 90.00% sensitivity and 92.31% specificity. The patients in the ovarian torsion group had significantly lower serum TAS and OSI levels compared with patients without ovarian torsion. The elevated serum IMA levels with high sensitivity-specificity values observed in women with ovarian torsion seem to have a potential role as a serum marker in the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian torsion in emergency settings."

An advanced abdominal pregnancy with a good fetal and maternal outcome is therefore a more extraordinary occurrence in the modern developed world. We present a case of an abdominal pregnancy at 33.4 weeks in an individual with no documented prenatal care, who arrived in a hospital in the Bronx, in June 25th 2014, with symptoms of generalized, severe lower abdominal pain. Upon examination it was found that due to category III fetal tracing an emergent cesarean section was performed. At the time of laparotomy the fetus was located in the pelvis covered by the uterine serosa, with distortion of the entire right adnexa and invasion to the right parametrium. The placenta invaded the pouch of Douglas and the lower part of the sigmoid colon. A massive hemorrhage followed, followed by a supracervical hysterectomy. A viable infant was delivered and mother discharged on postoperative day 4."

Although initial pregnancy test results were positive, no gestational sac (GS) was seen in the uterus and the patient was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and underwent emergency laparoscopic surgery. A 20-mm, fetus-like solid mass was noted inside the GS-like cystic tumor of the left fallopian tube.

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association between the risk of ectopic pregnancy (EP) and the use of common contraceptives during the previous and current conception/menstrual cycle. A multi-center case-control study was conducted in Shanghai. Women diagnosed with EP were recruited as the case group (n = 2,411). Women with intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) (n = 2,416) and non-pregnant women (n = 2,419) were matched as controls at a ratio of 1∶1. Information regarding the previous and current use of contraceptives was collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidential intervals (CIs). Previous use of intrauterine devices (IUDs) was associated with a slight risk of ectopic pregnancy (AOR1 = 1.87 [95% CI: 1.48-2.37]; AOR2 = 1.84 [1.49-2.27]), and the risk increased with the duration of previous use (P1 for trend <10-4, P2 for trend <10-4). The current use of most contraceptives reduced the risk of both unwanted IUP (condom: AOR = 0.04 [0.03-0.05]; withdrawal method: AOR = 0.10 [0.07-0.13]; calendar rhythm method: AOR = 0.54 [0.40-0.73]; oral contraceptive pills [OCPs]: AOR = 0.03 [0.02-0.08]; levonorgestrel emergency contraception [LNG-EC]: AOR = 0.22 [0.16-0.30]; IUDs: AOR = 0.01 [0.005-0.012]; tubal sterilization: AOR = 0.01 [0.001-0.022]) and unwanted EP (condom: AOR1 = 0.05 [0.04-0.06]; withdrawal method: AOR1 = 0.13 [0.09-0.19]; calendar rhythm method: AOR1 = 0.66 [0.48-0.91]; OCPs: AOR1 = 0.14 [0.07-0.26]; IUDs: AOR1 = 0.17 [0.13-0.22]; tubal sterilization: AOR1 = 0.04 [0.02-0.08]). However, when contraception failed and pregnancy occurred, current use of OCPs (AOR2 = 4.06 [1.64-10.07]), LNG-EC (AOR2 = 4.87 [3.88-6.10]), IUDs (AOR2 = 21.08 [13.44-33.07]), and tubal sterilization (AOR2 = 7.68 [1.69-34.80]) increased the risk of EP compared with the non-use of contraceptives. Current use of most contraceptives reduce the risk of both IUP and EP. However, if the contraceptive method fails, the proportions of EP may be higher than those of non-users. In the case of contraceptive failure in the current cycle, EP cases should be differentiated according to current use of OCPs, LNG-EC, IUDs, and tubal sterilization. In addition, attention should be paid to women with previous long-term use of IUDs."

A 16-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with progressive abdominal pain and a previous history of renal and anal abnormalities. Acute appendicitis was suspected because of both tenderness on pressure and rebound tenderness, and a raised C-reactive protein level. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a cystic structure, probably of ovarian or tubal origin. An emergency laparoscopy was performed as ovarian torsion was suspected. This revealed uterine didelphys with an abnormal right horn. Additional abdominal MRI scan diagnostic revealed abnormalities consistent with HWWS.

We report a 29-year-old postpartum woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe right flank pain, nausea and anorexia initially considered as renal colic. After further investigation, OT caused by large mucinous cyst was diagnosed. Right-sided salpingo-oophorectomy was performed due to hemorrhagic ovary and huge cystic mass causing ischemic OT. OT is often diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, including severe, sharp, sudden onset of unilateral lower abdominal pain and tenderness with a palpable laterouterine pelvic mass and nausea/vomiting. Emergency surgical intervention should be performed if OT is suspected to confirm the diagnosis and uncoil the twist to prevent ovarian damage. In conclusion, emergency physicians should be aware of the possibility of OT in postpartum women. Therefore, early and timely surgical intervention should be undertaken."

The absence of free fluid and adnexal masses by ultrasound combined with the absence of ectopic risk factors are used to place women in a \"low-risk\" category. We believe that women in a \"low-risk\" category with a β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) below 3,000 mIU/mL can be discharged with only an emergency department (ED) ultrasound, provided there is 48 to 72 hours obstetric follow-up. Follow-up encounters from August 2010 to March 2011 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were women who only received an ED performed indeterminate ultrasound and an acute follow-up appointment with concern for ectopic pregnancy. Forty-nine women met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine women (59.2%, 95% CI: 45.4%-73%) had a spontaneous abortion; 18 women (36.7%, 95% CI: 23.2%-50.2%) had a normal pregnancy, and 2 women (4.1%, 95% CI: 1.5%-9.7%) had an ectopic pregnancy. Both ectopic pregnancies had no risk factors with β-hCG values of 96 and 197 mIU/mL. This study suggests that low-risk indeterminate pregnancies by an ED ultrasound and β-hCG level <3,000 mIU/mL can be safely discharged without formal ultrasonography provided a 48 to 72 hours follow-up with an obstetrician."

Secondary amenorrhea with abdominopelvic pain and metrorrhagia was the reason for admission in 56.5% of cases. Ultrasound in early pregnancy is infrequent in Conakry. Almost all of our patients underwent emergency surgery (80.2%) More than half of the ectopic pregnancies were located in the ampulla of the uterine tubes (73.0%). There were three abdominal pregnancies and 2 ovarian. In all cases the treatment was surgical, most often salpingectomy. Postoperative complications occurred in 35.1% of cases, most often anemia (27.9% of all cases) requiring blood transfusion in 11.7% of all cases before, during, or after surgery. The maternal death rate was 1.8%. Ectopic pregnancy remains a major concern at Ignace Deen CHU.

The records of 150 patients seen in the six-month period from January 1 to July 30, 2008 were examined. Data were extracted pertaining to age, time to see an emergency room doctor, time taken for ultrasound examination to be obtained from the radiology department and the ultrasound findings. Fifty-four per cent presented to the Emergency Department with a complaint of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain, 29% with bleeding only, 16% with abdominal pain only and one with syncope. One hundred and sixteen of the patients enrolled had an ultrasound performed at UHWI. The average waiting time for an ultrasound was 3.8 ± 2.5 hours. The majority (66/116) of the patients had an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) demonstrated on ultrasound. Twenty-nine had no IUP, free fluid or adnexal mass. These 95 patients would likely have been discharged home. Ten patients had an adnexal mass with or without free fluid, and ten had free fluid only on ultrasound. One patient was found to have a definite ectopic pregnancy. These 21 patients would have been referred for evaluation by the obstetrician on call for further management. The majority of patients had sonographic findings that would have allowed safe and timely discharge from the Emergency Department had ultrasound been available at the point of care. Las pacientes embarazadas con sangrado vaginal en el primer trimestre son atendidas comúnmente en el Departamento de Emergencia (DE) del Hospital Universitario de West Indies (HUWI), Kingston, Jamaica. El protocolo para el tratamiento de estas pacientes requiere que se hagan una evaluación ecográfica con el fin de localizar el embarazo donde quiera que esté, y ayudar a determinar el riesgo de un embarazo ectópico. Los exámenes de ultrasonido se realizan en el Departamento de Radiología. Este estudio retrospectivo se realizó con el propósito de evaluar cuánto tiempo las pacientes esperan por un ultrasonido pélvico. También intentamos determinar cuántas pacientes tuvieron resultados ecográficos que habrían permitido que se les diera de alta para regresar seguras a su casa. Se examinaron las historias de 150 pacientes atendidas en el período de seis meses desde el 1ero de enero al 30 de julio de 2008. Se extrajeron datos en relación con la edad, el tiempo para ver a un médico de emergencia, el tiempo necesario para hacerse un examen en el Departamento de Radiología y obtener los resultados del ultrasonido. El cincuenta y cuatro por ciento acudió al Departamento de Emergencia aquejadas de sangramiento vaginal y dolor abdominal, el 29% con sangramiento vaginal solamente, 16% con dolor abdominal solamente, y una con un síncope. A ciento dieciséis de las pacientes inscritas se les hizo un ultrasonido en UHWI. El tiempo de espera promedio para un ultrasonido fue 3.8 ± 2.5 horas. La mayoría (66/116) de las pacientes tuvo un embarazo intrauterino (EIU) comprobado por ultrasonido. Veintinueve no tuvieron EIU, ni líquido libre o masa anexial. A estas 95 pacientes probablemente se les hubiera dado de alta. Diez pacientes tuvieron una masa anexial con o sin líquido libre, y diez tuvieron líquido libre sólo en el ultrasonido. Se halló que una paciente tenía un embarazo ectópico definido. Estas 21 pacientes habrían sido remitidas para evaluación por el obstetra de guardia a fin de que recibieran tratamiento ulterior. La mayoría de las pacientes tuvieron resultados ecográficos que habrían permitido que se les diera de alta del Departamento de Emergencias de manera segura y oportuna, si hubiera habido servicio de ultrasonido en el lugar donde se les atendió."

    "abstract": "Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant trophoblastic neoplasm. Its association with ectopic pregnancy is very rare and usually with aggressive behavior. We report a new case arising in an interstitial pregnancy occurring in a 46-year-old woman. The patient was admitted for severe pelvic pain and abundant metrorrhagia. One month ago, she had had a laparoscopic resection of an interstitial pregnancy subsequent to failure of chemotherapy by methotrexate. The raise of serum βhCG level and the hyperechoic intrauterine mass were in favor of gestational trophoblastic disease. Urgent laparotomy was performed for circulatory collapse. Hysterectomy was done. Histological examination revealed a choriocarcinoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy. Two years later, neither metastasis nor recurrence was detected. Clinical diagnosis of primary interstitial choriocarcinoma is difficult, since it is rare and manifesting by non-specific abnormal vaginal bleeding. Imaging findings are also not helpful in ectopic location. The frequency of metastasis is related to the delayed diagnosis. Serial measurement of βhCG level was the most useful marker of diagnosis and follow up. Histopathological examination remains the only tool of the precise diagnosis. Choriocarcinoma has a very good prognosis even in advanced stages, since it is very chemosensitive. The current trend of the treatment of ectopic pregnancy by conservative surgery requires adequate monitoring of βhCG and careful examination of pathologic specimens to avoid misdiagnosis of ectopic gestational trophoblastic disease."

    "abstract": "The management of emergencies in Jehovah's Witnesses presents several challenges to obstetricians and gynaecologists. We present two cases of ectopic pregnancies in Jehovah's Witnesses recently managed in our institution. This is the first case review series of its kind that we could identify. We feel it is of clinical importance for all physicians caring for Jehovah's Witnesses. The first patient was a 28-year-old Caucasian Irish woman who presented in a state of collapse and a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was suspected. She refused treatment and took her own discharge against the advice of senior hospital staff. She re-presented to our Emergency Room 6 hours later in hypovolaemic shock. She ultimately consented to blood products including plasma and platelets and underwent laparoscopic left-sided salpingectomy. This consent was queried postoperatively by her next-of-kin but the validity of her consent was clarified by the hospital legal team.The second patient was a 35-year-old Nigerian woman who presented to our Emergency Room with a 2-week history of intermittent vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain with a haemoglobin of 5.4 g/dL. An ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed following assessment. She refused all blood products and underwent right-sided salpingectomy. Intravenous tranexamic acid was administered and cell salvage employed intraoperatively. We feel that this case review series emphasises the importance of appropriate management of Jehovah's Witnesses in our units. In both of the above cases, these women were in potentially life-threatening situations. Advances in haematology and pharmaceutical therapy contributed to their survival. We welcome these advances in the treatment of this patient population."

The patient's menstrual cycle was irregular, from 30-45 days. An ultrasound examination showed suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy with a betaHCG level of 1358 IU/L. Due to the presence of liquid in the pouch of Douglas the patient underwent emergency laparoscopy, which showed the presence of tumor mass between the right Fallopian tube and the appendix. These two structures associated with adhesions corresponded to secondary implantation after spontaneous tubal abortion which was confirmed by histopathologic analysis. Laparoscopy has emerged as the\"gold standard\"in the diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy, in this case the secondary abdominal pregnancy. From the diagnostic point of view, all women of reproductive age should be considered pregnant until proven otherwise, also keeping in mind that ectopic pregnancies can have different locations and many clinical features."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies are a serious gynaecological emergency that can be fatal. As such, prompt diagnosis and safe timely treatment is essential. Here, we review the literature on the development of molecularly targeted diagnostics and therapeutics for ectopic pregnancy. A blood-based biomarker that accurately identifies an ectopic pregnancy could be used to offer early diagnostic certainty in cases where ultrasound cannot determine the location of the embryo ('a pregnancy of unknown location'). Molecules examined so far can be broadly grouped into biological themes of relevance to reproduction: (i) Fallopian tube (dys)function, (ii) embryo/trophoblast growth, (iii) corpus luteum function, (iv) inflammation, (v) uterine function and (vi) angiogenesis. While a sensitive and specific biomarker for ectopic pregnancy has yet to be identified, it is possible that improvements in platform technologies or a multi-modal biomarker approach may yield an accurate diagnostic biomarker test. Furthermore, with the advent of better imaging technology, the need for a blood-based biomarker test may be superseded by improvements in ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging technology. There have been some recent preclinical studies describing molecularly targeted therapeutic approaches for ectopic pregnancy. Notably, bench-to-bedside studies have examined the use of combination gefitinib (orally available epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) and methotrexate. Preclinical studies suggest that combination gefitinib and methotrexate is highly effective in inducing placental cell death, and is significantly more effective than methotrexate alone. In early human trials, encouraging preliminary efficacy data have shown that combination gefitinib and methotrexate can rapidly resolve tubal ectopic pregnancies, and large extra-tubal ectopic pregnancies. If a large clinical randomized controlled trial confirms these findings, combination gefitinib and methotrexate could become a new medical treatment option for ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) is a true surgical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and therapy. There are conflicting reports on the accuracy of different imaging modalities for OT. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of all the published studies on B-mode ultrasound (US, morphological criteria), Doppler US (DUS, flow criteria), and computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of OT. Methods: The medical literature from 1987 to 2013 was searched for studies that evaluated US, DUS, CT, or combination of these techniques to diagnose OT in children using PubMed/MEDLINE database. The studies were screened and included if the quality criteria were met. Data were extracted using a standardized form. Reported sensitivities and specificities were pooled with 95% confidence intervals using a RevMan version 5.1 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, United Kingdom). A total of 18 US studies with 716 combined patients were included, along with 15 DUS studies comprising of 1,021 patients, and 5 CT studies with a total of 107 patients. All studies reported sensitivities, while only few selected studies also reported specificities. Using morphological criteria on B-mode US (including absolute or relative ovarian size, echotexture, location, and configuration) yielded high sensitivity and specificity (average 92 and 96%, respectively); DUS was highly specific, but lacked sensitivity, while CT was the least sensitive test. CT specificities could not be calculated from the available data. This study found considerable variability of the reported sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of OT across all evaluated imaging modalities. Interestingly, B-mode US was the most sensitive and specific examination to detect OT. Some authors reported high diagnostic accuracy of DUS as well, but these findings have not been universally reproduced. CT had low overall sensitivity and is not recommended for the workup of suspected OT."

    "abstract": "Ulipristal acetate (UPA) was licensed as an emergency contraceptive (EC) in Europe in 2009. By the end of May 2013, over 1.4 million courses had been used. The rationale for using UPA for EC in favor of the much more commonly used levonorgestrel (LNG) is based on data on efficacy, safety and side effects. In two large clinical trials among women presenting for EC up to 120 hours after unprotected sex, UPA was as effective as LNG at preventing pregnancy. When the two trials were combined in a meta analysis UPA was superior, almost halving the risk of pregnancy compared with LNG. Biomedical studies have shown that UPA inhibits or delays ovulation more effectively than LNG at a stage of the cycle when the risk of pregnancy is highest. Safety and side effects: UPA and LNG have similar side effect profiles and to date no serious adverse events have been attributed to use of UPA for EC. Data on pregnancies conceived in association with UPA use are reassuring. There is no evidence for teratogenesis or for any increased risk of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. Use of UPA will remain limited until it is available without a doctor's prescription."

A 35-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2, presented to the Emergency Room with the complaint of pelvic cramping and vaginal spotting. Initial quantitative serum beta-hCG value was 79,506.7 mIU/mL. Obstetrical ultrasound demonstrated a single, live pregnancy of approximately 8 weeks' gestation located within the endocervical canal. Pelvic MRI confirmed a live cervical ectopic pregnancy. Following discussion of management options, the decision was made to employ uterine artery embolization (UAE). Subsequent to UAE and by hospital day 4, no embryonic cardiac activity was noted. Postdischarge day 12 gynecologic ultrasound demonstrated a small, complex endocervical fluid collection compatible with resolving cervical pregnancy. If clinical circumstances are amenable to trial of embolization, interventional radiology should be consulted for cervical ectopic pregnancy management. In cases in which there may be relative contraindications to methotrexate therapy alone and there is desire to avoid hysterectomy, clinicians should give consideration to a combination of strategies, including UAE, to manage cervical pregnancy. The case report highlights a review of the current literature and discusses options for conservative cervical ectopic pregnancy management."

This organ seems to be ideal for the laparoscopic approach. To evaluate the usefulness of laparoscopy in surgery of lesions located in the ovaries in patients under 18 years of age and assess the risk of changes in the ovaries in girls with acute abdominal symptoms. Retrospective evaluation of hospital records of the period 1996-2012 from a single hospital was performed. 105 laparoscopic procedures of ovarian pathology in patients aged 0-18 (mean: 13.5) years were reviewed. The overall sample was divided into groups depending on the indication and mode of surgery. Group I: elective or emergency surgery, imaging findings of ovarian cysts bigger than 5 cm or causing pain. Group II: elective surgery, the ovarian tumor visible in imaging (solid mass or mixed). Group III: treatment for acute abdomen, without visible ovarian pathology in the preoperative imaging studies. Group IV: elective treatment of other indications, incidental finding. There were no deaths or major complications. There were no conversions. Average length of hospital stay after surgery was 2.5 days. The risk of appendicitis in patients referred for surgery due to ovarian cysts visualized in ultrasound, in the factual absence of ovarian pathology (false positive ultrasound), in the presented material was 5.2%. The risk of lesions in the ovaries in patients operated on due to acute abdominal pain, with no findings in the pre-operative ultrasound (false negative ultrasound), in the presented material was 7.4%. The risk of coexistence of changes in the ovaries with appendicitis found during the procedure due to acute abdominal pain in the study group was 6%. The laparoscopic treatment for ovarian masses is safe and efficient. The risk of wrong preoperative diagnosis (ovary mass vs. appendicitis) is in any direction between 5 and 8%, which is a number large enough to be taken into consideration when surgical training and legislation is concerned."

    "abstract": "With cesarean section rates increasing worldwide, clarity regarding negative effects is essential. This study aimed to investigate the rate of subsequent stillbirth, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy following primary cesarean section, controlling for confounding by indication. We performed a population-based cohort study using Danish national registry data linking various registers. The cohort included primiparous women with a live birth between January 1, 1982, and December 31, 2010 (n = 832,996), with follow-up until the next event (stillbirth, miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy) or censoring by live birth, death, emigration, or study end. Cox regression models for all types of cesarean sections, sub-group analyses by type of cesarean, and competing risks analyses for the causes of stillbirth were performed. An increased rate of stillbirth (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.01, 1.28) was found in women with primary cesarean section compared to spontaneous vaginal delivery, giving a theoretical absolute risk increase (ARI) of 0.03% for stillbirth, and a number needed to harm (NNH) of 3,333 women. Analyses by type of cesarean section showed similarly increased rates for emergency (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01, 1.31) and elective cesarean (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91, 1.35), although not statistically significant in the latter case. An increased rate of ectopic pregnancy was found among women with primary cesarean overall (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04, 1.15) and by type (emergency cesarean, HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03, 1.15, and elective cesarean, HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03, 1.21), yielding an ARI of 0.1% and a NNH of 1,000 women for ectopic pregnancy. No increased rate of miscarriage was found among women with primary cesarean, with maternally requested cesarean section associated with a decreased rate of miscarriage (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60, 0.85). Limitations include incomplete data on maternal body mass index, maternal smoking, fertility treatment, causes of stillbirth, and maternally requested cesarean section, as well as lack of data on antepartum/intrapartum stillbirth and gestational age for stillbirth and miscarriage. This study found that cesarean section is associated with a small increased rate of subsequent stillbirth and ectopic pregnancy. Underlying medical conditions, however, and confounding by indication for the primary cesarean delivery account for at least part of this increased rate. These findings will assist women and health-care providers to reach more informed decisions regarding mode of delivery. Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary."

Data analysis was by descriptive statistics using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software, version 17.0 for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). A total of 232 gynecologists working in 52 different secondary and tertiary health facilities participated in the survey. The mean age of the respondents was 42.6 ± 9.1 years (range 28-70 years). The proportion of gynecologists reporting that women with early miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy were first managed within the hospital general emergency room was 92%. The mean reported interval between arrival in hospital and first ultrasound scan was 4.9 ± 1.4 hours (range ½-8 hours). Transvaginal scan was stated as the routine initial imaging investigation by only 17.2% of respondents. Approximately 94.8% of respondents felt that dedicated early pregnancy services were feasible and should be introduced to improve the care of women with early miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Reported protocols for managing early miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy in many health facilities in Nigeria appear to engender unnecessary delays and avoidable costs, and dedicated early pregnancy services could be both useful and feasible in addressing these shortcomings in the way women with such conditions are currently managed."

We describe the case of a 41-year-old white caucasian woman admitted to the emergency room due to abdominal pain for two days. The ultrasounds scan and the quantification of beta-HCG led to the diagnosis of tubal ectopic pregnancy, although she had been hysterectomized two years before. An emergency laparoscopy was performed for salpingectomy. The pathology report indicated trophoblastic tubal implantation and hematosalpinx. Ectopic pregnancy is one of the conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in women of child bearing potential, and the absence of the uterus does not rule out its diagnosis."

Evaluation of the newly released Abbott i-STAT β-hCG point-of-care assay with the Beckman Coulter β-hCG laboratory assay in use. Whole blood, plasma and serum samples with a wide range of β-hCG concentrations were analysed by both methods. The Abbott I-STAT β-hCG compares favourably, can be performed on heparinised whole blood, plasma and serum, and shows acceptable accuracy and precision. However a hook effect at elevated β-hCG was shown in gestational trophoblastic disease as well as normal pregnancies. The i-STAT β-hCG performs acceptably in its intended use in the early detection of pregnancy, but results should always be interpreted within the clinical context, as a hook effect may occur."

Emergency laparoscopy was done and bilateral ovarian torsion with retained vascularity was noted. Bilateral detorsion with ovarian puncture and ovariopexy was performed. A review of international literature suggests that this is the first case reported with bilateral ovarian torsion following spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a singleton pregnancy."

The trainees were asked about their competence level in a diagnostic laparoscopy; a salpingectomy; a salpingotomy; and an oophorectomy/cystectomy for adnexal torsion. Subsequently, they were asked how they would manage a tubal ectopic pregnancy with contralateral tubal disease. We received 202 responses (26%) and of these: 79% of trainees can perform a diagnostic laparoscopy independently; 32% can perform a salpingectomy and 12% can perform a salpingotomy independently; 14% can manage an adnexal torsion without supervision."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of ovarian torsion is 4.9 among 100,000 females between ages 1 to 20 years. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion in children, especially in infants, is very difficult. Since they cannot explain related symptoms accurately, and reproductive organs lie high in the abdomen, physical examination shows unclear findings. For these reasons, we use imaging studies, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, to diagnose ovarian torsion. However, it is of limited value to diagnose by using these modalities alone. Therefore, clinical suspicion is important for diagnosis. Though pediatric laparoscopic surgery was introduced 20 years ago, it has been widely performed since the mid 1990s with the development of 3-mm instruments. In addition, usually the pediatric operation is done in the pediatric surgery office, even though it is a gynecologic procedure. In addition, laparotomy is still more frequently conducted in current clinical practice, although the frequency of laparoscopic surgery has increased. However, it is thought that expert gynecologic surgeons can perform pediatric laparoscopic operations if they pay attention to some precautions. We report herein the case of a 14-month-old infant who underwent emergency laparoscopic untwisting of ovarian torsion successfully without complications by a gynecologic surgeon, with a brief review of the literature."

Transvaginal ultrasound or other imaging modalities cannot be completely relied upon to exclude heterotopic pregnancy from the differential diagnosis of pregnant patients with abdominal pain. A 32-year-old woman, G5 P3105, presented to the emergency room with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain. Ultrasound demonstrated an approximately 8-week intrauterine pregnancy. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy for suspected torsion of a right ovarian cyst. Repeat exploratory laparotomy was required due to symptomatic anemia. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathology results demonstrated a right tubal ectopic pregnancy. Surgical and medical options exist for heterotopic pregnancy management. Despite negative heterotopic pregnancy results for transvaginal ultrasound, the possibility of heterotopic pregnancy should remain within the differential diagnosis of any pregnant patient with either natural or assisted reproduction technology intrauterine pregnancy who presents with abdominal pain and/or clinical signs of ectopic pregnancy."

Endometrium was heteregenous and incompatible with a normal intrauterine pregnancy. She had a history of antagonist protocol/controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) started 38 days ago in a different in vitro fertilization (IVF) center. Because of the fertilization failure, she had no embryo transfer. With ectopic pregnancy diagnosis, we made surgical exploration and observed a material which was consistent with ectopic pregnancy on the right tuba uterina. Partial salpingectomy was applied because of actively bleeding ectopic pregnancy. Two days after discharging from hospital; she presented to emergency room again with syncope and generalized tonic-clonic seizure. By cranial tomography generalized edema, cerebral venous thrombosis was established. Enoxaparine sodium 0.6 ml twice daily was administered. Six days after hospitalisation, she was discharged with normal neurological examination under phenytoin 200 mg daily and enoxaparine sodium 0.6 ml daily. Before ART treatment, clinicians must always rule out the likelihood of existing pregnancy by measuring estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). On the other hand, low-molecularweight heparine may be effective in cerebral venous thrombosis treatment. Therefore, intracerebral thrombosis is one of the rare mortal complications of ART."

    "abstract": "Adnexal torsion is an infrequent and serious gynecologic surgical emergency. Adnexal torsion may result from pre-existing tubal or ovarian pathology or hyperstimulation of the ovary during ovulation. Early diagnosis and emergency surgical treatment (detorsion) are important to preserve fertility and to prevent peritonitis or loss of the adnexa. However, during reperfusion, tissue damage is more severe than during ischemia because of oxygen-derived radicals. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effect of gradual detorsion on adnexal torsion. Twenty-one adult female rats were divided into three groups as sham-operated (Sh group, n = 7); torsion + detorsion (TD group, n = 7); and torsion + gradual detorsion (TGD group, n = 7). A midline laparotomy was performed under anesthesia. In the TD and TGD groups, the left adnexa along with tubal and ovarian vessels were twisted three times in a clockwise direction and fixed to the abdominal wall. After 30 h, detorsion was performed on the mesenteries of both TD and TGD groups. In the TGD group, however, detorsion was performed gradually: the ovarian mesentery was detorsioned 360°, followed by a 5-min pause, then a repeat of the cycle until full detorsion was achieved. Rats were killed 1 week later. Left ovaries were removed and evaluated histopathologically. The histopathological mean grade was significantly higher in the TD than in the TGD group (p < 0.05). Gradual detorsion can reduce reperfusion injury in a rat model of ovarian torsion. This method is easily applicable and may be a useful method for human patients with ovarian torsion."

This is a retrospective study of 20 cases of ovarian torsion and 20 control patients, all of whom had both US and CT performed in the emergency department. Two radiologists who were blinded to clinical data interpreted all studies as (1) demonstrating an abnormal ovary or not, and (2) suggestive of torsion or not. Sensitivity, specificity and interobserver variation were calculated for each imaging modality. Pelvic US was interpreted as demonstrating an abnormal ovary in 90.0% of ovarian torsion cases by reader 1, and in 100.0% by reader 2, whereas CT was interpreted as revealing an abnormal ovary in 100.0% of torsion cases by both readers. Pelvic US for ovarian torsion was 80.0% sensitive (95% CI, 58.4-91.9%) and 95.0% specific (95% CI, 76.4-99.1%) for reader 1, while 80.0% sensitive (95% CI, 58.4-91.9%) and 85.0% specific (95% CI, 64.0-95.0%) for reader 2. Interobserver agreement for pelvic US was fair (Kappa=0.60). Abdominopelvic CT for ovarian torsion was 100.0% sensitive (95% CI, 83.9-100.0%) and 85.0% specific (95% CI, 64.0-94.5%) for reader 1, while 90.0% sensitive (95% CI, 69.9-97.2%) and 90.0% specific (95% CI, 69.9-97.2%) for reader 2. Interobserver agreement was excellent (Kappa=0.85). The diagnostic performance of CT is not shown to be significantly different from that of US in identifying ovarian torsion in this study. These results suggest that when CT demonstrates findings of ovarian torsion, the performance of another imaging exam (i.e. US) that delays therapy is unlikely to improve preoperative diagnostic yield."

Transvaginal ultrasound revealed an echo-free space with mosaic echo pattern in the right adnexal area and no gestational sac in the uterus. With a preoperative diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy, emergency laparotomy was performed. The rectouterine pouch was filled with many clots containing small amounts of villous tissue. After removal of the conceptus, which was infiltrating into the peritoneum of the Pouch of Douglas, bleeding was controlled by Argon laser. Histological examination of the conceptus by immunohistochemical staining with p57(kip2) showed features of complete hydatidiform mole. This case demonstrates that the peritoneum in the Pouch of Douglas is a possible site of ectopic complete hydatidiform mole occurrence and that immunohistochemical stain is useful to confirm the diagnosis of ectopic complete hydatidiform mole."

Recurrent ectopic pregnancy in the ipsilateral fallopian tube is rare, but it is important to be suspicious of the diagnosis to prevent serious morbidity.

    "abstract": "We report a case of a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the emergency department complaining of diffuse abdominal pain for five days, associated with nausea, vomiting and constipation. Physical examination disclosed a large incarcerated umbilical hernia, which was readily apparent on supine abdominal plain films. These also showed a calcified heterogeneous mass in the mid-abdominal region, which was further characterized by CT as a lithopedion (calcified ectopic pregnancy). This is one of the few cases studied on a MDCT equipment, and it clearly enhances the post-processing abilities of this imaging method which allows diagnostic high-quality MIP images. Lithopedion is a rare entity, with less than 300 cases previously described in the medical literature. However, many reported cases corresponded to cases of skeletonization or collections of fetal bone fragments discovered encysted in the pelvic region at surgery or autopsy. It is thus estimated that true lithopedion is a much rarer entity. The diagnosis may be reached by a suggestive clinical history and a palpable mass on physical examination, while the value of modern cross-sectional techniques is still virtually unknown. Ultrasonography may depict an empty uterine cavity and a calcified abdominal mass of non-specific characteristics, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging are able to reach a conclusive diagnosis and may additionally define the involvement of adjacent structures. The differential diagnosis includes other calcified pathologic situations, including ovarian tumors, uterine fibroids, urinary tract neoplasms, inflammatory masses or epiploic calcifications."

Retrospective analysis of published data sources and published cost-effectiveness model. Women presenting in primary care in England for EHC within 24 or 72 h of unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI). EHC of either LNG (1.5 mg) or UPA (30 mg). The primary outcome measure is the number and direct and indirect costs of an unintended pregnancy. The secondary outcome measure is the consequence of unintended pregnancy: miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth or live birth. From the comparative clinical studies of EHC we observe that if 125 women receive either LNG or UPA within 72 h of UPSI, there will be one less pregnancy due to method failure in the UPA group than in the LNG group. We calculate the cost of an unintended pregnancy to be £1663 in direct healthcare costs rising to £2922 with the inclusion of social costs. Using these costs in the comparative cost-effectiveness model shows that it costs £194 less in direct health costs alone to prevent one more pregnancy with UPA than with LNG. The inclusion of social costs of pregnancy increases this cost-saving potential to £1453 for each extra pregnancy avoided with UPA compared with LNG. Clinical trials have demonstrated the superior efficacy of UPA compared with LNG as a method of EHC. Given that it costs less overall in health and social costs of pregnancy while preventing more pregnancies, UPA is said to be the dominant treatment, and primary care services should shift to offering UPA as the preferred oral option to women presenting within 24 and 72 h of UPSI."

    "abstract": "Are there improvements in the accuracy of prediction of ectopic pregnancy (EP) in women with early symptomatic pregnancy using human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) curves when clinicians consider visits beyond the first 48 h after initial presentation? Two hCG values, measured 48 h (2 days) apart, are often not sufficient to accurately predict the outcome of a woman with a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL), but adding a third visit on Day 4 or 7 significantly improved the prediction for 1 in 15 women. The use of serial hCG values is commonly used to aid in the prediction of the final diagnosis in women with a PUL. Initial outcome predictions based on two hCG values may often be incorrect. This retrospective multicenter cohort study included 646 women with a PUL, recruited over 2 years. Of these women, 146 were ultimately diagnosed with EP. Women presenting to the emergency room with first trimester pain or bleeding, with a PUL, at least 2 hCG values and a definitive final diagnosis from the University of Pennsylvania, University of Miami and University of Southern California, were recruited from 2007 to 2009. Using currently recommended prediction rules, adding a third hCG evaluation on Day 4 after initial presentation significantly improved the accuracy of initial prediction from the first two values (48 h apart, or Day 2) by 9.3% (P = 0.015). Adding a third value on Day 7 improved prediction significantly by 6.7% (P = 0.031), compared with prediction based on first two values. The improvement in prediction by assessing four hCG values (Days 0, 2, 4 and 7) compared with three values (Days 0, 2 and 4) was 1.3% and not statistically significant. Missing data imputation likely biased results toward the null; predicted outcomes may not match those made by clinicians; and the study does not predict intrauterine pregnancy and spontaneous miscarriage separately. This study provides useful information for the prediction of outcomes for women with a symptomatic first trimester pregnancy of unknown location, but may not be generalizable to all pregnant women.

    "abstract": "A cornual gestation is one of the most hazardous types of ectopic gestations, which accounts for 2 - 4% of all the ectopic pregnancies and it has a mortality rate which is 6 - 7 times higher than that of the ectopics in general. The diagnosis and the treatment of such a pregnancy is challenging and it constitutes an urgent medical situation. Because of the myometrial stretch ability, they tend to present relatively late, at 7 - 12 weeks of gestation. A significant maternal haemorrhage which can lead to hypovolaemia and shock, can rapidly result from a cornual rupture. We are reporting a case of 28 year old woman who presented to the emergency obstetrical room in a state of hypovolaemic shock. The diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was confirmed in view of the history of 10 weeks of amenorrhoea, with a positive urine pregnancy test. She was shifted for emergency exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, we encountered a left lateral wall ruptured uterus with a 10 week old foetus in the peritoneal cavity, which suggested a left cornual ectopic pregnancy which had ended up as a catastrophic event. A cornual resection and repair was done successfully."

Conservative management of cesarean scar pregnancy is challenging, especially when future fertility preservation is a significant concern. Furthermore, reports on significant maternal morbidity in subsequent pregnancies after successful conservative management of cesarean scar pregnancy are limited. A 31-year-old woman with previous history of 2 cesarean sections transferred due to massive uterine hemorrhage 7 weeks after dilatation and curettage performed under the diagnosis of missed abortion at 7 weeks of gestation. Cesarean scar pregnancy was diagnosed and was conservatively managed by emergent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by multiple doses of systemic methotrexate administration. Seven months after TACE, she spontaneously conceived. At 36 weeks and 5 days of pregnancy, emergency cesarean section was performed due to sudden massive hemorrhage. Abruptio placentae was diagnosed when hysterotomy was performed. After manual removal of the placenta, a healthy infant was delivered. The postoperative course was uneventful. The pregnancy course should be carefully monitored for early detection of maternal morbidity associated with placental abnormalities to achieve successful outcome in subsequent gestations after conservative management of cesarean scar pregnancy."

The aim of this work was to determine and evaluate the incidence, clinical presentation, risk factors, and management outcomes of ectopic pregnancies at Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital (EBSUTH) in Abakaliki. This was a retrospective, descriptive study of ectopic pregnancies managed in EBSUTH during the study period (June 1, 2002 to May 31, 2012). The medical records of the patients managed for ectopic pregnancy as well as the total birth record and gynecological admission records during the period under review were retrieved, and data were collected with the aid of data-entry forms designed for this purpose. There were 4,610 gynecological admissions and 9,828 deliveries, with 215 cases of ectopic pregnancies. A total of 205 cases were suitable for analysis after excluding cases with incomplete records. The relevant data collected were analyzed with SPSS version 15.0 for Windows. Ectopic pregnancy constituted 4.5% of all gynecological admissions, and its incidence was 2.1%. The mean age of the patients was 27 ± 2 years, 196 of 205 (95.6%) had ruptured ectopic pregnancies, and the remaining nine (4.4%) were unruptured. The commonest (166 of 205, 80.0%) clinical presentation was abdominal pain, and the commonest (105 of 205, 51.2%) identified risk factor was a previous history of induced abortion. Three deaths were recorded, giving a case-fatality rate of 1.4% (three of 205). Ectopic pregnancy is a recognized cause of maternal morbidity and mortality and has remained a reproductive health challenge to Nigerian women, as well as a threat to efforts in achieving the UN's Millennium Development Goal 5 in sub-Saharan Africa."

In a retrospective cohort study at a university-affiliated medical center, records of women with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and massive hemoperitoneum (>800mL) were reviewed. Sixty women were diagnosed with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and massive hemoperitoneum: 48 underwent emergency laparoscopy; 12 underwent emergency laparotomy. There was no difference in hemodynamic status at presentation between the groups. Median operating time was significantly shorter in the laparoscopy group (50minutes [range, 43-63minutes] vs 60minutes [range, 60-72minutes]; P=0.01). Median intra-abdominal blood loss was significantly greater in the laparotomy group (1500mL [range, 1400-2000mL] vs 1000mL [range, 800-1200mL]; P=0.002). There was no difference between the groups regarding treatment with blood products, perioperative complications, and hospitalization period. In patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and massive hemoperitoneum, laparoscopy is feasible and safe, with significantly shorter operating times compared with laparotomy. While the mode of surgery should be based on the surgeon's experience and preference, the significantly lower hemoperitoneum volume associated with laparoscopy may be a reflection of shorter operating times and quicker hemorrhage control."

We present a case of abdominal pregnancy with massive peritoneal bleeding successfully treated using systemic methotrexate (MTX). A 34-year-old woman with amenorrhea for 8 weeks and a positive pregnancy test was referred for evaluation of ectopic pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasonographic scan showed a gestational sac measuring 25 mm in diameter containing a viable embryo in the cul-de-sac and a considerable amount of free fluid in the patient's lower abdomen and pelvis. Laboratory parameters showed that her hemoglobin concentration was 5.8 g/dl and serum human chorionic gonadotropin concentration was 13,195 mIU/ml. Emergency surgery revealed an abdominal pregnancy in the cul-de-sac and a massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. After a hemostasis procedure, the patient was successfully treated using systemic MTX. We also present the review of abdominal pregnancy cases treated using systemic MTX at our institution over 10 years. Systemic MTX treatment for abdominal pregnancy is safe and effective and makes it possible to avoid the risk of excessive bleeding by surgical resection of the implantation site."

The product of conception can be removed safely by laparoscopic surgery and be submitted for histological examination. The rate of ectopic pregnancies has increased from 0.5% in 1970 to 2% today. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy in all women presenting to an emergency department with first-trimester bleeding, lower abdominal pain, or a combination of the 2 is between 6% and 16%. DESIGNATION: Workup of all localizations of ectopic pregnancies at a university department of obstetrics and gynecology. Comparison of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities from the surgical laparoscopic approach to nonsurgical, medical options. Tubal pregnancies: (1) to preserve tubal function, salpingotomy, partial salpingectomy followed by laparoscopic anastomosis, or fimbrial milking is performed. (2) Tubectomy or salpingectomy is performed only in severely damaged or ruptured tubes or if the patient does not desire further pregnancies. Nontubal ectopic pregnancies (ovarian pregnancy, ectopic abdominal pregnancy, interstitial or cornual pregnancy/rudimentary horn, intraligamental and cervical pregnancies) all require their own specific treatment. The predominant drug is methotrexate, but other systemic drugs, such as actinomycin D, prostaglandins, and RU 486, can also be applied. Tubal rupture is a complication of late diagnosed tubal pregnancy that is more difficult to treat conservatively and often indicates tubectomy or segmental resection. In 5% to 15% of treated ectopic pregnancy cases, remnant conception product parts may require a final methotrexate injection. This article is a review to aid clinical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancies that now can be diagnosed earlier and treated effectively by laparoscopic surgery."

Currently, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy depends on transvaginal ultrasound and serial serum measurements of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which requires follow up. The objective of this study was to examine whether single point measurements at presentation could distinguish between women with ectopic pregnancy, viable pregnancy, and spontaneous miscarriage. Serum total hCG (hCGt), hyperglycosylated hCG (hCGh), free beta subunit of hCG (hCGβ), progesterone (P), and CA-125 were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay over a 3 month period in 441 women presenting at the emergency room with abdominal pain and a positive pregnancy test. Patient outcomes were followed and confirmed by histology. 65 samples were excluded due to poor sample storage, or lost to follow up. The pregnancy outcomes were 175 viable pregnancies, 175 spontaneous miscarriages, and 26 ectopic pregnancies. A serum hCGt <3736 mIU/mL cut off was 100% sensitive, with 76% specificity, for distinguishing ectopic pregnancy from viable pregnancy; but did not differentiate spontaneous miscarriage. Serum CA125 <41.98 U/mL produced 100% sensitivity and 43% specificity in distinguishing ectopic pregnancy from spontaneous miscarriage. Sequential application of hCGt and CA-125 cut off followed by ultrasound could detect 100% of ectopic pregnancies with 87% specificity for all intrauterine pregnancies. The combination of serum hCGt <3736 mIU/mL, followed by CA125 <41.98 U/mL is a promising algorithm for detecting all ectopic pregnancy at initial presentation."

The abusive use of synthetic cannabinoids results in anxiety, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and paranoid behavior, but the effects of maternal use of synthetic cannabinoids during pregnancy are ambiguous due to limited studies in humans and a relative short history of the drugs. In this review, we discuss the known and potential adverse effects of synthetic cannabinoids on human pregnancy using knowledge gathered from studies in mice and limited studies in humans. In mice, multiple sites and stages of pregnancy are potential targets of synthetic cannabinoids, including preimplantation embryo development, oviductal embryo transport, implantation, placentation, and parturition. It is anticipated that maternal use of synthetic cannabinoids would result in severely compromised female fertility and pregnancy outcome."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is difficult to diagnose early and accurately. Women often present at emergency departments in early pregnancy with a 'pregnancy of unknown location' (PUL), and diagnosis and exclusion of EP is challenging due to a lack of reliable biomarkers. The objective of this study was to identify novel diagnostic biomarkers for EP. Shotgun proteomics, incorporating combinatorial-ligand library pre-fractionation, was used to interrogate pooled sera (n = 40) from women undergoing surgery for EP, termination of viable intrauterine pregnancy and management of non-viable intrauterine pregnancy. Western blot was used to validate results in individual sera. ELISAs were developed to interrogate sera from women with PUL (n = 120). Sera were collected at time of first symptomatic presentation and categorized according to pregnancy outcome. The main outcome measures were differences between groups and area under the receiver operating curve (ROC). Proteomics identified six biomarker candidates. Western blot detected significant differences in levels of two of these candidates. ELISA of sera from second cohort revealed that these differences were only significant for one of these candidates, fibronectin. ROC analysis of ability of fibronectin to discriminate EP from other pregnancy outcomes suggested that fibronectin has diagnostic potential (ROC 0.6439; 95% CI 0.5090 to 0.7788; P>0.05), becoming significant when 'ambiguous' medically managed PUL excluded from analysis (ROC 0.6538; 95% CI 0.5158 to 0.7918; P<0.05).

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) is one of the most common gynecologic surgical emergencies. All age groups can be affected, but ovarian stimulation, as found during early pregnancy or infertility treatment, is a major risk factor. Diagnosing OT in early pregnancy can be challenging. Patients frequently present with abdominal pain and non-specific symptoms. Missed diagnosis of OT could lead not only to ovarian necrosis and sepsis, but also threaten the pregnancy. The objective of this article is to present a case of OT in early pregnancy and to review its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. A 30-year-old woman at 10 weeks gestational age presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with 2 h duration of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was not on ovarian stimulation treatments. A bedside ED ultrasound showed an enlarged edematous right ovary with a large cyst, but without flow on color Doppler. Immediate obstetric consultation was initiated. Eventual radiology ultrasound showed decreased but present flow in the right ovary. The patient underwent emergent laparoscopic surgery, during which the necrotic right ovary was removed. She was placed on progesterone therapy upon hospital discharge and eventually delivered a healthy term infant. Ovarian torsion in pregnancy is increasing in frequency due to the growing prevalence of ovarian stimulation treatment. Although diagnostic ultrasound is a frequently used imaging tool in patients with suspected OT, the mere presence of blood flow on Doppler ultrasonography of the adnexa has a poor negative predictive value. A high clinical suspicion and early laparoscopic management correlate with favorable maternal and fetal outcomes."

Tubal EP is well described in industrialised countries, but less is known about its impact in low-resource countries, in particular in the South Pacific Region. We undertook a retrospective review of women with tubal EP treated at a provincial referral hospital in coastal Papua New Guinea over a period of 56 months. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from patients' medical records and analysed. The institutional rate of tubal EP was calculated, and diagnosis and management reviewed. Potential risk factors for tubal EP were identified, and delays contributing to increased morbidity described. A total of 73 women had tubal EP. The institutional rate of tubal EP over the study period was 6.3 per 1,000 deliveries. There were no maternal deaths due to EP. The mean age of women was 31.5+/-5.7 years, 85% were parous, 67% were rural dwellers and 62% had a history of sub-fertility. The most commonly used diagnostic aid was culdocentesis. One third of women had clinical evidence of shock on arrival. All women with tubal EP were managed by open salpingectomy. Tubal rupture was confirmed for 48% of patients and was more common amongst rural dwellers. Forty-three percent of women had macroscopic evidence of pelvic infection. Two-thirds of patients received blood transfusions, and post-operative recovery lasted six days on average. Late presentation, lack of clinical suspicion, and delays with receiving appropriate treatments were observed. Tubal EP is a common gynaecological emergency in a referral hospital in coastal PNG, and causes significant morbidity, in particular amongst women residing in rural areas. Sexually transmitted infections are likely to represent the most important risk factor for tubal EP in PNG. Interventions to reduce the morbidity due to tubal EP include the prevention, detection and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, identification and reduction of barriers to prompt presentation, increasing health workers' awareness of ectopic pregnancy, providing pregnancy test kits to rural health centres, and strengthening hospital blood transfusion services, including facilities for autotransfusion."

Upon arrival at hospital, we performed tight and full vaginal gauze packing to push the uterus upward to control the patient's hemorrhage. Following stabilization of her general condition, she was treated with uterine artery embolization. Using angiography, the effectiveness of vaginal gauze packing for emergency hemostasis by the presumed mechanism of impairing blood flow through the uterine artery was demonstrated. To our knowledge, there are no reports that have previously demonstrated angiographic findings similar to ours after vaginal gauze packing. Vaginal gauze packing is an effective, rapid, and convenient hemostatic procedure able to be carried out in a time-sensitive and challenging situation. As a result, this procedure gives clinicians more time to improve the patients' general status and arrange for transfusion and further definitive treatment."

    "abstract": "The purposes of this study were to (1) quantify the frequency of underrecognized Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections in pregnant women tested in the emergency department (ED), (2) describe the characteristics of those not treated during the initial visit, and (3) determine how many pregnant women with acute cervicitis were lost to follow-up. This was a retrospective, cohort analysis of consecutive women seen in the ED of 3 academic medical centers during a 36-month study period, with positive results for GC/CT. Our key outcome measures were the proportion of pregnant women being untreated in the ED, the time to subsequent treatment, and the proportion lost to follow-up. During the study period, 735 female patients had positive polymerase chain reaction study results for GC and/or CT; 179 (24%) were pregnant. Overall, 143 of these pregnant patients with cervicitis (80%) were not treated in the ED. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (71%), nausea (45%), vaginal discharge (35%), vaginal bleeding (34%), and urinary complaints (22%). The most common discharge diagnoses were vaginitis (37%), urinary infection (33%), threatened abortion (19%), nonspecific abdominal pain (9%), and rule-out ectopic pregnancy (6%). Of the 143 patients with sexually transmitted infection not treated in the ED, 114 (80%) were contacted by telephone and/or mail. Twenty-nine (20%) were subsequently lost to follow-up. Further study is warranted to enhance point-of-contact testing and identify better mechanismsfor contact and follow-up after ED discharge and more liberal policies to treat less symptomatic patients empirically."

    "title": "Heterotopic pregnancy: a report of two cases.",
    "abstract": "Background: A heterotopic pregnancy is defined as the presence of a concomitant intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy. Its estimated incidence is 1/30,000 in spontaneous pregnancies. It is also reported to be as high as 1 in 3900 when the pregnancy is a result of assisted reproductive technology (ART). However, clomiphene citrate (CC) could be associated with a higher rate of heterotopic pregnancy as it amplifies the rate of twinning. Furthermore, heterotopic pregnancies are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for obstetricians. If undiagnosed, they are associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. Case presentation: We present two cases of coincidental intra and extra-uterine pregnancy. In the first case, heterotopic pregnancy was a result of induction of ovulation with CC. There was a delay in the diagnosis of the ectopic pregnancy component resulting in an emergency laparoscopy. Fortunately, after the laparoscopy the intrauterine pregnancy was not affected and it is progressing satisfactorily. Alternatively, the second case occurred spontaneously and was treated with methotrexate as the intrauterine pregnancy miscarried on its own accord. Conclusions: These cases highlight the fact that as clinicians, we should be aware of the possibility of a heterotopic pregnancy in any patient presenting with pelvic pain, even when an intrauterine pregnancy has been confirmed. This is even more imperative after induction of ovulation by CC or ART. We would also like to emphasise that an early diagnosis is critical to safeguard the intrauterine pregnancy and avoid maternal morbidity and mortality due to the ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion represents a true surgical emergency. Prompt diagnosis is essential to ovarian salvage, and high clinical suspicion is important in this regard. Confounding the diagnosis in general are more commonly encountered abdominal complaints in the Emergency Department (ED) such as constipation, diarrhea, and urinary tract infections and more common surgical emergencies such as appendicitis. Prompt diagnosis can be further complicated in low-risk populations such as young children. Herein, we describe the case of a 5-year-old girl with a seemingly benign presentation of abdominal pain who was diagnosed in the ED and treated for acute ovarian torsion after two prior clinic visits. A brief discussion of evaluation, treatment, and management of ovarian torsion follows."

    "title": "Emergent complications of assisted reproduction: expecting the unexpected.",
    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of assisted reproductive technology (ART), radiologists are more likely to encounter associated complications, especially in an emergency setting. These complications include ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), ovarian torsion, and ectopic and heterotopic pregnancy. OHSS occurs following ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation and manifests with bilateral ovarian enlargement by multiple cysts, third-spacing of fluids, and clinical findings ranging from gastrointestinal discomfort to life-threatening renal failure and coagulopathy. Enlarged hyperstimulated ovaries are at risk for torsion. Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific, and ovarian torsion should be suspected and excluded in any female patient undergoing infertility treatment who presents with severe abdominal pain. The most consistent imaging finding is asymmetric enlargement of the twisted ovary. There is also an increased risk for ectopic pregnancy following ART, with a relative increased risk for rarer and more lethal forms, including interstitial and cervical ectopic pregnancies. Heterotopic pregnancy refers to simultaneous intrauterine and ectopic pregnancies and has an incidence of 1%-3% in ART patients. Careful evaluation of the adnexa is critical in this patient population, even when an intrauterine pregnancy has been confirmed. Ultrasonography is the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of complications of ART, although nonspecific symptoms may sometimes lead to cross-sectional imaging being performed. Familiarity with the multimodality imaging appearance of these entities will allow accurate and timely diagnosis and help avert potentially fatal consequences."

    "abstract": "The pharmacologic management and the nonpharmacologic management of first-trimester complications in the emergency department are reviewed. The obstetric complications most commonly seen in early pregnancy (less than 20 weeks' gestation) include ectopic pregnancy, threatened and inevitable abortions, and incomplete, complete, and missed abortions. The treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include expectant management, medical management with methotrexate, and surgery. If patients have signs and symptoms of tubal rupture, surgery must be performed immediately. In other cases, the choice of management technique is based on the patient's clinical condition, factors related to the ectopic pregnancy, and the patient's preferences. Pharmacologic therapies for women with confirmed threatened abortion include human chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone, uterine muscle relaxants, and Rh immune globulin prophylaxis. Treatment goals for women whose condition has advanced to inevitable abortion include evacuating any retained products of conception, either with expectant (conservative) management or pharmacologic or surgical intervention. The best treatment option is often determined by the mother's clinical status at the time of presentation and her preference of management strategy. Management of complete abortion may not require any further intervention; however, it is often difficult to identify a complete versus incomplete abortion. Treatment options for complete, incomplete, and missed abortions include expectant, surgical, and medical management. Ectopic pregnancy, threatened and inevitable abortions, and incomplete, complete, and missed abortions are common complications during early pregnancy. Various medical and surgical treatment options are available for managing these complications, including expectant management, medical management, and surgery."

    "abstract": "A 2.5-month-old girl with a left-sided, painful inguinal swelling for the last 2 days was brought to the emergency department. After physical examination and radiological evaluation, the diagnosis of incarcerated inguinal hernia of the ovary was made. Because of the long-standing history, she was taken to the operation room without an attempt for manual reduction. Perioperatively, the torsion of the ovary with distal fallopian tube within the indirect hernia sac was seen. As untwisting of the ovary has resulted in no change in the color, oophorectomy before hernia repair was performed.The majority of the painful inguinal swellings in the infancy are related to incarcerated hernia. The treatment option varies from manual reduction to surgical intervention, depending on the duration from beginning of swelling to the time the exact diagnosis was made. Even though the presence of short-term history and the lack of peritoneal irritation findings are indications for a manual reduction, the suspicion of an ovarian torsion should be raised for ovaries within the incarcerated inguinal hernia, and ovarian viability should be considered before an attempt of manual reduction."

    "abstract": "The rudimentary horn is a rare developmental anomaly of the Müllerian duct. Ectopic pregnancy in the rudimentary horn is estimated to occur in one out of 76,000-150,000 pregnancies. A 30-year-old primigravida suddenly collapsed after 3 days of continuous abdominal pain. Emergency laparotomy revealed a massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage and fetal demise. The growth of the fetus after 19 weeks of gestation is believed to have caused the rudimentary horn rupture, thereby rapidly leading to hemorrhagic shock in the mother and ischemic death in the fetus. This is the first autopsy report on maternal death due to the rudimentary horn or other Müllerian duct anomalies, which emphasizes the need for forensic pathologists to consider this condition as a possible cause of unexpected death in fertile women. In addition, it is very important for clinicians to detect Müllerian duct anomalies by sonography during routine obstetric examinations, and promptly diagnose anomaly related ectopic pregnancies in women displaying symptoms of an acute abdomen, intraperitoneal hemorrhage, or shock in the emergency practice."

In this database review we analyzed data from Planned Parenthood affiliates that provided medical abortion in 2009 and 2010 almost exclusively using an evidence-based buccal misoprostol regimen. We evaluated the incidence of six clinically significant adverse events (hospital admission, blood transfusion, emergency department treatment, intravenous antibiotics administration, infection, and death) and two significant outcomes (ongoing pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy diagnosed after medical abortion treatment was initiated). We calculated an overall rate as well as rates for each event and identified changes between the 2 years. Among 233,805 medical abortions provided in 2009 and 2010, significant adverse events or outcomes were reported in 1,530 cases (0.65%). There was no statistically significant difference in overall rates between years. The most common significant outcome was ongoing intrauterine pregnancy (0.50%); significant adverse events occurred in 0.16% of cases. One patient death occurred as a result of an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy. Only rates for emergency department treatment and blood transfusion differed by year and were slightly higher in 2010. Review of this large data set reinforces the safety of the evidence-based medical abortion regimen. III."

In the present, ultrasound technologies let us make early diagnosis raising the possibilities of a conservative treatment in several ways. Cervical ectopic pregnancy represent a big challenge for the obstetrician, requiring great diagnostic and therapeutic skills in order to preserve the reproductive capacity, specially because this kind of ectopic pregnancy is more frequent in assisted reproductive techniques like intrauterine insemination, and in couples seeking fertility treatments, the reproductive capacity is an extremely important issue. By now, there's no plenty scientific evidence about this problem to write diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. Today, personalized treatment is the only viable option for this patient. We report the case of a 31-year-old woman who arrived to our emergency room with a profuse vaginal bleeding, and with a history of conservative treatment for a cervical ectopic pregnancy."

Since reaching a diagnosis can be difficult, and delayed treatment of potentially dangerous diseases might have significant consequences, exploratory laparoscopy is a diagnostic and therapeutic option for patients who have unclear and potentially hazardous abdominal diseases. Here we describe a case where the anomaly could not be identified using a laparoscopy in an adolescent girl with acute abdomen. A 13-year old postmenarchal caucasian female presented with an acute abdomen. Emergency sonography could not exclude ovarian torsion. Accurate diagnosis and treatment were achieved only after an initial laparoscopy followed by a laparotomy and after a magnetic resonance imaging scan a further laparotomy. The underlying disease was hematometra of the right uterine horn in a uterus didelphys in conjunction with an imperforate right cervix. This report demonstrates that the usual approach for patients with acute abdominal pain may not be sufficient in emergency situations."

    "abstract": "To share our experience in ovary-sparing surgery for teratomas in children. The medical records of nine patients (mean age of 11.2 years, r 6-15 years) who had undergone ovary-sparing surgery for teratoma were analyzed retrospectively. Mean duration for follow-up was 29.5 months (r 15-75 months). Five patients suffered from chronic abdominal pain; two had acute colicky abdominal pain. In two patients, there was no presenting clinical symptom. Two patients were operated on emergency basis due to symptoms related with acute abdomen. On the other hand, seven were operated electively. Ultrasonography was performed in all patients. Additionally, MRI and tumor markers were performed in all but two. Main radiologic findings consisted of heterogenous cystic and solid ovarian masses predictive of teratoma. The definitive diagnosis in emergency cases were as follows: perforated appendicitis plus teratoma [1]; torsion of the ovarian mass with teratoma [1]. The final diagnosis in electively treated seven patients were: unilateral ovarian teratoma [4], bilateral ovarian teratoma [1], bilateral teratoma plus appendiceal inflammatory mass [1], unilateral teratoma and contralateral corpus hemorrhagicum cyst [1]. The operations were performed by open conventional surgery in six and laparoscopy in three patients. The procedures were ovary-sparing surgery in 12 ovaries, appendectomy in 2 patients and detorsion of ovary in 1 patient. The main indication for ovary-sparing surgery was the \"existence of a perfect dissection plane between the tumor margins and healthy ovarian tissue\". The remaining ovarian tissue was evaluated macroscopically for residual lesions. Frozen section was performed in three suspected patients and the ovarian margins were free of any tumor cell. The pathologic diagnosis was: mature cystic teratoma in 10, immature teratoma in 1 and corpus hemorrhagicum cyst in 1. The postoperative outcome and follow-up was uneventful. Heterogenous ovary mass containing solid and cystic portions with echogenic areas on ultrasound imaging is highly suggestive of ovarian teratomas. Emergent surgical intervention is indicated if there is any suspicion of ovarian torsion. Otherwise, MRI is performed for further radiological evaluation. Based on radiologic findings, ovary-sparing surgery can be safely performed if the preoperative diagnosis is teratoma and there is always a plane of dissection between the normal ovary and cyst wall."

Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) level (592 mUI/mL) and clinical and ultrasound (US) findings were suspicious for tubal pregnancy. On the third day, despite beta-hCG decrease (364 mUI/mL), she complained of severe pain in the lower abdomen, and physical examination revealed abdominal rebound tenderness. US showed a large amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Because of the unstable clinical condition, emergency laparoscopy and resection of left ovarian ectopic pregnancy were performed. Histology confirmed ovarian gestation. Conclusion. This case shows that ectopic pregnancy rupture may occur despite low levels of beta-hCG. Hemoperitoneum is not contraindication to laparoscopy."

We compared the management of torsion in both sexes to define a better clinical pathway for suspected OT. A 2.5-year review of the Pediatric Health Information System database was performed to determine the incidence of TT and OT at large children's hospitals. A 10-year retrospective review of children (0-19 years) diagnosed with TT or OT at a single academic center was performed to identify differences in diagnosis and management and determine the impact on gonadal salvage rates. The incidence of TT was comparable with OT in the Pediatric Health Information System database (0.03% vs 0.02%). A total of 158 patients with TT and 90 patients with OT were managed at our center with a median age of 12 years in both groups. Boys presented earlier after the onset of pain (36 vs 72 hours, P < .0001) and were imaged more quickly (0.77 vs 1.86 hours, P < .0001). Time to operating room (OR) was also shorter for TT (2.3 vs 6.3 hours, P < .0001). The salvage rate for TT was 30.3% vs 14.4% for OT (P < .01). Girls with suspected OT waited 2.5 times as long for diagnostic imaging and 2.7 times as long to be taken to the operating room. In addition, the gonadal salvage rate was significantly worse for girls compared with boys with TT. More urgent intervention for OT, with liberal use of diagnostic laparoscopy and without reliance on a definitive diagnosis by imaging, should be considered in girls with lower abdominal pain."

This review considers the safety and efficacy of three commonly used methods -- levonorgestrel (LNG-EC), ulipristal acetate (UPA) and the copper intrauterine device. All are extremely safe, and side effects are minimal. Concerns about increased risks of ectopic pregnancy after EC use have proved unfounded, and possible teratogenic effects seem unlikely. Although the true effectiveness of EC is impossible to estimate, recent research suggests that LNG-EC prevents around 50% of expected pregnancies in women using the method within 72 h of intercourse, whereas UPA appeared to prevent almost two thirds of pregnancies. Emergency intrauterine device insertion probably prevents over 95% of pregnancies. However, although improved accessibility of EC has clearly led to increased use, it does not appear to have had any public health benefit in reducing unintended pregnancy rates. Most of the data on sexual behavior following improved access to EC do not show any detrimental effect on subsequent use of other more effective methods of contraception or on the incidence of unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection. However, unless these other methods of contraception are also made easily available from pharmacies, improved access to EC risks unlinking its use with use of subsequent ongoing contraception."

Women often present at emergency departments in early pregnancy with a 'pregnancy of unknown location' (PUL) and diagnosis/exclusion of EP is challenging due to a lack of reliable biomarkers. Recent studies suggest that serum levels of a disintegrin and metalloprotease protein-12 (ADAM-12) can be used differentiate EP from viable intrauterine pregnancy (VIUP). Here we describe a prospective study evaluating the performance of ADAM-12 in differentiating EP from the full spectrum of alternative PUL outcomes in an independent patient cohort. Sera were collected from 120 patients at their first clinical presentation with a PUL and assayed for ADAM-12 by ELISA. Patients were categorized according to final pregnancy outcomes. Serum ADAM-12 concentrations were increased in women with histologically-confirmed EP (median 442 pg/mL; 25%-75% percentile 232-783 pg/mL) compared to women with VIUP (256 pg/mL; 168-442 pg/mL) or miscarriage (192 pg/mL; 133-476 pg/mL). Serum ADAM-12 did not differentiate histologically-confirmed EP from spontaneously resolving PUL (srPUL) (416 pg/mL; 154-608 pg/mL). The diagnostic potential of ADAM-12 was only significant when 'ambiguous' PUL outcomes were excluded from the analysis (AROC = 0.6633; P = 0.03901). When measured in isolation, ADAM-12 levels had limited value as a diagnostic biomarker for EP in our patient cohort. The development of a reliable serum biomarker-based test for EP remains an ongoing challenge."

Other causes or associations reported very infrequently include other endoscopy, pulmonary, cardiac or abdominal surgery, hysterectomy, peliosis, empyema, remote pancreato-renal transplant, thrombosed splenic vein, hemangiomata, pancreatic pseudocysts, splenic artery aneurysm, cholesterol embolism, splenic granuloma, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, rib exostosis, pancreatitis, Gaucher's disease, Wilson's disease, pheochromocytoma, afibrinogenemia and ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Emergency physicians should be attuned to the fact that rupture of the spleen can occur in the absence of major trauma or previously diagnosed splenic disease. The occurrence of such a rupture is likely to be the manifesting complaint of an underlying disease. Furthermore, colonoscopy should be more widely documented as a cause of splenic rupture."

    "abstract": "A 27-year-old woman with a positive urinary-pregnancy test, complaining of slight vaginal bleeding and some diffuse lower abdominal pain, presented to the emergency gynaecology unit at the Royal Free Hospital. Her initial ultrasound scan was inconclusive, and so serial serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) blood tests were carried out. These demonstrated a suboptimal increase. A second transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) was therefore performed, which showed a live cervical ectopic pregnancy. The patient, who remained haemodynamically stable, was admitted. She was treated with intramuscular methotrexate. She was given a second dose of methotrexate after 1&emsp14;week, since her beta hCG levels did not demonstrate a satisfactory fall. A rapid decrease in serum hCG was then observed and the patient was then discharged. An outpatient TVUS was normal. The patient remained well throughout her treatment, never suffered any profuse vaginal bleeding, and thus surgical intervention was avoided."

    "abstract": "Ovarian masses are the most frequent gynecological pathology seen in adolescent girls. Functional or organic tumors of the ovary are usually benign and the incidence rises with age. Most cysts are functional and adnexal torsion is the main complication, but a malignant etiology must nevertheless always be eliminated. The clinical presentation is quite variable. Ultrasonography is the investigation of choice: the sonogram will reveal a strictly fluid, benign functional cyst, suggest an adnexal torsion, and provide evidence of a heterogeneous mass. Emergency surgery is indicated only in the case of suspected ovarian torsion, in order to perform detorsion. In all other cases, serum tumor marker measurements will orient the diagnosis and MRI is an essential complement to imaging of tumors with heterogeneous solid components. Surgery and histopathological examination then determine the stage and the benign or malignant nature of the mass. Ovarian tumors are classified by the World Health Organization based on the cell of origin into epithelial tumors, germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors. Surgery should always follow oncological standards and be as conservative as possible to preserve future fertility."

    "abstract": "Visualization of follicles is perfectly physiological during childhood, their diameter generally does not exceed 10 mm. Ovarian cyst in childhood is well defined for a fluid image >20 mm. Generally mild and asymptomatic, ovarian cysts are fluid formations usually discovered incidentally by ultrasound. Some are hormonally active and cause the development of sexual characteristics. The natural history of functional cysts is eventual regression, and persistence is suggestive of organic tumor. The onset of pain is a sign of complication, and an abrupt sharp pain with vomiting is suggestive of ovarian torsion, in which case surgical intervention is urgent. In all cases, the diagnosis is based on pelvic ultrasound. MRI and tumor marker assays are required to determine the nature of an organic cyst before proceeding to surgery. These cysts may appear functional from the fetal period onward and will require management from the first days of life. Certain endocrine disorders such as precocious puberty, hypothyroidism, and aromatase deficiency cause functional cysts in girls. Recurrent bleeding is due to hormonally active cysts and suggests McCune-Albright syndrome. Although the persistence of a cyst suggests a neoplasm, a fluid character indicates benignity. Imagery is a useful aid in the diagnosis of epithelial tumors (cystadenomas) or teratoma (dermoid cyst)."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to discuss the surgical treatment for ovarian torsion in children and adolescents with a focus on the procedures of adnexal conservation surgery and its frequency in the literature of the last 10 years. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 127 operative ovarian lesions including 30 ovarian torsions (23.6%) treated in two pediatric centers over a 10-year period. Age at presentation, presenting symptoms, diagnostic studies, surgical procedure and pathological findings were analyzed. Mean age was 13.7 years. Conservative surgery has been performed in 46.7% of the cases and laparoscopic approach in 40%. Ovarian torsion occurred in 56.7% on ovaries with functional lesion, in 23.3% on normal adnexa and in 20% on ovaries with benign neoplasm. The article includes a literature review (2000-2010) and a statistical analysis which shows a slow increase in conservative surgery from 28 to 45%. Laparoscopic surgery accounts for 23.5%. Literature review shows 40.5% normal adnexa, 33.2% non-neoplastic lesions, 25.3% benign neoplasms and 1% malignant neoplasms. The surgical treatment of children and adolescents presenting adnexal torsion should be practiced as an emergency and it should be more conservative as possible in order to maximize the future reproductive potential."

Concerns about ectopic pregnancy, torsion of an enlarged ovary or malignancy usually dominate the diagnostic evaluation. On physical and imaging examination, when a palpable painful mass is present in the pelvis and the two ovaries and uterus are detected in their normal anatomical locations, the content and origin of the lesions may be significant in narrowing the pre-operative differential diagnosis. Thus, the emergent pelvic indications discussed in this review should be considered. The causes of acute abdominal pain are few in number and therefore an accurate diagnosis may be most frequently made at the time of exploratory laparotomy."

An understanding of ovarian physiology in the perimenarcheal and postpubertal patient supports ovarian preservation surgery, as the rate of malignancy is low and the alternative can be devastating. The most common ovarian cysts in adolescents are functional and often regress without further treatment. Symptomatic ovarian cysts warrant further investigation. Endometriomas arising from endometriosis are extremely uncommon. Tubo-ovarian abscesses are managed medically and rarely by drainage or surgery. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency, and prompt conservative operative management is indicated. Consideration of additional imaging, tumor markers, and surgical management of persistent or complex masses with ultrasound findings suspicious for malignancy is appropriate. This article reviews all these conditions and conservative management using laparoscopy as the preferred method if surgical intervention is needed. Unilateral removal of malignancies is advocated when possible."

The objective was to describe trends of these sequelae in Philadelphia after implementing citywide screening in a high-morbidity population (>6% positivity). In this ecologic study, which used data from 1996 to 2007, multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between the number of annual CT/GC screening tests by gender and the number of women aged 14-30 years hospitalized for PID or ectopic pregnancy. A standardized hospitalization database provided the number of admissions with a discharge diagnosis of PID or ectopic pregnancy. Positive CT/GC laboratory results reported by hospitals and emergency departments (EDs) were used as a proxy for outpatient PID. Between 1996 and 2007, CT/GC screening increased by 188%, whereas declines were noted in hospitalized PID cases (36%, -173 cases), ectopic pregnancy (38%, -119 cases), and ED-diagnosed CT/GC cases (39%, -727 cases). Screening 10,000 females for CT/GC corresponded with 26.1 fewer hospitalized PID cases (95% confidence interval 11.2-41.1), whereas screening 10,000 males corresponded to 10.4 (95% CI: 2.6-18.2) fewer cases. Although male screening was not significantly associated with ectopic pregnancy, screening 10,000 females was associated with 28.6 fewer ectopic pregnancies (95% CI: 7.4-49.8). This ecologic analysis found a correlation between large-scale CT/GC screening in a high-morbidity population and reductions in hospitalized PID, ectopic pregnancies, and ED-diagnosed CT/GC."

The presenting symptoms were found to be non-specific. The diagnosis in this population is twice more likely to be missed than in women with intact uteri. The rupture rate is 63%, compared with 37% in women with intact uteri. The majority of late post-hysterectomy ectopic pregnancies (62%) were located in the fallopian tubes. Because of the potential risk of mortality, emergency physicians should always consider the possibility of ectopic pregnancy in childbearing women whose surgical history includes hysterectomy without oophorectomy.

Classic indications include imaging for acute abdominal aneurysm, acute cholecystitis, hydronephrosis, and free intra-abdominal fluid in patients with trauma or suspected vascular or ectopic pregnancy rupture. Point-of-care sonographic imaging often emphasizes the diagnostic utility of fluid and edema, both as a significant finding and as a desirable adjunct for improved imaging. Conversely, the finding of sonographic intra-abdominal air is commonly 'tolerated' as a necessary evil that can foil image acquisition. This is in stark contrast to the accepted diagnostic utility of air in other imaging modalities for the acute abdomen, such as computed tomography and conventional radiography. Countering the bias against air as a deterrent for diagnostic ultrasound's accuracy are several published studies suggesting that abnormal air patterns can be used with high precision to diagnose pneumoperitoneum. These studies advocate that sonographic findings of abnormal air can be straightforward and can become crucial for increasing the diagnostic yield of bedside ultrasound of the acute abdomen. They suggest that practitioners should familiarize themselves with the findings and techniques to gain the experience required to make the diagnosis with confidence. This article will discuss four groups of abnormal air patterns found in the abdomen and the retroperitoneum and the respective scanning techniques, with a focus on the use of ultrasound for diagnosing pneumoperitoneum and a suggested scanning approach in the emergency setting."

A retrospective case note review of all medically treated ectopic pregnancies over a 10-year period in a tertiary referral hospital in the southwest of England. 398 women were identified in total. Three were excluded and five case notes could not be located. A βhCG ≤ 3000 iu/l occurred in 73.8%. Mean follow-up duration was 25.9 days when the βhCG was ≤ 3000 iu/l compared to 42.3 days when it was >3000 iu/l. When βhCG was ≤ 3000 iu/l, a repeat dose of Methotrexate and emergency surgery were required in 10.4 and 4.5% cases, respectively, compared to 21.6 and 14.7% when βhCG >3000 iu/l. All differences were statistically significant. By fitting logistic regression models to our data, a reference table indicating the risk of requiring a repeat dose of Methotrexate or subsequent surgery for any βhCG level has been created. Although follow-up duration and the need for repeat doses of Methotrexate and/or surgical intervention increases with increasing serum βhCG, medical management is still safe and effective when the βhCG is >3000 iu/l and should be promoted."

Management of the bladder injuries varied from a urinary catheter alone to laparotomy with debridement of the abdominal wall due to sepsis and later reconstruction. Four of the six cases were performed by registrars. Although the incidence of bladder injury is low, its importance is highlighted by the large number of laparoscopies being performed.

Pregnancy-associated circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of pregnancy-associated complications. This proof-of-concept study examined the diagnostic accuracy of various miRNAs to detect EP in an emergency department (ED) setting. This study was a retrospective case-control analysis of 89 women who presented to the ED with vaginal bleeding and/or abdominal pain/cramping and received a diagnosis of viable intrauterine pregnancy (VIP), spontaneous abortion (SA), or EP. Serum hCG and progesterone concentrations were measured by immunoassays. The serum concentrations of miRNAs miR-323-3p, miR-517a, miR-519d, and miR-525-3p were measured with TaqMan real-time PCR. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the clinical utility of these biomarkers, both as single markers and as multimarker panels for EP. Concentrations of serum hCG, progesterone, miR-517a, miR-519d, and miR-525-3p were significantly lower in EP and SA cases than in VIP cases (P < 0.01). In contrast, the concentration of miR-323-3p was significantly increased in EP cases, compared with SA and VIP cases (P < 0.01). As a single marker, miR-323-3p had the highest sensitivity of 37.0% (at a fixed specificity of 90%). In comparison, the combined panel of hCG, progesterone, and miR-323-3p yielded the highest sensitivity (77.8%, at a fixed specificity of 90%). A stepwise analysis that used hCG first, added progesterone, and then added miR-323-3p yielded a 96.3% sensitivity and a 72.6% specificity. Pregnancy-associated miRNAs, especially miR-323-3p, added substantial diagnostic accuracy to a panel including hCG and progesterone for the diagnosis of EP."

C. trachomatis is the etiologic agent of several common genital tract syndromes such as urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. In this review, the pathophysiology of a chlamydial infection as well as diagnosis, therapy and prevention strategies regarding female chlamydial infection are reviewed. A chlamydial infection results in minimal or even no symptoms in approximately two-thirds of women, remaining therefore clinically apparent and undiagnosed. C. trachomatis infections are of great socioeconomic and public health concern due to the potential for severe long-term consequences in women, including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, tubal infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Moreover, if the bacterium is transmitted during labor to a newborn, it can cause ophthalmia neonatorum and atypical neonatal pneumonia. Due to the documented increased risk of morbidity, several national guidelines are available, including a routine screening for young women and screening during pregnancy that is recommended in several countries. A routine screening for young women and screening during pregnancy is recommended in several countries. However, additional prospective studies of the effectiveness of chlamydia screening are warranted and might be feasible within established screening programs. Moreover, the transition from cervicitis to infertility should be also evaluated in future controlled studies to underline the existing evidence. Additionally, there is an urgent need to educate and inform health-care providers about implementation of screening programs to reduce the spread of chlamydial infection. Moreover, awareness and use of screening programs by the public is needed, which requires informational campaigns for the general public using different media. For improved screening strategies and public awareness, novel approaches have to be developed and evaluated. Finally, guidelines should be actively disseminated to all medical practitioners to increase their use in daily practice. Although the major socioeconomic and public health concerns of C. trachomatis infection are recognized, several considerations and additional measures for addressing this increasingly urgent health problem remain."

Right-side adnexal torsion occurred in 14 patients, and left-side torsion in seven patients. Ovarian cysts, most often dermoid cysts (e.g., teratomas), were found in 16 patients (76%). Except for one conservatively treated case and one malignant case (adult granulose cell tumor), the other results of the pathological examination were as follows: eight dermoid cysts, two cystadenomas, one follicular cyst, and eight simple cysts. Although it is uncommon, adnexal torsion should be included in the differential diagnosis of lower abdominal pain in all girls, regardless of age. Sonography is helpful for making such a diagnosis. Time is a critical factor, and early laparoscopy or laparotomy may save a viable ovary."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) is an important cause of abdominal pain in girls. Prompt recognition of OT may lead to higher rates of ovarian salvage. To identify clinical and laboratory findings that may indicate OT among girls with abdominal pain. Retrospective review of two cohorts of girls aged 5-17 years admitted to a children's hospital. Cohort 1: Girls admitted with abdominal pain from the emergency department (2008). Cohort 2: Girls with a discharge diagnosis of OT (2003-9). Cohort 1: 325 girls were admitted from the emergency department with abdominal pain during 2008. Of these, 9 (3%) were diagnosed with OT. Cohort 2: 37 girls were diagnosed with OT during 2003-9. Clinical or laboratory features differentiating OT from all abdominal pain could not be identified. A comparison of girls admitted with confirmed appendicitis showed that OT was more likely to be associated with a mass (RR=4.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 17), and less likely to be associated with anorexia (RR=0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.93), guarding (RR=0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85), an elevated C reactive protein (RR=0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.83), or leucocytosis (RR=0.4, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78). Findings were similar in girls with an admission diagnosis of 'possible appendicitis'. Clinical or laboratory features that would identify cases of OT among girls admitted with abdominal pain could not be identified. Some findings help to differentiate OT from appendicitis, but there is a large degree of overlap. OT is an uncommon condition, but has important management implications, and should be considered in all girls presenting with abdominal pain."

To present a rare case of a young woman with shock after voluntary termination of pregnancy due to undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy with concealed hemorrhage. A 37-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department (ED) 3 days after termination of pregnancy with clinical features of shock. The patient had some evidence of infection and was initially managed as a case of septic shock secondary to possible complication of recent termination of pregnancy. Subsequent work-up led to suspicion of internal bleeding, and ruptured ectopic pregnancy was confirmed and managed successfully. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy can present with a wide range of symptoms and under variable circumstances. Recognition of subtle signs of hemorrhage and consideration of the diagnosis of ruptured pregnancy in the ED will lead to early diagnosis and appropriate management."

Following tubal ligation, a woman with amenorrhea and elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) concentrations may be experiencing either an ectopic or an intrauterine pregnancy. Other sources of HCG production can include ovarian germ cell tumors or gestational trophoblastic disease such as a complete or partial molar pregnancy. A rare source of HCG production is a benign mature ovarian teratoma. A 31-year old Gravida 2 para 2 presented with a positive home pregnancy test three years after she had experienced a Pomeroy tubal ligation. Her serum HCG was 57,914 mlU/mL but a transvaginal ultrasound did not find an intrauterine pregnancy. Laparoscopy was performed due to a suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy and an 11-cm benign mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst) within the right ovary was removed. An ectopic pregnancy was not visualized. Post-operatively, her serum HCG levels decreased and were negative within four weeks. Mature ovarian cystic teratomas have rarely been reported to secrete HCG. They can be an infrequent source of HCG production and may lead to emergency surgery to treat a suspected extra-uterine pregnancy."

A 24 year-old primigravida presented to our clinic at the 36(th) week of a twin pregnancy with labour pain and cervical dilatation. On ultrasound examination, 2 masses of 90×60 and 60×70 mm were seen in the right and left adnexal regions respectively. Her history showed that she had unexplained infertility for 4 years and had undergone IVF with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-agonist stimulation. Two embryos were transferred. Twin pregnancy was detected on ultrasound examination. The patient was delivered by emergency caesarean section due to transverse presentations at 36(th) weeks of gestation. During the operation, both adnexae were markedly enlarged, the right ovary measuring about 15×18 cm and the left about 16×18 cm. There was minimal ascites in the abdominal cavity. Ovarian biopsy was performed and the final pathology report showed bilateral follicle cysts. The patient was discharged on the postoperative 4(th) day. The patient was seen 4 weeks later. She had no complaints and ultrasound follow-up revealed a normal size uterus and ovaries. We should keep in mind that hyperstimulated, enlarged ovaries and its complication may be seen in the late weeks of pregnancy, even at term, in cases of in vitro fertilization cases. Therefore, close follow-up of pregnant IVF patints is recommended whether they had OHSS or not, because ovarian torsion caused by hyperstimulated ovaries may be difficult to diagnose during pregnancy.

A 49-year-old woman with a history of an ectopic pregnancy, lost to follow-up in spite of rising human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, presented three years later at the emergency ward with hemoptysis, vaginal bleeding and elevated serum hCG. Pulmonary and vaginal metastasis was found, and the diagnosis of a choriocarcinoma was confirmed. She received chemotherapy during a 6-month period and recovered successfully. Seven years later she is free of disease. Reevaluation of the histological specimen from the previous ectopic pregnancy confirmed an ovarian hydatidiform mole and the later development of choriocarcinoma which probably originated from this mole. The diagnosis of hydatidiform mole can be difficult, however, it may be crucial to the patient. Whenever a histopathologic examination of products of conception is performed, it is important that a hydatidiform mole can be ruled out, and that may require additional analysis such as immunohistochemistry and DNA ploidy. In cases in which a gestational trophoblastic disease is suspected, it is necessary to monitor serum hCG until values are negative."

Minimal fluid intake, resulting in decreased urine production and a high concentration of stone-forming salts, is a leading factor in renal calculi development. Radio-opaque calcareous stones account for 70% to 75% of renal calculi. Microscopic hematuria in the presence of acute flank pain is suggestive of renal colic, but the absence of red blood cells does not exclude urolithiasis. Furthermore, many inflammatory and infectious conditions cause hematuria, demonstrating the low specificity of urinalysis testing. The diagnostic modality of choice is a noncontrast computed tomography (CT); ultrasonography s preferred in pregnant patients and children. Combining opioids with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is the optimal evidence-based regimen to treat severe symptoms. Rapid intravenous (IV) hydration has not shown a benefit. Potentially life-threatening diagnoses including abdominal aortic aneurysm, ovarian torsion, and appendicitis may mimic renal colic and must be ruled out."

An observational study was carried out within the gynaecological emergency service from 01/06/2000 to 15/05/2010. Patients had pregnancy failure in the first 12 weeks at ultrasonic examination. The patient received 4 misoprostol tablets (800 μg) intravaginally with clinical and ultrasound examination 24 hours later. The treatment was considered effective if the endometrial thickness was lower than 15 mm by ultrasound examination and absence of secondary endo-uterine aspiration. If the treatment was considered as a failure, an endo-uterine aspiration was carried out. Variables studied were clinical (patient age, date of the last menstrual period, gravidity, parity, history of miscarriage, endouterine aspiration, ectopic pregnancy, vaginal delivery, caesarean section) and ultrasound-based (presence or absence of an embryo, CRL, gestational sac diameter). Five hundred and one patients were included. The success rate was 336/501 (67.1%). After univariate analysis, the averages of parity (P=0.048) and caesarean section (P=0.002) were significantly higher in failure cases. The history of one or more caesarean section was a significant risk factor for failure (P=0.001). There was no significant difference for the other criteria. In multivariate analysis, the average number of caesarean sections (P=0.003) and the history of one or more caesarean section remained significant (P=0.002). The ultrasound criteria and gestational age do not impact the effectiveness of misoprostol in the treatment of early pregnancy failure. The history of one or more caesarean section (s) significantly decreased the success rate. It has to be confirmed by other studies. This new data can be an aid to decision-making for the patient and the physician in case of early pregnancy failure."

Data regarding post-coital oral and peri-coital vaginal application of LNG were extracted from the literature through MEDLINE database service for years 2001-2010. It was found that a single dose of 1.5 mg LNG or two doses of 0.75 mg LNG 12 h apart were used for EC. Currently, LNG is also on trial for vaginal application as EC in Carraguard gel for 'dual protection'. The oral or vaginal dose of 1.5 mg LNG resulted in peak plasma concentration, C(max) 19.2 or 3.21 ng/ml, with shorter time, T(max) 1.4 or 6.6 h, and greater AUC, 152.7 or 52.5 ng.h/ml, with shorter half-life, 25 or 32 h, respectively. LNG EC inhibited mid-cycle LH surge and delayed or prevented ovulation when administered before ovulation. Mechanism of action of LNG EC appeared to inhibit or delay ovulation. The risk of pregnancy was 4.12%. A single dose of 1.5 mg LNG could reduce the pregnancy rate to 0.7%. Occurrence of ectopic pregnancy following failure of LNG EC was reported. This EC caused no serious adverse effects but was associated with menstrual disturbance. Although widely acceptable, the cost and short-supply to rural areas pose a barrier to access EC for the poor and rural-dwellers, respectively. It was concluded that unlike post-coital oral administration, peri-coital vaginal application of 1.5 mg LNG needs further study to be an alternative option for women to use it for prevention of pregnancy."

Preoperative determination of the ovarian necrosis extent is difficult but it may increase the likelihood of the ovary conservation. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the findings in ovarian torsion among patients with ovarian tumors who underwent emergency surgery at a single hospital for possible preoperative indicators of ovarian viability. We thus evaluated 77 patients who were intraoperatively diagnosed with torsion of ovarian tumor between 1995 and 2010. These patients were classified into three groups depending on the postoperative histopathological findings: necrotic, congestive, and normal. Preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) level, leukocyte count, and body temperature, along with tumor size, degree of torsion, time from the onset of abdominal pain to surgery, and incidence of acute abdomen were compared among the three groups. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the preoperative serum CRP levels for ovarian necrosis were calculated. The CRP level, degree of torsion, and time from the onset of abdominal pain to surgery were significantly higher in the necrotic group than in the normal group. The sensitivity and specificity of the CRP level for necrosis were 35% and 83%, respectively, and positive and negative predictive values were 38% and 82% respectively. The potential for ovary conservation in suspected ovarian torsion should be greater if the tumor is non-malignant, the time from the onset of abdominal pain to operation is short, and the CRP level is < 0.3 mg/dl."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) occurs when the embryo fails to transit to the uterus and attach to the luminal epithelium of the Fallopian tube (FT). Tubal EP is a common gynecological emergency and more than 95% of EP occurs in the ampullary region of the FT. In humans, Wnt activation and downregulation of olfactomedin-1 (Olfm-1) occur in the receptive endometrium and coincided with embryo implantation in vivo. Whether similar molecular changes happen in the FT leading to EP remains unclear. We hypothesized that activation of Wnt signaling downregulates Olfm-1 expression predisposes to EP. We investigated the spatiotemporal expression of Olfm-1 in FT from non-pregnant women and women with EP, and used a novel trophoblastic spheroid (embryo surrogate)-FT epithelial cell co-culture model (JAr and OE-E6/E7 cells) to study the role of Olfm-1 on spheroid attachment. Olfm-1 mRNA expression in the ampullary region of non-pregnant FT was higher (P<0.05) in the follicular phase than in the luteal phase. Ampullary tubal Olfm-1 expression was lower in FT from women with EP compared to normal controls at the luteal phase (histological scoring (H-SCORE)=1.3±0.2 vs 2.4±0.5; P<0.05). Treatment of OE-E6/E7 with recombinant Olfm-1 (0.2-5 μg/ml) suppressed spheroid attachment to OE-E6/E7 cells, while activation of Wnt-signaling pathway by Wnt3a or LiCl reduced endogenous Olfm-1 expression and increased spheroid attachment. Conversely, suppression of Olfm-1 expression by RNAi increased spheroid attachment to OE-E6/E7 cells. Taken together, Wnt activation suppresses Olfm-1 expression, and this may predispose a favorable microenvironment of the retained embryo in the FT, leading to EP in humans."

    "abstract": "Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (ACS) is characterized by intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), elevation and splinting of the diaphragm, high pleural pressure, and poor venous return to the heart, producing low cardiac output and shock which, in turn, results in poor venous return across the capillaries to set in a vicious cycle. Unless the Intra-abdominal pressure is reduced quickly by urgent surgical or medical interventions, death is inevitable. We report a case of ACS resulting from an unrecognized slow but massive intra-abdominal bleeding caused by a ruptured ectopic pregnancy (REP) in an Arab woman. Due to the unusual nature of the presentation of the REP, the diagnosis proved elusive for over a week until the patient succumbed to hypovolemic shock after losing about 4.2 l inside the peritoneal space. The fruitless effort at aggressive fluid resuscitation was at operation found not due to hypovolemia per se but due to IAH causing ACS. The lessons learned from this case emphasize the need for awareness about atypical presentations of REP and the need for quick intervention to terminate the vicious cycle of ACS."

    "abstract": "Emergency departments (ED) frequently evaluate patients with probable ectopic pregnancies who go home and may rupture. It would be beneficial to know which patient factors are associated with rupture and which are not. The purpose of this study was to determine which ED patients with ectopic pregnancies are at risk for rupture. This study was a retrospective chart review of all women aged ≥18 years during a 5-year period who were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy to a level I ED. Data collected included basic demographic information, medical, surgical, obstetric and gynecologic history, social and sexual history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory values such as urine pregnancy test, β-hCG, and complete blood count. There was a significant difference using a multivariate regression analysis with 95% CI in history findings of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and urinary tract symptoms. There was a significant difference in physical examination of pulse, diastolic pressure, abdominal tenderness, peritoneal signs, cervical motion tenderness, and adnexal tenderness. There was also a significant difference in β-hCG, hemoglobin and hematocrit results and ultrasound findings of free peritoneal fluid, intrauterine pregnancy and cardiac findings between those who ruptured and those who did not. None of these tests was able to differentiate those that would go on to rupture. The result of the study did not find any single sign, symptom, or test that could reliably differentiate patients who have a ruptured ectopic from those who do not. However, β-hCG over 1500 mIU was the best variable in explaining the variation between those who would or would not go on to rupture after their ED visit."

    "abstract": "In Maryland, an analysis from 1994-1999 found that most hospitalized patients with tubal pregnancy underwent extirpative operations. The objective of this study was to determine whether practice patterns had changed over time. Using the Maryland Health Service Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) database from January 1, 2000-December 31, 2004, subjects were identified by ICD-9 code 633.1, tubal pregnancy. The incidence of hospitalization was estimated based on state census data. Cases were analyzed by demographics, presentation, surgeon volume for ectopics, surgical treatment, length of stay, and charges. There were 2292 cases of tubal pregnancy identified, yielding an incidence for hospitalization of 4.81 per 10,000 women. The mean age of subjects was 29.6. Most were admitted through the emergency department (76.8%). Extirpative procedures were used in 88.01%. ER admission and increasing age were associated with extirpative surgery. Mean length of stay was 1.86 days; mean total charges were $5480.11. A greater percentage of hospitalized ectopics were treated radically than prior. This may be due to acuity of presentation or regional surgical practices and preferences. Continued surveillance and a move toward improvement of Maryland's outcomes for ectopic pregnancy is needed. We propose an algorithm for emergency triage and management of pregnancy in an unknown location toward this end."

    "abstract": "Lower abdominal pain is a common complaint in girls and young women presenting to a pediatric emergency department (PED). An extensive evaluation may be required to exclude surgical emergencies such as appendicitis and ovarian torsion. However, clinicians and families prefer to limit invasive procedures and radiation exposure. The literature suggests that serum biomarkers such as the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) can predict ovarian torsion in adults, while the membrane glycoprotein cluster of differentiation-64 (CD64) has been linked with bacterial infections and sepsis. Therefore, the study objective was to assess whether plasma IL-6 or neutrophil CD64 surface levels would assist clinicians in distinguishing surgical diagnoses (ovarian torsion and appendicitis) from nonsurgical diagnoses in young females with lower abdominal pain. This study was a prospective, cross-sectional, pilot study of young females presenting with lower abdominal pain. Demographics, clinical and laboratory data, and final diagnoses were recorded. Plasma IL-6 and neutrophil CD64 were quantified. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to detect significant differences in IL-6 and CD64 values between surgical and nonsurgical patients. Further analysis was done to detect differences among the surgical patients (appendicitis vs. ovarian torsion). A bivariate analysis using the Wilcoxon rank sum was used to test for significant differences in IL-6 and CD64 by selected clinical factors. There were 112 female subjects ages 6 to 21 years enrolled. Final diagnoses were grouped as appendicitis (n = 38, 34%), ovarian torsion (n = 15, 13%), and nonsurgical (n = 59, 53%). Surgical cases had significantly higher levels of IL-6 compared to nonsurgical cases (p < 0.0001), and appendicitis patients had significantly higher CD64 indexes compared to ovarian torsion patients (p = 0.007). The clinical characteristics of fever of ≥38°C (p = 0.0002) and constant pain (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with elevated IL-6. Fever of ≥38°C (p = 0.02) was significantly associated with a higher CD64 index. Interleukin-6 was significantly elevated in surgical patients compared to nonsurgical patients in this sample of young females, and CD64 was significantly elevated in appendicitis patients compared to ovarian torsion patients. These data suggest that with larger sample sizes and future confirmatory studies, these biomarkers may be useful in the evaluation of young women with lower quadrant abdominal pain."

Eight patients presented to the emergency department, of which 6 (75%) were initially misdiagnosed. The most common misdiagnosis was threatened miscarriage (n = 5). All patients with accurately diagnosed CEP presented with heavy vaginal bleeding; those misdiagnosed reported mild to moderate vaginal bleeding. Three of six patients misdiagnosed did not have an ultrasound performed upon presentation, and three patients had an ultrasound report not suggestive of CEP. CEP was diagnosed on follow-up ultrasound, delaying treatment 1-4 days. Misdiagnosis of CEP upon initial presentation is a common occurrence.

These women have many concerns, one of which is the viability of their pregnancy and the probability of miscarriage. We sought to determine fetal outcomes of women with an indeterminate ultrasound who present to the ED during the first trimester of pregnancy. A retrospective analysis of consecutive ED patient encounters from December 2005 to September 2006 was performed to identify patients who were pregnant and who had an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound performed by an emergency physician or through the Radiology Department during their ED visit. Demographic data, obstetric/gynecologic history, and presenting symptoms were recorded onto a standardized patient chart template designed to be used for any first trimester pregnancy. Outcomes (spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and 20-week gestation) were determined via computerized medical records. During the study timeframe, a total of 1164 patients were evaluated in the ED during the first trimester of their pregnancy; 359 patients (30.8%) met inclusion criteria and had a diagnosis of indeterminate ultrasound. Outcome data were obtained for 293 patients. Carrying the pregnancy to ≥20 weeks occurred in 70 patients (23.9%). Spontaneous abortion occurred in 193 women (65.9%), and 30 women (10.2%) were treated for an ectopic pregnancy. Total fetal loss incidence was 89.2% in patients presenting with any vaginal bleeding, compared to 34.7% in patients with pain only. Indeterminate ultrasounds in the setting of first trimester symptomatic pregnancy are indicative of poor fetal outcomes. Vaginal bleeding increased the risk of fetal loss. These data will assist emergency physicians in counseling women in the ED who are found to have an indeterminate ultrasound."

The patient conceived after transfer of three frozen-thawed embryos at a fertility clinic where she had previously undergone laparoscopic left salpingectomy due to pyosalpinx. Approximately 4 weeks after the embryo transfer, she presented with a complaint of abnormal genital bleeding and was diagnosed by ultrasound as having a dichorionic twin pregnancy. One week later, she was referred to our hospital because of lower abdominal pain. Hematoperitoneum was suspected based on findings of low blood pressure and tachycardia. Diagnostic emergent laparoscopy demonstrated an ectopic pregnancy in the remnant isthmic portion of the left tube. Laparoscopic excision of the remnant fallopian tube was performed, but the procedure resulted in early-pregnancy loss of one of the twins. The risk of heterotopic pregnancy is not small under assisted reproductive technology. Attention should be paid to the risk of tubal pregnancy after transferring more than two embryos or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, even after salpingectomy has been performed."

Hematocolpos linked to imperforate hymen is the most common obstructive congenital abnormality of the female genital tract and the diagnosis is easy with inspection of external genitalia. Ovarian tumors are infrequent and most often begnin but torsion, rupture or bleeding complications causes acute abdominal pains.

To evaluate the association between the time of day of patient presentation and the use of diagnostic ultrasound services in United States (U.S.) EDs. This was a cross-sectional study of ED patient visits using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for the years 2003 to 2005. Our main outcome measure was the use of diagnostic ultrasound during the ED patient visit as abstracted from the medical record. We performed multivariate analyses to identify any association between ultrasound use and time of presentation for all patients, as well as for two subgroups who are more likely to need ultrasound as part of their routine workup: patients at risk of deep venous thrombosis, and patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy. During the three-year period, we analyzed 110,447 patient encounters, representing 39 million national visits. Of all ED visits, 2.6% received diagnostic ultrasound. Presenting to the ED \"off hours\" (defined as Monday through Friday 7pm to 7am and weekends) was associated with a lower rate of ultrasound use independent of potential confounders (odds ratio [OR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 - 0.82). Patients at increased risk of deep venous thrombosis who presented to the ED during \"off hours\" were also less likely to undergo diagnostic ultrasound (OR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15 - 0.79). Similarly, patients at increased risk of ectopic pregnancy received fewer diagnostic ultrasounds during \"off hours\" (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35 - 0.91). In U.S. EDs, ultrasound use was lower during \"off hours,\" even among patient populations where its use would be strongly indicated."

Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate relevant characteristics, and adjusted odds ratios were used to highlight the predictors of key service delivery outcomes. Women who presented to the ED for a problem in early pregnancy accounted for 1.2% of all ED presentations for women. The average age of women who presented to the ED for a problem in early pregnancy was 29.3 years, with 25% aged 35 years or older. Over a fourth (28%) of women presented to the ED on a weekend and over a third (37%) presented after-hours.

    "abstract": "Conscientious commitment, the reverse of conscientious objection, inspires healthcare providers to overcome barriers to delivery of reproductive services to protect and advance women's health. History shows social reformers experiencing religious condemnation and imprisonment for promoting means of birth control, until access became popularly accepted. Voluntary sterilization generally followed this pattern to acceptance, but overcoming resistance to voluntary abortion calls for courage and remains challenging. The challenge is aggravated by religious doctrines that view treatment of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and emergency contraception not by reference to women's healthcare needs, but through the lens of abortion. However, modern legal systems increasingly reject this myopic approach. Providers' conscientious commitment is to deliver treatments directed to women's healthcare needs, giving priority to patient care over adherence to conservative religious doctrines or religious self-interest. The development of in vitro fertilization to address childlessness further illustrates the inspiration of conscientious commitment over conservative objections."

Acute ovarian torsion without appropriate treatment may result in loss of ovarian function, tissue necrosis, and death. The objective of this article is to present a case of pediatric ovarian torsion and describe the difficulty of distinguishing it from perforated appendicitis in the emergency department (ED). We report a 5-year-old girl who presented to the ED with nausea, tenderness over the right lower guardant of her abdomen, fever, and anorexia. She was initially diagnosed with appendicitis based on physical examination and abdominal computed tomography scan and was sent to the operating room for surgical exploration. The definite diagnosis of the patient was acute ovarian torsion complicated with cystic teratoma. Primary clinicians in the ED should pay more attention to acute ovarian torsion in young children because it is difficult to diagnose in time to salvage the gynecological function when the clinical presentations masquerade as perforated appendicitis."

A transvaginal ultrasound assessment revealed a complex mass containing a gestational sac with vitelline vesicle behind the left ovary. At laparoscopy, a nodular lesion was seen next to the left uterosacral ligament, suggesting the presence of an ectopic pregnancy in the retroperitoneal space. The unusual location of an ectopic pregnancy such as in the retroperitoneum should be examined in patients with clinical findings that suggest ectopic pregnancy if both the uterus and adnexa are normal during laparoscopic exploration. The patient's retroperitoneal pregnancy was treated with a wide laparoscopic excision. To allow the removal of all trophoblastic tissue, a 3×2×2 cm hemorrhagic mass containing the ectopic pregnancy was removed from the retroperitoneal space. Retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy was confirmed by the pathology diagnosis. Retroperitoneal pregnancy after assisted reproductive techniques is an exceptional condition that must be considered in patients with clinical findings that suggest ectopic pregnancy if both the uterus and adnexa are normal during laparoscopic exploration."

We retrospectively studied all children treated for OT at a pediatric teaching hospital in Paris, France, between March 1992 and July 2006. OSS was performed when deemed technically feasible in patients who had no lymphadenopathy by preoperative imaging or surgical exploration, normal tumor marker levels, and calcifications on radiographs. We identified 30 patients, including 29 with unilateral OT and 1 with synchronous bilateral OT. Emergent surgery was performed in five patients, among whom four had ovarian torsion requiring oophorectomy and one underwent OSS. Of the 26 OTs in the 25 remaining patients, 10 were managed with OSS and 16 with oophorectomy. Subsequently, ultrasound monitoring detected OT development in the contralateral ovary in 4 (14%) patients, after a median of 3 years (range, 1-14 years); OSS was performed in all four cases. The patient with bilateral synchronous OT, managed by OSS initially, underwent unilateral oophorectomy 3 years later for a recurrence. Overall OSS was performed for 15 (42%) OTs. Our results suggest recommendations for preserving fertility whenever possible without compromising the oncological prognosis. In particular, OSS should be reserved for patients who meet all criteria for localized mature teratoma. Long-term follow-up is crucial."

Some authors have speculated that sudden acceleration/deceleration movements may precipitate torsion. The objective of this report is to describe a case of intermittent abdominal pain lasting nearly 6 months, which started when the child began playing regularly on a trampoline, and was ultimately diagnosed as intermittent ovarian torsion of an otherwise normal ovary. A 12-year-old girl presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with 2 h of abdominal pain and vomiting. She reported similar episodes over the previous 6 months. Initial ultrasound, obtained between episodes, was normal. Repeat ultrasound at ED presentation showed no blood flow to the left adnexa. Surgery confirmed the ovary to be twisted 1080 degrees and markedly edematous due to vascular engorgement. The family retrospectively identified the onset of the first episode as happening the same week the child had begun playing regularly on a trampoline. After surgery, she no longer played on the trampoline. At follow-up 22 months later, she had had no recurrence of her symptoms. Intermittent ovarian torsion should be considered as a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain in children. The presence of blood flow with Doppler ultrasound during acute symptoms does not exclude the diagnosis. Clinicians might also ask about unusual physical activities because several authors have theorized that ovarian torsion could be precipitated by sudden acceleration/deceleration movements."

Patients received pelvic ultrasonography, serum β-hCG testing, and blinded formal radiologic ultrasonography. All patients were followed for 8 weeks to determine outcomes. The sensitivity and specificity of a discriminatory β-hCG level of 3,000 mIU/mL for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy were calculated for patients without an intrauterine pregnancy visualized by bedside ultrasonography. Thirty-six faculty physicians performed bedside pelvic ultrasonography on 256 patients. There were 161 cases with a confirmed visualizable intrauterine pregnancy and 29 ectopic pregnancies. Bedside ultrasonography identified 115 intrauterine pregnancies. The range of β-hCG for cases of confirmed visualizable intrauterine pregnancy with a nondiagnostic bedside ultrasonography was 15 mIU/mL to 123,368 mIU/mL (median 6,633; interquartile range 1,551 to 32,699). For patients with nondiagnostic bedside ultrasonography, using a discriminatory β-hCG level of 3,000 mIU/mL to further assess for ectopic pregnancy showed sensitivity of 35% (95% confidence interval [CI] 18% to 54%) and specificity of 58% (95% CI 48% to 67%).

The possible role of 1.5-mg LNG EE in causing ectopic pregnancy is discussed. A high serum LNG concentration decreases ciliary activity and tube motility, but further epidemiological studies are necessary to establish the risk of ectopic pregnancy following intake of LNG EE."

Case-control study. Three urban academic centers. Women who were seen in the emergency department with pain or bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy. Sera from women with diagnosed EP or IUP were evaluated via proteomics and an ADAM-12 dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluoroimmunoassay. Differences between groups, area under the receiver operating curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Via a proteomics evaluation, we found a statistically significant decrease in ADAM-12 in the sera of patients with EP, which we confirmed in a larger group of 199 patients (median IUP 18.6 ng/mL versus median EP 2.5 ng/mL with good discrimination between the groups as assessed by receiver operating characteristics [area under the curve = 0.82]). At a low cut-point, the sensitivity was 70% and specificity 84%, but, at a higher cut-point optimizing sensitivity, the ADAM-12 test demonstrated a sensitivity of 97%. ADAM-12 is a promising marker for the diagnosis of EP in women with symptoms in the first trimester, validating the proteomics findings. Further studies in additional patient populations and in combination with other biomarkers are needed."

Ultrasound diagnosis in the emergency department was compared with an ultimate clinical diagnosis in women in need of a gynecologic consult. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and accuracy of the initial ultrasound impression were calculated and stratified by criteria of diagnosis, serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, pain, and bleeding. Eighteen hundred eighty women were evaluated. Overall accuracy of initial ultrasound diagnosis was 78%. A probable ultrasound diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (adnexal mass without the presence of a yolk sac or embryo) resulted in a higher sensitivity (42.1% compared with 13.2%: P<.001) but a lower positive predictive value (82.7% compared with 98%: P<.01) compared with a definite diagnosis. A probable ultrasound diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy (double decidual sign without yolk sac or embryo) resulted in a higher sensitivity (36.0% compared with 4.0%; P<.001) and lower positive predictive value (58.8% compared with 87.0%; P>.001) compared with a definite diagnosis. The sensitivity (34.3% compared with 75.9%; P<.01) and positive predictive value (80.4% compared with 91.5%; P=.02) were lower for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy when serum hCG level was less than 2,000 milli-international units/mL. Ultrasonography was less accurate when bleeding was the chief complaint (72.7% compared with 84.8% P<.006) but not substantially altered by pain as a chief complaint (78.0 compared with 77.8% P>.99). A substantial number of misdiagnoses can occur when initial ultrasound diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy is made without evidence of a yolk sac or embryo, when hCG values are low, or when a patient has significant bleeding.

    "abstract": "Torsion of the ovary is a rare but serious cause of gynecologic surgical emergency. Specific laboratory markers that support the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian torsion are not currently available in the clinical routine. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of plasma D-dimer level as an early indicator of ovarian torsion in an experimental rat ovarian torsion model. Sixteen female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used for this controlled experimental study. Eight rats in the sham operation group (Group I) underwent a surgical procedure similar to Group II but the ovary was not occluded. In Group II (eight rats), a torsion model was created by using atraumatic vascular clips just above and below the right ovary for a 2-h period of ischemia. Right ovaries were surgically removed at the end of the procedure in each group. Blood was sampled before and after operation to assess plasma D-dimer levels. The main outcome measure was ovarian histopathologic findings scores and plasma D-dimer levels. There was no significant difference in pre-operative plasma D-dimer levels (0.5963 ± 0.2047 mg/l in Group I, 0.6344 ± 0.1348 mg/l in Group II, P = 0.815, Mann-Whitney U-test). However, mean plasma D-dimer value for Group II was significantly higher than that in the control group (1.2267 ± 0.3099 versus 0.6213 ± 0.2346 mg/l, respectively, Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001), following 2 h of ovarian torsion. Ovarian tissue damage scores were also statistically significantly different among groups. If the observations made in a rat model are extended to humans, plasma D-dimer measurement may be a valuable parameter in the early diagnosis of ovarian torsion."

Unfortunately risks associated with such management, including maternal death, are coming to the fore. This paper highlights the risks and how they could be avoided. The risks include rupture of ectopic pregnancy during treatment with methotrexate or during expectant management, inadvertent administration of methotrexate to viable early intrauterine pregnancy, methotrexate embryopathy, allergic reaction to methotrexate, development of methotrexate pneumonitis and fatal administration of methotrexate to a woman with a concurrent medical problem. There is an urgent need for appropriate risk management procedures to be applied in units where non-surgical (i.e. expectant or medical) management of ectopic pregnancy is offered. Risk management should address organisational issues such as safe handling of the chemotherapeutic agent, prescription and supply, consent (informed choice), documentation and adequacy of follow-up arrangements. Women undergoing non-surgical management should have ready access (for example by telephone) to professional advice and to surgical intervention in the event of an emergency."

Ultrasonography is known to be a modality of choice in EP diagnostics. We found a severe discrepancy between the frequency of ectopic pregnancies (EP) and the number of available computed tomography (CT) examinations. A 29-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and collapse. Sonographic findings of a suspected EP were unclear. Moreover, not all features of intrauterine pregnancy were present. Due to the patient's life-threatening condition, an emergency multi-slice CT with MPR and VRT reconstructions was performed, revealing symptoms of a ruptured EP. In the right adnexal area, a well-vascularized, solid-cystic abnormal mass lesion was found. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage was confirmed intraoperatively, and the right fallopian tube with a tubal EP was resected. In the surgery in situ, as well as in the pathological examination of the tumor mass, a human embryo of approximately 1.5 cm in length (beginning of the 8(th) week of gestation) was found. Although ultrasonography still remains the first-line imaging examination in EP diagnostics, sometimes the findings of suspected EPs are unclear and not sufficient. The rupture of EP, with serious bleeding and symptoms of shock, may require an emergent pelvic and abdominal CT inspection. A clear correlation was found between the macroscopic CT images and the intraoperatively sampled material."

This was a prospective study at an urban academic emergency department from August 1999 through July 2006. Patients with first-trimester vaginal bleeding or pain underwent EBS followed by pelvic sonography (PS) by the Department of Radiology. Results of EBS were compared with those of PS using a predesigned standardized data sheet. A total of 670 patients underwent EBS for first-trimester pregnancy complications by 1 of 25 physicians who would go on to perform at least 25 examinations. The sensitivity and specificity of EBS for an intrauterine pregnancy increased from 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71%-87%) and 86% (95% CI, 76%-93%), respectively, for a physician's first 10 examinations to 100% (95% CI, 73%-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 63%-100%) for those performed after 40 examinations. Likewise, the sensitivity and specificity for an adnexal mass or ectopic pregnancy changed from 43% (95% CI, 28%-64%) and 94% (95% CI, 89%-97%) to 75% (95% CI, 22%-99%) and 89% (95% CI, 65%-98%), whereas the sensitivity and specificity for a molar pregnancy changed from 71% (95% CI, 30%-95%) and 98% (95% CI, 94%-99%) to 100% (95% CI, 20%-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 81%-100%). Although detection of an intrauterine or a molar pregnancy improved with training, even with experience including 40 examinations, the sensitivity of EBS for an adnexal mass or ectopic pregnancy was less than 90%.

Pelvic ultrasonography by emergency physicians has been investigated as a diagnostic test for ectopic pregnancy. We present a meta-analysis of the use of emergency physician ultrasonography in the evaluation of patients at risk of ectopic pregnancy. A structured search was performed of both MEDLINE and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria were that (1) the study reported original research on ED patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy; (2) an emergency physician performed and interpreted the initial pelvic ultrasonography; and (3) follow-up was conducted on all patients. Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of patients with ectopic pregnancy for which ED ultrasonography demonstrated no intrauterine pregnancy. A random-effects model was used to obtain summary test characteristics. The initial search showed 576 publications, abstract review yielded 60 with potential relevance, and 10 studies were included. There was a total of 2,057 patients, of whom 152 (7.5%) had ectopic pregnancy. The pooled sensitivity estimate was 99.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 96.6% to 100%), negative predictive value was 99.96% (95% CI 99.6% to 100%), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.08 (95% CI 0.025 to 0.25), all without significant heterogeneity. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that in a wide variety of clinical settings, the use of bedside ultrasonography performed by emergency physicians as a diagnostic test for ectopic pregnancy provides excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value. Visualization of an intrauterine pregnancy by an emergency physician is generally sufficient to rule out ectopic pregnancy."

The case is described of a 28-year-old primigravida who originally presented to the emergency department with right lower abdominal pain. The patient was ultimately found to have an extremely large cystic teratoma of the right ovary with concomitant torsion. Bedside ultrasonography is a highly accessible tool that can be used in a pregnant woman for screening a mass or ascites. Laparoscopic surgery has now been accepted as a safe modality for definitive diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. Because acute ovarian torsion is not encountered frequently, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimise morbidity. It is important to keep ovarian torsion in the differential diagnosis of any pregnant woman with acute abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should be aware of the possibility of acute ovarian torsion in pregnant women and should have a high index of suspicion. Early surgical intervention should be undertaken."

She was unable to provide a urine sample during initial evaluation, and a drop of whole blood was therefore applied to a qualitative urine human chorionic gonadotropin point-of-care test. This test result was positive for pregnancy, ultrasound revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity, and emergency laparotomy by our gynecologists confirmed ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Often, patients are too unstable or dehydrated to provide a urine sample; and serum human chorionic gonadotropin testing may be difficult to obtain in a timely fashion.

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of pelvic pain in women can be challenging because many symptoms and signs are insensitive and nonspecific. As the first priority, urgent life-threatening conditions (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, ruptured ovarian cyst) and fertility-threatening conditions (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion) must be considered. A careful history focusing on pain characteristics, review of systems, and gynecologic, sexual, and social history, in addition to physical examination helps narrow the differential diagnosis. The most common urgent causes of pelvic pain are pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian cyst, and appendicitis; however, many other diagnoses in the differential may mimic these conditions, and imaging is often needed. Transvaginal ultrasonography should be the initial imaging test because of its sensitivities across most etiologies and its lack of radiation exposure. A high index of suspicion should be maintained for pelvic inflammatory disease when other etiologies are ruled out, because the presentation is variable and the prevalence is high. Multiple studies have shown that 20 to 50 percent of women presenting with pelvic pain have pelvic inflammatory disease. Adolescents and pregnant and postpartum women require unique considerations."

A 27-year-old, whose husband carries a balanced translocation, presented on stimulation day 11 (day after human chorionic gonadotrophin administration) with signs of right ovarian torsion. Transvaginal ultrasound identified decreased right ovarian venous flow but preservation of right ovarian arterial flow. She underwent emergency laparoscopic right ovarian detorsion followed by vaginal oocyte retrieval on postoperative day 1. Ten oocytes were retrieved from the right detorted ovary, 4/10 (40%) were fertilized and 3/4 (75%) became blastocysts. Fifteen oocytes were retrieved from the left ovary, 14/15 (93%) were fertilized and 9/14 (64%) became blastocysts. All 18 embryos biopsied for preimplantation genetic diagnosis carried unbalanced translocations and none were transferred. The markedly reduced fertilization rate of the oocytes from the previously torted ovary is similar to the rate described in a prior report and likely related to decreased but maintained ovarian arterial flow. This report is unique because not only was the patient's ovarian torsion surgically corrected prior to oocyte retrieval but also the embryos originating from the previously torted ovary had excellent development with 75% progressing to the blastocyst stage."

Expedient diagnosis and treatment are important, particularly in young fertile patients to preserve ovarian viability. Classical parameters for the clinical and sonographic diagnosis of adnexal torsion have very high false-positive rates, approaching 50%. The sonographic 'whirlpool' sign has been shown to be effective for visualizing the torsed part in the prenatal diagnosis of malrotation of the midgut with volvulus, as well as scrotal and ovarian torsion. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the whirlpool sign in the diagnosis of torsion, as compared to a protocol based on 'classic' sonographic signs of torsion alone. This was a retrospective chart review. Files of all patients who underwent laparoscopy for suspected torsion at our center between January 2006 and May 2009 were extracted and reviewed. Ultrasound reports were retrieved from our computerized database. Patients were assigned to the study group if the whirlpool sign had been investigated during pre-procedural evaluation or to the control group if only the standard protocol had been applied. Eighty women were referred for laparoscopy for suspected adnexal torsion during the study period. In 22 women the ultrasound investigation had included the whirlpool sign (study group) while 58 had been examined by the standard protocol (control group). Twenty women in the study group had a positive whirlpool sign on ultrasound, 18 of whom (90.0%) had confirmed torsion on laparoscopy. In the control group 32 of 58 (55.2%) women had confirmed torsion on laparoscopy. The addition of the sonographic whirlpool sign to the preoperative sonographic evaluation of patients with suspected torsion appears to improve the rate of true-positive diagnoses as confirmed by laparoscopy.

Data from each article were abstracted independently by two reviewers. In the studies of mifepristone, 3 of 494 (0.6%) pregnancies were ectopic; in the levonorgestrel studies, 3 of 307 (1%) were ectopic. The rate of ectopic pregnancy when treatment with emergency contraceptive pills fails does not exceed the rate observed in the general population.

Transvaginal sonography exhibited a heterogeneous hypoechoic shadow in the endometrium that suggested a hematometra including blood clots and tissue, and a multicystic echogenic mass, with flow at color Doppler ultrasonography, in the lateral wall of the uterus. A laparoscopic cornuostomy was performed. Pathologic analysis demonstrated placental tissue with features consistent with a partial molar pregnancy. Systemic methotrexate therapy was administered to treat the possible remnants of the molar pregnancy. Molar cornual ectopic pregnancy can be successfully treated with laparoscopic cornuostomy and systemic methotrexate therapy."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a high-risk medical condition with an incidence of 1.9% in reported pregnancies, and has proven to be the most common cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester. The clinical symptoms can mimic non-EP conditions, thus creating a challenge for developing diagnostic criteria and new diagnostic tools. Early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is essential in order to minimize the morbidity and to assess the need for urgent surgical intervention. Currently, ultrasound and serum biomarkers are used by clinicians for early detection and diagnosis. This review summarizes and comments on the available literature on the various markers including their utility and their statistical parameters."

    "abstract": "To describe a new technique for the management of Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy (CSEP): transrectal ultrasound (TRS)-guided surgical evacuation. All women who presented at our early pregnancy units (EPU) from November 2006 to July 2008 underwent transvaginal sonography. CSEP was diagnosed if all of the following criteria were met: absence of an intrauterine pregnancy; empty endocervical canal; presence of a gestational sac implanted within the lower anterior segment of the uterine corpus, with or without evidence of myometrial thinning. Women were offered TRS-guided surgical evacuation under general anesthesia. Successful treatment was defined as complete primary evacuation of the CSEP. The need to perform additional interventions (emergency cervical cerclage, insertion of Foley's balloon catheter, blood transfusions) was recorded. Of 1195 consecutive women who presented at the EPUs, seven (0.59%) were diagnosed with CSEP. Three (43%) of these were viable at the time of diagnosis. Two (29%) of the seven pregnancies followed in-vitro fertilization; six (86%) women had previously had a single Cesarean section and one had had two. One of these women had a previous tubal ectopic pregnancy, and one a previous CSEP. Three (43%) of the women were asymptomatic. Five (71%) women were treated with TRS-guided surgical evacuation as the primary treatment, whilst two (29%) were given systemic methotrexate, one of whom subsequently underwent TRS-guided aspiration because of failure of conservative management. There were no major complications. The best treatment for CSEP has yet to be established. TRS-guided surgical evacuation is a novel and potentially alternative treatment modality. However, in the absence of further studies we cannot draw any conclusions, and the management of such women should be individualized."

A 48-year-old woman with ovarian torsion strictly turned down emergent surgery against the recommendation of her gynecologist, who could not communicate with her. In response to his request, a psychiatrist examined and diagnosed her as schizophrenia. Therefore, she was transferred to our hospital for management in closed wards. She was so paranoiac and self-defensive that we, the psychiatrist, the gynecologist, and the anesthesiologist, could not obtain informed consent for the operation from her. Because this was an emergent and life-threatening case, we attempted anesthesia and surgery with the consent of her mother and uncle. First, we took her not directly to the operating room but to ICU to relieve her anxiety and fear. Then, we intubated her under sedation and analgesia. Finally, we took her to the operating room and started the operation. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5-2.0% sevoflurane and fentanyl (total 9 microg x kg(-1)). The operation was uneventful and she was retransferred to ICU with the tracheal tube in place. Next day she was extubated and left ICU. She was informed by her psychiatrist of the fact that the operation had been performed. Fortunately, her mental status and postoperative course was generally stable."

Centers for Disease Control guidelines and recent clinical practice literature were searched to provide guidance on how to diagnose, treat, and educate the patient with PID. The incidence of PID is approximately 1 million women annually. PID is diagnosed in 1%-2% of sexually active women under the age of 25, with a higher incidence in African American women. Women with PID produce over 2 million emergency room and office visits and incur health care costs of over 4 billion dollars annually. PID is associated with chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Symptoms can range from subtle and indolent to acute and fulminant. Having a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis will assist the NP in treating patients with this disease. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated in all women at risk who have uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness on a bimanual exam with no other explanation for these symptoms. Without response to treatment, if the diagnosis is unclear, or if a surgical emergency is being considered, prompt referral to a specialist is warranted. Secondary preventive measures are discussed."

    "abstract": "This is a case report of a primary abdominal pregnancy managed by laparoscopic intervention. A 22 year old, gravida 1, woman was admitted to our emergency room with vaginal bleeding and pain in lower abdomen. She was 4 weeks pregnant according to her last menstrual period. She had undergone right salpingoophorectomy previously. Pelvic examination revealed cervical motion tenderness, bilateral adnexal tenderness and rebound tenderness. Her vital signs were normal. Beta hCG was 15826 IU/ml and hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dl. Transvaginal sonography showed an endometrium of 3 mm thickness and free fluid in the pelvis. Upon admission to the Early Pregnancy Clinic, abdominal pain became worse and hemoglobin decreased to 8.0 g/dL. Therefore, we performed a laparoscopy which showed that the uterus, left tube and ovary were completely normal with absence of the right ovary and tube. Approximately 500 cc blood was aspirated from the pelvis. Between the right sacrouterine ligament and rectum, there was a bleeding area 2 cm in width which was removed with forceps and sent for frozen pathological examination,which revealed 'placental tissue fragments'. Endometrial sampling was reported to be 'secretory endometrium'. A rapid decrease in the beta HCG post operative titer confirmed the resolution of the pregnancy. Primary abdominal pregnancy is extremely rare. The diagnosis is confirmed according to Studdiford's criteria. In the literature, there only a few cases of abdominal pregnancy in which laparoscopic procedure has been used effectively as treatment. However, laparoscopic procedure is usually successful in treatment of abdominal pregnancy if the gestational age is early enough. Kliniğimizde laparoskopik olarak tedavi edilen bir primer abdominal gebelik olgusunu sunduk. 22 yaşında, gravida 1 olan hasta acil servise vajinal kanama ve alt abdominal ağrı yakınmasıyla başvurdu. Son adet tarihine göre yaklaşık 4 haftalık gebe olduğu ve daha önce tuboovaryan torsiyon tanısıyla sağ salpingoooferektomi yapıldığı öğrenildi. Pelvik muayenede serviks hareketleri ağrılıydı, bilateral adneksal hassasiyet ve rebound mevcuttu. Vital bulguları stabildi. Beta-hCG: 15826 IU/mL, Hb: 10.0 g/dL idi. Transvajinal ultrasonografide pelviste yaygın sıvı vardı, endometrium kalınlığı 3 mm, intrauterin ve/veya ektopik gebelik izlenmiyordu. Erken Gebelik Kliniği’ne kabulünde hastanın karın ağrısı arttı, Hb: 8.0 g/dL ye düştü. Hastaya intraabdominal kanama tanısıyla laparoskopik cerrahi uygulandı. Laparoskopide sağ over ve sağ tubanın cerrahi yokluk halinde olduğu izlendi. Uterus, sol over ve sol tuba normal görünümdeydi. Douglas boşluğundan yaklaşık 500 cc kan aspire edildi. Sağ sakrouterin ligament ile rektum arasında 2 cm genişliğinde kanamalı alan izlendi ve çıkarıldı. Doku örneği frozen incelemeye gönderildi, sonuç plasental doku parçaları olarak bildirildi. Aynı anda yapılan endometrial örnekleme sonucu sekretuar endometrium olarak rapor edildi. Post operatif dönemde beta-hCG değerlerinde hızlı bir düşüş izlendi.

    "abstract": "Early pregnancy bleeding is a common presentation in the emergency setting. Traditionally, its assessment relied on clinical findings, including pelvic examination. However in recent years, ultrasonography and quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin assays have gained prominence and are now first-line in diagnosing early pregnancy bleeding. Accordingly, the role of pelvic examination in the acute setting has been increasingly questioned. This article reviews the evidence for the role of pelvic examination in the assessment of early pregnancy bleeding in the ED. A Medline search was conducted and 43 articles were included in this review. Applicable research is largely observational and of a low level of evidence. However, available data indicate that the role of pelvic examination in the assessment of early pregnancy bleeding is limited, providing that there is prompt access to transvaginal ultrasound examination. Pelvic examination does not provide further diagnostic information over ultrasonography used in conjunction with beta human chorionic gonadotropin assays. The routine use of pelvic examination is not supported by the literature. However, when ultrasonography and beta human chorionic gonadotropin testing are unavailable or the results inconclusive, pelvic examination should be considered. Assessment in these instances must focus on identifying possible life-threatening conditions, such as ectopic pregnancy, as well as determining the safety of discharge pending definitive assessment. Speculum examination is indicated in those presenting with severe bleeding or hypotension as removal of obstructing endocervical products can be a crucial resuscitative measure."

With the advent of improved diagnostic techniques like high-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography and expedient serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) assay, ectopic pregnancy is now diagnosed early. At this stage, the conceptus is often small, causing minimal or no symptoms. Medical management may then present an appealing alternative to surgery. Methotrexate has been widely used to treat ectopic pregnancy. A methotrexate ectopic treatment protocol was introduced by the Minimally Invasive Surgery Centre at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore. We present the results of this treatment. A prospective review of 110 cases of medical management of ectopic pregnancy since the implementation of the treatment protocol was undertaken. Demographical data, clinical presentation, treatment progress and outcome were captured using a computer database. All patients were managed as outpatients, and a telephone call-out service was provided to ensure that treatment side effects were monitored and potential treatment failures were identified early. From August 2003 to October 2006, 93 (84.5 percent) patients with ectopic pregnancy were successfully treated with intramuscular methotrexate. 16 patients eventually required surgery and only one patient defaulted on follow-up. There was no major side effect detected in this cohort. The minor side effects reported included mucositis (19.1 percent) and abdominal pain (28.2 percent). Methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy is safe. Our treatment protocol enabled us to achieve a reasonable treatment success rate of 84.5 percent."

The EPAC was opened in August 2005 at North York General Hospital. The number of patients being assessed, the sources of referral, the reasons for referral and the treatments provided in the clinic between January 2006 and December 2007 were reviewed. The number of patients attending the ER with the diagnoses of miscarriage, early pregnancy hemorrhage, and ectopic pregnancy one year prior to the opening of the EPAC (July 2004 to June 2005, year 0), during the first subsequent year (January to December 2006, year 1) and the second subsequent year (January to December 2007, year 2) were reviewed. Of the 1448 referrals to the EPAC during the two-year period, 38% were referred from the ER, 31% from family physicians, 24% from obstetricians, 2% from midwives, and 5% from other sources. The reasons for referral included confirmed missed miscarriage (450 patients, 31%), threatened miscarriage (471, 32.5%), complete miscarriage (182, 12.6%), ectopic pregnancy (111, 7.7%), incomplete miscarriage (59, 4.1%), hyperemesis gravidarum (23, 1.6%), and others (152, 10.5%). Through arrangements made by the clinic, 200 women underwent dilatation and curettage, and 133 were administered misoprostol to induce miscarriage. Fifty-seven patients with ectopic pregnancy received medical treatment with methotrexate, and 13 patients had surgery for ectopic pregnancy. There was no significant change in the total number of patients being assessed in the ER for early pregnancy hemorrhage, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy before and after the opening of the EPAC. However, there was a significant reduction in the number of repeat assessments in the ER for ectopic pregnancy, from 37% in year 0 (n = 24/65) to 24% in year 1 (n = 14/54) and 14.5% in year 2 (n = 9/62). There was also a trend towards a reduction in the number of repeat assessments in the ER for hemorrhage (year 0 = 32.4%; year 1 = 29.4%; year 2 = 27.5%), and miscarriage (year 0 = 19.5%; year 1 = 12.6%; year 2 = 16.9%). The EPAC is of significant value in the management of early pregnancy complications. It is particularly useful in the follow-up of patients with ectopic pregnancy and also helps to reduce the number of patients attending the ER for follow-up of other early pregnancy complications."

We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) (2002 to 2006) to test trends and predictors of the new measure, using both restrictive and broad definitions from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and reason-for-visit codes, and determine the proportion of women with ectopic pregnancy who had undergone pregnancy testing. For comparison, we conducted a detailed chart review in 4 US hospitals among patients who visited the ED in 2006. Using a broad ICD-9 definition for inclusion in NHAMCS, 2.13 million women aged 14 to 50 years with abdominal pain visited an ED annually between 2002 and 2006. Of those, 33.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.5% to 35.5%) received pregnancy testing. Testing rates were materially stable, regardless of the definition used (broad or restrictive ICD-9 or reason-for-visit code). Among women with an ICD-9 diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, 55.6% (95% CI 43.7% to 67.6%) had a documented pregnancy test. In the chart review, among 200 women aged 14 to 50 years and with abdominal pain, 89.4% (95% CI 85.0% to 94.0%) were eligible for the measure; of those, 93.9% (95% CI 90.3% to 97.4%) received testing. Analysis of national ED survey data demonstrated a large performance gap for a new pregnancy testing quality measure, whereas focused chart review at 4 sites showed a smaller gap. Given these discrepancies, additional study is recommended before the widespread implementation of the pregnancy testing measure as an assessment of ED performance."

Although the conventional treatment is salpingo-oophorectomy, recent studies advocate detorsion. We hypothesized that iloprost, an analogue of prostacyclin with cytoprotective properties, may prevent the harmful effects of ischaemia-reperfusion injury in bilateral ovaries after unilateral ovarian torsion-detorsion in rat. In this study, 24 female Wistar-albino female rats were divided into four groups. Ovarian torsion was produced by applying vascular clamps to right ovaries. In Group I, bilateral oophorectomy was performed. In group II, bilateral oophorectomy was performed after a unilateral torsion period of 4h. In group III, bilateral ovaries were removed, following unilateral torsion-detorsion periods each lasted for 4h. Saline was injected i.p. 30 min before detorsion. In group IV, same experimental protocol, which was conducted in group III, was repeated. Iloprost was injected i.p. 30 min before detorsion instead of saline in group IV. Tissue levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO), which are the indicators for oxidative stress were determined and histopathological evaluation was performed in bilateral ovaries in all groups. The MDA and NO levels for ipsilateral ovaries of four groups were compared and no significant difference was found (p>0.05). The same comparison were done for the contralateral sides and no difference was seen either (p>0.05). In histological examination, iloprost produced improvement in I/R-induced alterations in ipsilateral and contralateral ovaries. In conclusion, these results showed that iloprost has beneficial effect on the histological appearances in both the ipsilateral and contralateral rat ovaries after unilateral torsion-detorsion."

If underestimated or suboptimally treated, both can lead to an inadequate tissue perfusion (defined as shock) and the development of multi-organ failure. Morbidity and mortality after development of one of the shock syndromes (septic or haemorrhagic) correlates directly with the duration and severity of the malperfusion. The patient's prognosis depends on a prompt diagnosis of the presence of shock and immediate resuscitation to predefined physiological end-points, often before the cause of the shock has been identified. In septic shock, hypotension is primarily treated with fluid administration and eventually vasopressors, if required, in order to improve the circulation. Timely administration of antibiotics, control of infectious foci, appropriate use of corticoids and recombinant human activated protein C, tight glucose control, prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention complete the therapy of septic shock. In haemorrhagic shock, the treatment primarily involves controlling haemorrhage, reversal of possible coagulopathy and administration of sufficient volumes of fluids and blood products to restore normal tissue perfusion."

We sought to systematically review the evidence describing the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of EDTU in the first trimester of pregnancy, and to generate a pooled estimate of the sensitivity and specificity of EDTU for the detection of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP). The literature search, abstract review and study selection were performed using predefined criteria. We abstracted the sensitivity and specificity of EDTU for IUP from included studies, and evaluated and summarized the evidence assessing the effect of EDTU use on time to diagnosis, time to treatment of ectopic pregnancy, emergency department (ED) length of stay and health care costs. The specificity of EDTU for IUP in most studies exceeds 98%. The sensitivity in most studies exceeds 90%. Pooled estimates were not calculated because of statistical heterogeneity between studies. Published evidence indicates that EDTU use reduces the frequency of missed ectopic pregnancies, decreases time to surgery for ectopic pregnancy, shortens the length of stay for patients with normal pregnancies and may be more cost-effective than diagnostic strategies requiring formal ultrasonography. EDTU is highly specific for the identification of IUP. Patients who have an IUP identified with EDTU may be safely discharged from the ED with outpatient follow-up. The specificity of EDTU for IUP, along with the potential improvements in patient care that EDTU affords, justifies its adoption as routine ED care in evaluating first-trimester pain or bleeding."

    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion (OT) occurs primarily in women of child-bearing age, but is rare in the pediatric population. The clinical presentation often consists of nonspecific abdominal complaints making the diagnosis difficult. Radiologic and sonographic evidence can be misleading. Although the delay in diagnosis from symptom onset is common, rapid diagnosis of ovarian torsion is imperative to prevent morbidity. We present the case of a four-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a five-day history of intermittent abdominal pain and emesis. Initial diagnosis was suspicious for intussusception; however, on operative exploration, she was found to have a right adnexal torsion secondary to an ovarian teratoma. A right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Early diagnosis of ovarian torsion may increase ovarian salvage and reduce morbidity. Faced with abdominal pain of uncertain etiology in a female child, emergency physicians should include ovarian torsion secondary to an ovarian mass in the differential diagnosis."

Acute ovarian torsion in children is rare, especially at a very young age, and a difficult diagnosis to make. Infarction caused by ovarian torsion will result if the twist is not unwound spontaneously or surgically in a timely fashion. We presented a case of acute ovarian cyst torsion in a 2-year-old girl who originally presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting. Ultimately, she was found to have a 2-cm cyst of the right ovary with concomitant torsion. Because acute ovarian torsion in a very young child is not encountered frequently, timely diagnosis is required to prevent mortality and minimize morbidity. It is important to keep ovarian torsion in the differential of any female children with acute abdominal pain. Emergency physicians should be aware that the potential of acute ovarian torsion in a very young child has a high index of suspicion and seek early operative intervention."

This pathology was located in 5 cases on the right side and in 3 cases on the left side; a case of bilateral torsion of poly-cystic ovary was encountered in a girl with down syndrome. Clinical presentation is made in all the cases by abdominal pains and vomiting. The disorders of the transit and the urinary signs are associated in 3 and 2 cases respectively, the clinical examination objectified a pelvic defense in all the cases and an abdominal mass in 2 cases. Pelvic ultra-sonography was made in 6 observations and give the diagnosis of torsion of the ovary in 4 cases, whereas it was doubtful in the 2 remaining cases when an ovarian mass was observed. In the 3 remaining cases, this examination was not performed since one the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was retained and the patient operated in emergency. All the children of our series were operated; in 1/3 of the cases we found a necrosis of the ovary. 4 cases out of 9 present a torsion on pathologic ovary (cyst, dysplasia), whereas in the 5 remaining cases, we noted a torsion on healthy ovary. 4 young girls have undergoes a annexectomy, of which one was bilateral.

    "abstract": "In this study, an endovaginal ultrasound (US) task trainer was combined with a high-fidelity US mannequin to create a hybrid simulation model. In a scenario depicting a patient with ectopic pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock, this model was compared with a standard high-fidelity simulation during training sessions with emergency medicine (EM) residents. The authors hypothesized that use of the hybrid model would increase both the residents' self-reported educational experience and the faculty's self-reported ability to evaluate the residents' skills. A total of 45 EM residents at two institutions were randomized into two groups. Each group was assigned to one of two formats involving an ectopic pregnancy scenario. One format incorporated the new hybrid model, in which residents had to manipulate an endovaginal US probe in a task trainer; the other used the standard high-fidelity simulation mannequin together with static photo images. After finishing the scenario, residents self-rated their overall learning experience and how well the scenario evaluated their ability to interpret endovaginal US images. Faculty members reviewed video recordings of the other institution's residents and rated their own ability to evaluate residents' skills in interpreting endovaginal US images and diagnosing and managing the case scenario. Visual analog scales (VAS) were used for the self-ratings. Compared to the residents assigned to the standard simulation scenario, residents assigned to the hybrid model reported an increase in their overall educational experience (Delta VAS = 10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4 to 18) and felt the hybrid model was a better measure of their ability to interpret endovaginal US images (Delta VAS = 17, 95% CI = 7 to 28). Faculty members found the hybrid model to be better than the standard simulation for evaluating residents' skills in interpreting endovaginal US images (Delta VAS = 13, 95% CI = 6 to 20) and diagnosing and managing the case (Delta VAS = 10, 95% CI = 2 to 18). Time to reach a diagnosis was similar in both groups (p = 0.053). Use of a hybrid simulation model combining a high-fidelity simulation with an endovaginal US task trainer improved residents' educational experience and improved faculty's ability to evaluate residents' endovaginal US and clinical skills. This novel hybrid tool should be considered for future education and evaluation of EM residents."

She was undergoing clomiphene (CC) induction for infertility and had a positive urine pregnancy test at home. A right adnexal ectopic pregnancy was reported by ultrasonography. Due to increasing pain, laparoscopy was performed. The uterus and fallopian tubes appeared normal without any signs of pregnancy. A well-vascularized intact omental gestational sac was discovered in the right adnexal region in close proximity to the right ovary. By laparoscopy, the sac was resected with partial omentectomy. A primary omental pregnancy was confirmed by beta-hCG-positive trophoblast cells among omental fat cells. Omental pregnancy is rather difficult to identify due to localization. When in close proximity to the adnexal region, it may mimic a tubal ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopy offers a minimally invasive method for diagnosis and therapy."

Despite the recent advances in the ultrasonography, diagnosis of cornual pregnancy still remains elusive; with confirmatory diagnosis usually made during laparotomy. The aim of the present study is to analyze the obstetric implications and the diagnostic dilemma of rudimentary horn pregnancy. Records of women diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy in the rudimentary horn, during the years 2004 to 2008, managed in a referral hospital in northern India; were reviewed for their diagnostic difficulties and the associated morbidity. During the four year study period, rudimentary horn pregnancies accounted for 12 pregnancies. Non communicating horn accounted for 75% of the cases. The mean age of women at presentation was 26 +/- 5.11 years and the period of gestation at diagnosis varied between 10 and 34 weeks. Preruputure diagnosis was possible only in two cases and sensitivity of ultrasonographic diagnosis was 33.3%. Laprotomy with excision of rudimentary horn and salpingectomy was done in all cases. Multiple blood transfusions were required in 83.3% of women. Management of pregnancy in a rudimentary uterine horn continues to be a challenge to this day. Maintaining a higher degree of alertness, especially in high risk groups by emergency staff is required to prevent the morbidity, as they may present with acute uterine rupture in pregnancy."

A 41-year-old woman treated with hemodialysis for over 18 years was brought to the emergency room at our institution because of acute abdominal pain. Ultrasonography detected an abdominal fluid collection, and her anemia had worsened (hematocrit 18%). Emergency laparoscopic exploration disclosed a hemorrhagic corpus luteum of pregnancy, causing ovarian bleeding on the left. Coagulation of bleeding points was carried out. At this time, pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation was discovered. After the procedures, hemodialysis frequency was increased to 5 times weekly, and an erythropoietin derivative was administered to maintain a hematocrit above 30%. The patient developed no hypertension. At 33 weeks of gestation, cesarean section was performed because of a decrease in amniotic fluid and frequent late deceleration of the fetal heart rate. A live baby girl weighing 1,422 g was born. The successful pregnancy reflects remarkable progress in dialysis technology. Pregnancy, then, can underlie an acute abdomen in childbearing-age women (14 - 44 years old) undergoing long-term dialysis."

    "abstract": "Although fibroids constitute the most common tumour in women of reproductive age, it is remarkable how very rarely they cause acute complications. However, when they do occur, the acute complications can cause significant morbidity (very occasionally, mortality), profoundly affecting a woman's quality of life. The complications include thrombo-embolism, acute torsion of subserosal pedunculated leiomyomata, acute urinary retention and renal failure, acute pain caused by red degeneration during pregnancy, acute vaginal or intra-peritoneal haemorrhage, mesenteric vein thrombosis and intestinal gangrene. The obstetrician will be most familiar with red degeneration and acute urinary retention, both of which tend to occur in association with pregnancy. It is difficult to quote an incidence rate for these acute complications as they are rare, and most are reported as cases or case series in the literature. The majority (except red degeneration, acute urinary retention and thrombo-embolism) presents as an acute abdomen and requires urgent exploratory surgery. The differential diagnosis would include twisted adnexa, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, haemorrhagic corpus luteum or follicular cyst, whilst that of the pelvic mass would be ovarian or endometrial carcinoma, uterine sarcoma or leiomyoma and, rarely, ovarian fibroma. Deep vein thrombosis is usually due to pelvic venous compression, and while some have advocated that its occurrence in association with a fibroid mass should be an absolute indication for hysterectomy, sophisticated use of radiological adjuncts at surgery, such as 'umbrellas' and haematological support with appropriate anticoagulation, could enable uterine-preserving surgery. The diagnosis of fibroids as a cause of acute urinary retention should be one of exclusion. The treatment of the acute fibroid in pregnancy is of course conservative, definitive treatment being postponed until postpartum."

At six weeks and one day 50 mg intramuscular methotrexate (MTX) was started and repeated three days later. At six weeks + six days the patient had vaginal bleeding so she was submitted to an emergency surgical procedure consisting of dilatation and curettage followed by a Foley balloon tamponade, which was gradually deflated and removed after two days. Early diagnosis and an appropriate MTX regimen in combination with adjuvant conservative procedures allow successful treatment of a cervical pregnancy, preserving the uterus and future reproductive outcome.

Seventy-eight women who underwent laparoscopy for suspected OT. Laparoscopy. Rate of true diagnosis of torsion, correlation with Doppler studies. The preoperative diagnosis of OT was confirmed in only 36 (46.1%) of the patients. Immediate operation (<10 hours) after admission (n = 48) was associated with a statistically significantly higher likelihood of operatively confirming OT (56.2% vs. 28.6%). We found that the lack of ovarian blood flow on Doppler sonography was a good predictor of OT; women with pathologic flow were statistically significantly more likely to have OT (77% vs. 29%). The sensitivity and specificity of abnormal ovarian flow for OT were 43.8% and 91.7%, respectively, with a positive and negative predictive value of 78% and 71%, respectively. Despite 20 years of research, the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of OT remains low.

It is also reported to be as high as 1% after the use of assisted reproductive technology, but Clomiphene Citrate which increases the rate of twinning, could be associated with a heterotopic pregnancy rate of 1/900, which is much less than using assisted reproductive technology. Heterotopic pregnancies are diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for obstetricians. If they continue without diagnosis, a life-threatening situation may occur even when surgical intervention with laparotomy is performed. We present the case of a 22-year-old Iranian woman who developed a simultaneous extra -and intrauterine pregnancy after the induction of ovulation with Clomiphene. In this case, there was a delay in the detection of the ectopic pregnancy component resulting in an emergency laparotomy being performed. Fortunately after the laparotomy, the intrauterine pregnancy was not affected and it progressed satisfactorily until 37 weeks. A healthy male baby was delivered by caesarean section. This case suggests that a heterotopic pregnancy must always be considered in patients presenting with pelvic pain even in a confirmed intrauterine pregnancy, particularly after the induction of ovulation by Clomiphene Citrate or assisted reproductive technology. Every clinician treating women of reproductive age should keep this diagnosis in mind. It also demonstrates that early diagnosis is essential in order to salvage the intrauterine pregnancy and avoid maternal morbidity and mortality."

The objective of this article is to present a case of pediatric ovarian torsion and to review its epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. A 3-year-old girl presented to the ED with vomiting, fever, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Initially diagnosed with appendicitis by physical examination and computed tomography scan, this patient was taken to the operating room for surgical exploration. The patient was subsequently found to have ovarian torsion, which was treated appropriately. Although a rare phenomenon, this case serves to increase awareness of the clinical presentation of ovarian torsion in the pediatric patient. Abdominal pain in the female child represents a challenging differential diagnosis, for which a physician must consider ovarian torsion."

We compared patients' symptom presentations, objective findings and surgical outcomes between patients who underwent laparotomy and those who received laparoscopy, and between patients admitted via the emergency room and those via the outpatient department. The most common symptom and sign was pelvic pain (82.1%), followed by nausea and vomiting (49.7%), elevated white blood count (20.1%), lower urinary tract symptoms (14.5%) and fever (7.8%). An adnexal or pelvic mass could be detected using gynecological ultrasound in almost all of the patients (98.3%). Ovarian torsion was considered among the admission differential diagnoses in 51.4% of patients. One hundred and five patients (58.7%) seen in the emergency room were more likely to present with nausea and vomiting, sudden pain onset and peritoneal signs than those seen in the outpatient department. Patients undergoing laparoscopy had a smaller sized ovarian mass; they were less likely to require oophorectomy; they had a shorter hospital stay; and fewer of them suffered from postoperative fever compared to patients undergoing laparotomy. Discriminant analysis showed that mass size was the single determining factor for choice of operating methods. The diagnosis of OT is missed in half of the patients because clinical features are unspecific and objective findings are uncommon. The laparoscopy procedure for ovarian conservation is recommended to treat patients suffering from OT owing to its shorter hospital stay, fewer postoperative complications and ovarian preservation."

In the pregnant patient with pelvic pain or bleeding, an ectopic pregnancy must be first excluded. Ultrasound is important in determining the size and location of the ectopic pregnancy, and presence of bleeding, which in turn helps guide treatment decisions. Subchorionic or subplacental bleeds in an intrauterine pregnancy may also present with vaginal bleeding with consequences dependent on gestational age and size of bleed. In the postpartum female suspected to have retained products of conception, sonographic findings may vary from a thickened endometrial stripe to an echogenic mass with associated marked vascularity, often mimicking an arterial-venous malformation. In the nonpregnant patient, early diagnosis and treatment of ovarian torsion can preserve ovarian function. Other causes of peritoneal irritation may also cause acute pelvic pain including a ruptured hemorrhagic cyst or ruptured endometrioma. When pelvic inflammatory disease is suspected, imaging is used to evaluate for serious associated complications including the presence of a tuboovarian abscess or peritonitis. While leiomyomas of the uterus are largely asymptomatic, a leiomyoma that undergoes necrosis, torsion or prolapse through the cervix may be associated with acute severe pain or bleeding. The imaging features of these and other important clinical entities in the female pelvis will be presented."

She was evaluated in our department and a heterotopic twin pregnancy in the tube was diagnosed by transvaginal sonography. Intrauterine pregnancy with positive fetal cardiac activity at 9 weeks of gestation according to crown-rump length measurement was detected. Laparotomy was carried out because of acute abdominal syndrome. Right ruptured tubal ectopic/heterotopic pregnancy and hemoperitoneum were diagnosed. Right salpingectomy was carried out.

    "abstract": "Bedside US has emerged as a valuable technology for the emergency department physician. It impacts clinical decision-making and the safety of procedures, and it decreases the time and increases the efficiency for completion of procedures. The portability, accuracy and noninvasive nature of US make it an ideal tool for the trained clinician. Bedside US can improve clinical decision-making for the pediatric patient by helping the clinician to identify critical pathology, direct therapeutic maneuvers and determine the futility of resuscitations. Many pediatric procedures, such as vascular access, lumbar puncture and bladder catheterization, are typically performed blindly. Bedside US enhances the success of procedures, minimizes complications and limits the number of attempts necessary to complete a procedure. Bedside US can be a valuable adjunct for complicated and time-sensitive disease processes such as ectopic pregnancy, testicular torsion and hypovolemia by providing information to guide diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that subsequently improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is the simultaneous existence of intrauterine and ectopic gestations. Heterotopic pregnancy is an extremely rare entity in natural cycle; however, it is increasing due to widespread use of assisted reproductive techniques. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in avoiding short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, early diagnosis is often difficult due to the presence of intrauterine pregnancy that impedes the diagnosis and early treatment for ectopic component. Clinical symptoms are not generally helpful in diagnosis, and signs of the ectopic pregnancy usually predominate. Patients will most likely present with abdominal pain, adnexial mass, enlarged uterus, peritoneal irritation signs, and a positive pregnancy test. We present a case, admitted to the emergency department, with atypical symptoms including acute left chest pain radiating to left shoulder, at 5 weeks' gestation."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is the gynaecological emergency par excellence and remains the leading cause of pregnancy-related first trimester deaths in the UK. Its prevalence continues to rise because of increases in the incidence of the risk factors predisposing to ectopic pregnancy. Classically, the diagnosis is based on a history of pelvic pain associated with amenorrhoea, a positive pregnancy test with or without slight vaginal bleeding. While the immediate differential diagnosis includes threatened or inevitable miscarriage, the likelihood of ectopic pregnancy is increased if transvaginal sonography (TVS) reveals an empty uterine cavity, and is confirmed if an adnexal mass with or without an embryo is seen. However, the diagnosis is often not that simple, especially when the patient presents early, has minimal pain, is haemodynamically stable, and TVS shows an empty uterus but no obvious adnexal mass. This could then be an early intrauterine pregnancy, or could indeed be an ectopic-a diagnosis of pregnancy of unknown location is made while additional investigations are made. The latter usually include serial measurements of serum beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) and repeat TVS. Changes in beta-hCG levels in normal, failing and ectopic pregnancy are now reasonably well characterised, and at early stages of presentation where the risk of rupture of an ectopic are minimal, the patient can often be managed as an outpatient while the diagnosis is pursued. In the patient who presents with pain and haemodynamic instability, the diagnosis is often obvious, and the management is immediate laparotomy. However, in modern gynaecological practice in the developed world the vast majority of ectopic pregnancies present early, and the general consensus is that laparoscopic management offers both economic and aesthetic advantages, and should be used whenever possible. Salpingectomy (excision of the fallopian tube containing the ectopic) is performed if the contra-lateral tube is healthy, while salpingotomy (linear incision made in the fallopian tube with removal of ectopic pregnancy and conservation of tube) is performed if the contra-lateral tube is unhealthy. Medical therapy using methotrexate given systemically or injected directly into the ectopic pregnancy is an option occasionally used with good results. There appear to be no major differences in subsequent fertility outcomes, or risk of recurrence of ectopic pregnancy, between the surgical or medical treatments. Although the rates of ectopic pregnancy are not falling in the developed world, mortality and morbidity are falling mainly due to early and improving diagnostic and treatment modalities. Mass screening and treatment of Chlamydia in the young, sexually active populations, and education regarding risk factors, may in future result in a reduction in the rates. Lack of resource mean that the picture may remain dismal for some time to come in the developing world, but the development of basic protocols, improved training and the infusion of basic resources may go a long way to improving the situation."

    "abstract": "The authors describe and discuss the clinical and therapeutic features of 40 ovarian torsions (OT) in children with its urgent treatment that has advanced in recent years. A retrospective study of 40 cases of OT in 38 children under 16 years of age, excluding adnexal torsions in neonates. Abdominal and/or pelvic pain was the presenting symptom ; 8 of these children had pain between 2 to 9 months prior to surgery and 27/40 (67.5%) had associated vomiting. Before the procedure, ultrasound (US) diagnosed 29 ovarian lesions, related to 14 mature teratomas (MTE) and 10 cystadenomas (CA), one association of MTE and CA in the same ovary, 2 functional cysts and 2 malignant neoplasms. 19/40 torsions could benefit from conservative management. Eleven torsions occurred, 10/11 of these ovaries had an increased volume, and 5/11 had US evidence of small subcortical cysts. Three detorsions with incomplete removal of CA were followed by enlargement of the tumor and re-torsion in 2 of them. Five children had bilateral ovarian pathology which led to unilateral ovariectomy, while the other benefited from conservative treatment. In any girl presenting with abdominal pain, the diagnosis of an ovarian torsion must be considered. US is performed emergently, but only surgery, most often a laparoscopic procedure, assures diagnosis. The treatment of the torsion is an emergency and must be as conservative as possible in order to preserve the ovarian function. Bilateral torsions are not unusual."

Sixty-seven patients who had MR of the lower abdomen and pelvis for acute abdomen were included in the study. The MR examinations were evaluated for indication of the study, type of MR sequences, and sensitivity of MR in diagnosing the disease. T2 single shot fast spin echo (SS-FSE), T2 FSE, short tau inversion recovery, pre-gadolinium T1, and post-gadolinium T1 sequences were utilized. There were 30 pregnant and two postpartum women in the study group. Positive pelvic MR findings were seen in 73% (49/67). Final diagnoses were acute appendicitis (n = 12), ovarian torsion (n = 6), abscess (n = 3), tubo-ovarian abscess (n = 2), ovarian tumor (n = 2), degenerating fibroid (n = 3), and perianal fistula (n = 2). For acute appendicitis, sensitivity was 100% (12/12), and positive predictive value was 92% (12/13). Post-gadolinium T1-weighted sequences and T2 SS-FSE with FS were the sequences, which were most likely to best demonstrate the acute appendicitis. For ovarian torsion, the sensitivity was 86% (6/7), and positive predictive value was 100% (6/6). MR imaging is an efficacious means of diagnosing acute appendicitis, ovarian torsions, and other adnexal diseases in the acute setting. The four sequence protocol without oral contrast offers an excellent means of investigating the cause of acute lower abdominal and pelvic pain."

Diagnostic 3-dimensional CT angiography and therapeutic emergency TAE. In all, 2952 patients (1165 laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy [LAVH], 1086 adnexal surgery, 417 laparoscopic-assisted myomectomy [LAM], 222 ectopic pregnancy surgery, and 62 other) were treated by laparoscopic surgery between January 1994 and October 2007. Fourteen patients developed postoperative hemorrhagic shock (5 LAVH [0.43%], 1 adnexal surgery [0.09%], 7 LAM [1.68%], 1 ectopic pregnancy surgery [0.45%]). Since 2004, instead of second laparotomy or laparoscopy, TAE was primarily chosen to manage the postoperative hemorrhage for 3 cases after LAVH and 6 cases after LAM. In 5 cases experienced in the last 2 years, diagnostic 3-dimensional CT angiography was performed to identify the bleeding artery before TAE. Transfusion of preoperatively donated autologous blood and intraoperatively salvaged autologous blood was sufficient to maintain vital functions of the patients except in 1 case of LAM that required homologous blood transfusion before TAE as a result of significant delay in establishing the diagnosis. Postembolization course was uneventful except in 1 case of LAVH that developed vaginal stump abscess and required transvaginal drainage twice after readmission. Emergency TAE is a safe and effective minimally invasive procedure for patients developing postoperative hemorrhage after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery.

Intraoperatively, the authors were surprised to encounter a right lateral wall rupture uterus and ~14 weeks foetus with the placenta lying freely in the peritoneal cavity. That was suggestive of a right interstitial ectopic which had grown up to 14 weeks, invaded the uterine cavity thus forming an angular ectopic, which ended up as the catastrophic event. The authors here wish to highlight that angular pregnancy is rare but it has catastrophic consequences including maternal mortality. Had the patient presented early, in view of history of previous ectopic, an ultrasonography and color Doppler would have been useful in early detection.

Treatment with systemic methotrexate was unsuccessful, and unilateral uterine artery embolization was performed followed by dilatation and curettage of the cervical canal. Three days after the procedure, sonographic examination showed contracted cervical canal. After a period of two months, normal uterine artery flow was registered by Doppler ultrasonography on both sides.

Single-dose methotrexate administration was administered twice. However, because of sudden upper abdominal pain with a drastic decline of hemoglobin, an emergent laparotomy was performed. The hematoma and a gestational sac were removed from the aorta and inferior vena cava. Ectopic pregnancy following IVF-ET in a patient with bilateral salpingectomy is likely to be the cause of implantation at this unusual site. An unusual ectopic pregnancy has a high risk of life-threatening massive bleeding.

Levonorgestrel, a synthetic gestagen, is recommended for emergency contraception as a single 1.5-mg dose or, alternatively, two 0.75-mg doses taken 12 h apart. Its efficacy is moderate, preventing about 80% of pregnancies. Efficacy is higher the earlier after unprotected intercourse the drug is taken, but it may be administered up to 5 days post-coitum. Tolerance is similar to, or better than, those of other oral emergency contraceptives. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, breast tenderness and transient alteration of menstrual bleeding pattern. It is not known whether levonogestrel increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy when the treatment fails. Its use as an ongoing contraceptive method is discouraged. When given before the preovulatory LH peak, levonorgestrel blocks or delays ovulation. It may also affect sperm migration in the female reproductive tract and have an effect on fertilization. Although it has been often postulated, there is no evidence for an anti-implantatory effect. Acquaintance with the method is quite variable among different societies, but it remains underutilized even where it is well known. Advance provision of the drug has been proposed as a way to promote its use. In clinical trials, advance provision did not adversely modify sexual or regular contraceptive behavior, but it did not reduce pregnancy or abortion rate either. Therefore, emergency contraception with levonorgestrel should be regarded as a backup method which is not a substitute for the continued use of more effective contraceptive methods."

Acute abdominal pain, massive vaginal bleeding, and impending shock occurred suddenly in this patient. In order to preserve her future fertility, we used a series of modified procedures, step-by-step, to minimize and control acute hemorrhaging, including transient ligation of the cervicovaginal branches of the uterine vessels with an 18-Fr Foley catheter, vasopressin use, resection of the ectopic pregnancy mass, compression using a 24-Fr Foley catheter, and finally, wound closure. Intraoperative blood loss was less than 400 mL. This treatment was successful, with resumption of normal menstrual cycles and a normal transvaginal ultrasonographic appearance of the cervical canal documented 3 months after the initial diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal and pelvic processes account for more than half of all surgical procedures performed in the emergency setting. Rapid and accurate diagnosis in the emergency department is essential for the appropriate management of these acute conditions. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an attractive modality for diagnostic imaging in patients for whom the risks of radiation or the potential nephrotoxicity of iodinated contrast agents is a major concern, such as pregnant and pediatric patients. MR imaging is most useful for evaluating pregnant patients with acute lower abdominal pain believed to have an extra-uterine cause, such as appendicitis or ovarian torsion. Other patients with other conditions commonly seen in the emergency setting may be better evaluated with another cross-sectional imaging modality. Imaging protocols should be adapted to the constraints of acute illness, with emphasis placed on minimizing the duration of image acquisition, and should include strategies to decrease motion-related artifacts. A prudent approach is to select the imaging modalities that can best depict a particular subset of clinical conditions to help narrow the differential diagnosis. Disadvantages of MR imaging include its high cost, the limited availability of MR imaging systems and trained radiologists, and the incompatibility of MR imaging systems and the equipment used for intensive care and monitoring of patient status."

A 40-year-old multigravida was diagnosed with coexisting extrauterine and intrauterine pregnancies when she presented with a right ectopic pregnancy in the emergency room. The patient underwent partial right salpingectomy and an elective abortion. Patients who present with acute pelvic pain must be investigated for coexisting ectopic pregnancy even though they have a proven intrauterine pregnancy. Such an investigation is even more important if the patient is undergoing assisted reproductive treatment. In patients who have had spontaneous or elective abortion, especially in cases of a gestation <4 weeks, the differential diagnosis should include coexisting ectopic pregnancy. Failure to diagnose this condition can have serious consequences."

    "title": "Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance features of gynecologic abnormalities in women presenting with acute or chronic abdominal pain.",
    "abstract": "Advances in technology and improved availability have led to increased use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate women presenting to the emergency department or to their primary care provider with abdominal and/or pelvic pain. Computed tomographic examinations are often performed to evaluate the presence of appendicitis or renal stone disease. However, gynecologic abnormalities are frequently identified on these examinations. Although ultrasound remains the primary modality by which complaints specific to the pelvis are evaluated, in many instances, CT and MRI imaging occurs before sonographic evaluation.Historically, because of cost, radiation exposure, and relative ease of use, ultrasound examinations have preceded all other imaging modalities when evaluating pelvic disorders. However, as CT and MRI technology have improved, their use in diagnosing causes of pelvic pain has become equal to that of ultrasound. In some cases, primarily because of historic comfort with sonographic evaluation, gynecologic abnormalities originally diagnosed on CT or MRI may be immediately and unnecessarily reevaluated by ultrasound. For a woman in her reproductive years, the most common adnexal masses are physiological cysts, endometriomas, and cystic teratomas. Although lesions are often asymptomatic and incidentally detected, they can present with pain, and they increase the risk of ovarian torsion. Common causes of chronic pelvic pain in this population include leiomyomata and adenomyosis. In postmenopausal women, ovarian carcinoma, which often does not present clinically until a late stage, has to be included in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. If a gynecologic pathology is discovered on CT or MRI, an immediate follow-up ultrasound need not be pursued if the lesion can be characterized as benign, needing immediate surgical intervention, or a variant of normal anatomy. If, on the other hand, findings demonstrate a mass that either is uncharacteristic of a benign lesion, has an indeterminate risk for malignancy, or demonstrates suspicious characteristics for malignancy (such as enhancing mural nodules), further evaluation by serial ultrasound, biochemical marker, and/or CT or MRI is warranted. The purpose of this review is to present a series of commonly encountered gynecologic abnormalities with either CT or MR to make radiologists more familiar with gynecologic pathology on CT and MRI."

    "abstract": "Most of the maternal death studies in this environment based their statistics on clinical cause with no reference to autopsy records. This gap of knowledge would be filled with autopsies performed on the victims. To highlight the importance of autopsy in the study of maternal mortality. A ten year (1st January 1991 - 31st December 2000) retrospective autopsy study of maternal deaths in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), Port Harcourt. The coroner's autopsy report and hospital autopsy records on maternal deaths were retrieved and re-evaluated for this study. Variables considered were the ages of the victims, primary place of antenatal care/management and the cause of death at autopsy. A total of 60 maternal autopsies were performed during the period under review. Forty eight (80%) cases were direct maternal deaths of which haemorrhagic shock from ruptured ectopic pregnancy was the most common 21(35%). The highest frequency of direct maternal death occurred in the age group 20 - 29 years. Indirect (fortuitous) maternal deaths accounted for 20% cases of which cardiovascular disorders was the most common cause of death 4(7.1%) and the age group 40-49 years were most affected 4(6.7%). Majority of the deaths occurred at the traditional birth attendants (TBA) centres 26(43.3%) of which 25(41.7%) were direct or obstetric maternal deaths. The indirect maternal death was highest in the general hospitals 4(6.7%). Maternal mortality is a common obstetric problem in this environment. As the death toll was highest in the TBA centers, they should be trained and be integrated to the health care delivery system. There should be an established referral system and improved emergency obstetric services including blood transfusion in our local health centres. These will drastically reduce the mortality rate."

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy using bedside transvaginal ultrasound (US) in an established emergency US program. This was a retrospective study on patients presenting over a 2-year period performed at a level I urban academic emergency department (ED). The ED sees 78,000 patients annually and has a residency and active US program. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were pregnant, seen in the ED for a first-trimester complication, and underwent a bedside emergency US suggesting an ectopic pregnancy. Emergency department US logs were reviewed for findings suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. Medical records were reviewed for history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, additional diagnostic testing, management, hospital course, and a discharge diagnosis by the admitting obstetric service (OB). Patients with incomplete data were excluded from analysis. Statistical analysis consisted of descriptive statistics. Seventy-four patients ranging in age from 16 to 39 years (mean, 25 years) were included in the study. Eight patients with incomplete data were excluded from analysis. Emergency-physician US diagnoses included definite ectopic pregnancy (6/74), probable ectopic pregnancy (28/74), and possible ectopic pregnancy (40/74). Forty-seven (64%) of these patients were eventually diagnosed with definite ectopic pregnancy by the OB. During initial consultation, the OB disagreed with the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in 15 (32%) of the 47 eventual patients with ectopic pregnancy, calling them miscarriages. Other eventual diagnoses included 9 (12%) patients with possible ectopic pregnancy, 11 (14%) patients with miscarriage, and 7 (9%) with intrauterine pregnancy. Emergency sonologists found tubal rings in 9 (19%) patients with eventual ectopic pregnancy, complex adnexal mass in 29 (61%) patients, and a large amount of echogenic fluid in the cul-de-sac in 10 (21%) patients. Six (13%) patients had live ectopic pregnancy. The OB ordered a radiology US in 10 cases but did not change the diagnosis or management. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels ranged from 41 to 59846 mIU/mL (mean, 4602 mIU/mL), but for live ectopic pregnancy, the range was 2118 to 59,846 mIU/mL (mean, 36,341 mIU/mL). Seventeen (36%) patients had beta-hCG levels of lower than 1000 mIU/mL. Of 47 eventual ectopic pregnancies, 29 (62%) patients underwent operative intervention, 17 (36%) patients received methotrexate, and 1 patient left against medical advice. Five (11%) of these patients with definite ectopic pregnancy were initially managed by emergency physicians with follow-up ED visits and serial US examinations without OB consultation. Our study demonstrates that with increased experience, emergency sonologists can accurately diagnose ectopic pregnancy. Furthermore, patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy should not be denied US examinations if their beta-hCG levels fall below an arbitrary discriminatory zone."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy is the most important cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the first trimester. Over the past few decades, the management of ectopic pregnancy has been revolutionized; various modalities of treatment are currently in practice. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency ofthese modes of treatment of ectopic pregnancy and their outcome. Fifty two patients diagnosed to have ectopic pregnancy at MCH Center unit II in the year 2004 and 2005 were included in the study. A cross-sectional analytical study was done. Four modes of treatment were given according to patient's condition, ultrasound findings and beta-hCG levels; these were laparotomy, operative laparoscopy, methotrexate injection and conservative management. The outcome measures included success of each treatment modality, need for second mode of treatment in each group and duration of hospital stay. A total number of 52 patients with ectopic pregnancy were identified and studied. The rate of ectopic pregnancy was 1:100 deliveries. Emergency laparotomy was performed in 30 (57.9%) women, 15 (28.8%) received methotrexate injection. Seven women (13.3%) were managed conservatively and operative laparoscopy was not used as primary treatment in any of the patient. All cases of laparotomy did not require any further procedure. Twelve out of fifteen (80%) cases of medical treatment were successful while one (6.7%) proceeded to emergency laparotomy, one (6.7%) to operative laparoscopy and one (6.7%) to laparoscopy preceding laparotomy. Five out of seven patients (71.4%) on conservative treatment did not require any further intervention while two (28.6%) of them resolved with methotrexate injection. The duration of hospital stay in laparotomy, medically treated and conservatively managed groups was 6.5, 5.9 and 1.7 days respectively. In the institutional setting ectopic pregnancy accounted for 1% of total deliveries. More than half of all women with ectopic pregnancy presented with acute abdomen and required emergency laparotomy. About 40% women could be managed with non-surgical modalities with 80% success for methotrexate injection and 71% for conservative treatment in the present study."

Data were extracted and analyzed for all patients ultimately diagnosed with EP. Patients were separated into adult (> or =20 years of age) and adolescent groups (<20 years of age). Adjusted comparisons were made between these two groups regarding pain, vaginal bleeding, current and past pelvic infections, prior pregnancy history, and prior surgery using Pearson's chi-square, t test, and multivariable models. The incidence of EP was lower in the adolescent group versus the adult group (9.7% versus 21.7%). Classical risk factors such as prior EP (P < 0.01), and prior pelvic surgery (P < 0.01) were significantly more likely to be associated with adults than adolescents with EP. Adolescent patients were significantly more likely to present with abdominal pain (P = 0.045) and current gonorrhea and/or chlamydia (gc/ct) infection (P < 0.01). This preliminary study suggests that different risk factors may be associated with EP in adolescents compared to adults."

To prospectively determine if emergency physician (EP)-performed transabdominal pelvic ultrasonography (US) with determination of free abdominal fluid in the hepatorenal space predicted the need for operative intervention. Patients who were suspected to have an ectopic pregnancy were prospectively enrolled over a ten-month period. An EP-performed bedside transabdominal pelvic US that included a view of the hepatorenal space (Morison's pouch) for free fluid. The EP US was classified as intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) or no definitive IUP, with Morison's pouch classified as positive or negative. The majority of patients had a subsequent transvaginal pelvic US performed by the Department of Radiology. Patients were followed up for radiology results, need for operative intervention, and ultimate outcome of the pregnancy. There were 242 patients enrolled, with an average time to complete the EP US of 4 minutes and 27 seconds. There were 28 ectopic pregnancies diagnosed (11.6%), of which 18 patients underwent operative intervention. Free fluid in Morison's pouch was identified in ten patients, nine of whom underwent operative intervention, yielding a positive likelihood ratio of 112 (95% confidence interval = 15 to 831) for patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy who required operative intervention. Free intraperitoneal fluid found in Morison's pouch in patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy may be rapidly identified at the bedside by EP-performed US and predicts the need for operative intervention."

    "abstract": "Hemoperitoneum may occur in various emergent conditions. In the trauma setting, evidence of intraperitoneal blood depicted at computed tomography (CT) should lead the radiologist to conduct a careful search of images for the injured visceral organ (the liver or spleen). Specific CT signs, such as a sentinel clot or extravasation of intravascular contrast material, may indicate the source of bleeding and help direct management. In addition, the configuration of accumulated blood may help identify the injured organ; for example, triangular fluid collections are observed in the mesentery most often in the setting of bowel or mesenteric injury. Less commonly, hemoperitoneum may have a nontraumatic origin. Iatrogenic hemoperitoneum may occur as a complication of surgery or other interventional procedures in the abdominal cavity or as a result of anticoagulation therapy. Hemoperitoneum also may be seen in the setting of blood dyscrasias such as hemophilia and polycythemia vera. Tumor-associated hemorrhage, which most often occurs in hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, or vascular metastatic disease, also may produce hemoperitoneum. Other potential causes of nontraumatic hemoperitoneum are gynecologic conditions such as hemorrhage or rupture of an ovarian cyst and rupture of the gestational sac in ectopic pregnancy, and hepatic hematoma in syndromic hemolysis with elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome). Vascular lesions (visceral artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms) that occur in systemic vascular diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or in pancreatitis are another less common source of hemoperitoneum."

Whether diagnosed early or not, it may cause maternal mortality or morbidity during emergency management. Life-saving emergency hysterectomy is usually the treatment of choice when there is profuse bleeding intraoperatively or after initial management. A 38-year-old woman with a history of two previous cesarean deliveries was referred to our clinic under the impression of CSP at 11 weeks' gestation. A viable embryo with a crown-rump length of 4.8 cm in the anterior wall of the uterus at the cervico-isthmic region was detected. Under the confirmation of CSP via ultrasonography, she was admitted for management. During hysterotomy, profuse bleeding with 1,000 mL blood loss was noted. After conservative procedure for hemostasis, however, massive vaginal bleeding persisted. As a result, we immediately transferred the patient to receive transarterial embolization (TAE) for bleeding control. The patient was discharged 4 days after the operation and TAE and her period resumed 1 month later. Management of CSP is usually accompanied by profuse blood loss. Hysterectomy is inevitable if massive blood loss occurs during surgical intervention. For preservation of fertility and avoidance of mortality, our physicians offered an alternative life-saving policy even under catastrophic blood loss."

However, a chronic ovarian torsion with entire necrosis may be an exceptional mimicker. We herein present an unusual case of painless ovarian torsion similar to a subserous uterine myoma. A 35-year-old female virgin presented with a palpable midline pelvic mass that had been present for 2 months. Ultrasound revealed a well-defined, heterogeneous solid mass with echogenic rim that resembled a uterine myoma, 10.9 x 9.9 x 7.3 cm in size, just upon the uterus. Surgical exploration disclosed an enlarged stony ovary and swollen tube that were both twisted. The ovary was clogged up with red meat-like necrotic tissue. The pathologic findings were compatible with ovarian torsion, and subsequent infarction and necrosis. Ovarian torsion is a significant cause of acute lower abdominal pain in women and is a gynecologic surgical emergency. Nevertheless, surgical strategies are usually impeded because of ambiguous warning signs. Clinicians may be misled by certain conditions such as silent ovarian torsion. Although there may be no specific indication, the diagnosis of ovarian torsion should be considered on finding a pelvic mass."

Detailed management will not be discussed in this review. However, risk factors for tubal ectopic pregnancy, ultrasound diagnosis and the benefits of early pregnancy units will be discussed. All women in the reproductive age group who present to a general practitioner or hospital emergency department with lower abdominal pain, with or without vaginal bleeding, have an ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. A urinary pregnancy test is mandatory in this clinical situation and if positive, these women should then have a transvaginal--not transabdominal--ultrasound scan (TVS) performed. The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy should be based on the positive visualisation of an adnexal mass using TVS rather than on the basis of a scan that fails to demonstrate an intrauterine gestational sac. Diagnosing the condition earlier in its natural history using TVS has changed management options and reduced the associated mortality, with collapse and subsequent emergency laparotomy being the exception rather than the rule in modern practice. Early pregnancy units have been shown to benefit women with early pregnancy complications, reduce unnecessary admissions, reduce costs and are an effective use of resources."

Due to advancements in diagnostic technology it is possible to diagnose this condition early and thus try to achieve a favourable outcome for the patient. Treatment options in the form of medical and surgical modalities are widely available. As minimally invasive therapy techniques are rapidly advancing, laparoscopic treatment has become the most popular and preferred method for treating ectopic pregnancy. Both salpingotomy as well as salpingectomy can be performed through the laparoscope.

The main research questions were: what educational topics would rural and remote doctors prefer to learn about in intermediate obstetric ultrasound and emergency medicine ultrasound, and what were those doctors' preferred methods of delivery for an ultrasound education program. A self-administered postal questionnaire containing a pre-paid return envelope was mailed to 344 Australian rural and remote doctors in December 2003. 107 completed questionnaires were returned, giving a response rate of 32.7%. This was after the denominator was adjusted for the 17 doctors whose letters were returned to sender. The respondents included 23 (21.5%) female and 84 (78.5%) male doctors. Eighty doctors (74.8%) stated that they used ultrasound, and 27 (25.2%) said they did not. Seventy-seven (72%) indicated they had previously participated in some ultrasound education and training. The respondents stated that their main areas of educational need in intermediate obstetric ultrasound were ectopic pregnancy (76.6%), miscarriage (72%), intrauterine growth restriction (65.4%), transvaginal scanning (47.7%), detecting fetal abnormalities (47.7%) and morphology scanning at 18-20 weeks (41.1%). The main areas of educational need in emergency medicine ultrasound were focused abdominal sonography in trauma (63.5%), detecting foreign bodies (40.2%), gynecological ultrasound (39.2%), gall bladder and biliary tract (37.4%), abdominal aortic aneurysm (32.7%) and trauma bleeding (31.7%). Australian rural and remote doctors are using ultrasound technology to improve the clinical investigation and diagnosis of a large variety of clinical conditions in their family medical practices. This paper describes the results of research into the educational needs of this target group of doctors."

    "abstract": "During the past 25 years, the incidence of ectopic pregnancy has progressively increased while the morbidity and mortality have substantialy decreased, and the treatment has progressed from salpingectomy by laparotomy to conservative surgery by laparoscopy and more recently to medical therapy with Methotrexate or expectant management. This therapeutic transition from surgical emergency to non surgical managment has been attributed to early diagnosis through the use of sensitive assays for hCG and the high definition of vaginal ultrasound. By using these sensitive diagnostic tools, we are now able to select those patients who are most likely to respond to expectant or medical managment versus those who are at high risk of rupture and require surgery. We have reviewed the scientific literature on ectopic pregnancy published over the past 20 years, with the aim to assess the value of non surgical managment of etopic pregnancy. Predictor factors of expectant managment are discussed. Medical therapy with methotrexate: results, indications, Unpleasant side effects and complications are detailed. Several protocols are defined and therapeutic supervision is etablished. The authors offred several recommandations for OB/GY wich will optimize the effectivness of non invasive methods for treatment of ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "To evaluate patient satisfaction with the follitropin alfa prefilled pen (Gonal-f RFF Pen), compared with previously used injectable gonadotropins (vial/ampoules and syringe), in women undergoing ovulation induction (OI). Women aged 18-40 years undergoing OI for oligoanovulatory infertility were enrolled from nine US fertility centers in this prospective, open-label clinical trial. Participants received recombinant follitropin alfa using a prefilled pen. Patient satisfaction was determined using a pre-treatment questionnaire to assess gonadotropin treatments undertaken within 6 months of study initiation and an in-treatment questionnaire to assess satisfaction with the prefilled pen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who preferred the prefilled pen compared to previous injectable gonadotropin therapies. Efficacy and safety were also assessed. Seventy-three subjects were screened for the study; 62 enrolled, were treated with the follitropin alfa pre-filled pen, and 61 completed the in-treatment questionnaire. Sixty-one of 61 patients who stated a preference preferred the prefilled pen to previous injectable gonadotropin therapies (61/61; 100%; 95% confidence interval: [94.1-100.0%]). One patient did not state a preference. Of these 61 patients, 54 (89%) found that the prefilled pen instructions were easy to understand compared to 17 of 59 (29%) who thought instructions for the conventional syringes were easy to understand. When preparing their dose, significantly fewer patients contacted their healthcare provider two or more times during the treatment cycle when receiving treatment with the prefilled pen (2/61, 3%) than during the first treatment cycle with prior gonadotropin treatment, 11/59 (19%, p = 0.007). The pen interfered slightly or not at all with patients' normal daily activities in 61 of 61 patients (100%) versus 50 of 59 patients (85%) who had this opinion regarding injections during their prior treatment cycles (p = 0.003). All 61 patients who stated a method of injection preference found the prefilled pen less stressful to use than syringes and would recommend the pen to another woman considering gonadotropin treatment. A total of 10/62 (16%) subjects reported 18 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). Two cases of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurred post-treatment and one serious AE occurred (post-treatment ectopic pregnancy). Injection site reactions were generally mild to moderate, with mild itching (6 patients, 9.7%) and moderate redness in one patient. Fifteen patients reported mild redness (24.2%). Mild bruising (21.0%), mild pain (33.9%), and mild burning (32.3%) were also reported by patients. Seven patients (11.3%) had moderate pain. In this open-label, non-comparative study, patients undergoing OI preferred administering gonadotropins using the follitropin alfa prefilled pen compared to their prior use of vials/ampoules and a syringe. Patients using the prefilled pen found it less stressful, easier to use and more convenient than a conventional syringe and would recommend the pen to another woman considering gonadotropin treatment."

    "abstract": "The heterotopic pregnancy is a combination of an intra-uterine and extra-uterine pregnancy, at the same time. The spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy is a rare illness with an estimated frequency below one per 20,000 and one per 30,000. The first case was reported in France by Duverney in 1708 during an autopsy. The frequency of this pregnancy has increased with the implementation of assisted reproduction techniques. This paper is the report of a case of spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy seen at the Angeles Mexico Hospital. A 32 year old woman, gravida 1; dilatation and curettage was performed on 13th February because of a blighted ovum, a lot of products of conception were obtained. The patient was discharged the next day only with analgesics. She returns to the emergency room on February 16th with hypovolemic shock and acute abdomen. A normocitic normocromic anemia was found on the hematic biometry, the transvaginal ultrasound reported amount of blood in the cul-de-sac, echogenic adnexal mass, suggesting a gestational sac with embryo. An emergency laparotomy was used to perform a left cornual resection; the findings were 600 cc of hemoperitoneum and a left ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She had an uneventful postoperative course, and was discharged 72 hours later without complications. Heterotopic pregnancy is a rare illness and must always be considered for the increase in pregnancy related with assisted reproduction techniques, although, it should be considered in a spontaneous pregnancy too."

    "abstract": "Transcatheter arterial embolization has become a major treatment modality in a variety of clinical applications, including management of bleeding related to a broad spectrum of obstetric and gynecologic disorders. Embolotherapy has a well-documented role in the management of pelvic and genital tract hemorrhage in the postpartum and postoperative/postcesarean setting. It is also an integral part in the treatment armamentarium of abdominal and cervical ectopic pregnancy, arteriovenous malformation, and gynecologic neoplasms, including more recently, uterine leiomyomata. Based on experiences accumulated over the past decades, embolotherapy has been proven to be highly effective with success rate in the 90 to 100% range in the appropriate clinical settings. It provides visualization of the bleeding site and enables targeted, minimally invasive therapy to achieve hemostasis, which allows preservation of the uterus and hence fertility. In hospitals where experienced personnel and technology is available, transcatheter arterial embolization should be considered in the emergent management of obstetric and gynecologic hemorrhage, particularly when local and conservative measures fail to attain hemostasis."

However, adnexal torsion should be considered in premenarcheal girls admitted with acute abdominal pain and evidence of an ovarian mass. Accurate and early radiological diagnosis is mandatory immediately after onset of clinical symptoms in order to preserve the viability of the ovary. Ultrasound (US) is usually the first line examination performed in an emergency setting, but computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in case of ambiguous US findings, especially in patients with sub-acute symptoms and a suspected adnexal mass.

A total of 152 subjects were studied. Of these, 15 (9.9%) of the women had ruptured ectopic pregnancy while the rest had other causes of bleeding in early pregnancy. The mean shock index for ruptured ectopic pregnancy was significantly different from that for threatened abortion (p < 0.001), incomplete abortion (p = 0.022) and inevitable abortion (p < 0.001) but not from that for unruptured ectopic pregnancy and septic abortion (p > 0.05 for both categories). The areas under the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves for shock index and heart rate were statistically significant (p < 0.001 for both variables) but those under the curves for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure were not statistically significant (p > 0.05 for the three variables). From the curves, the cut-offs that combined highest sensitivity with lowest false positivity (1-specificity) were 0.935 for the shock index and 99 bpm for heart rate. On univariate logistic regression, the odds ratio (OR) for predicting ruptured ectopic pregnancy was 52.9 (95% CI = 10.9 - 257.3, p < 0.001) for shock index > or =0.935 and 26.4 (95% CI = 6.8 - 102.8, p < 0.001) for heart rate > or =99/min. On multivariate logistic regression using both shock index > or =0.935 and heart rate > or =99/min, only shock index > or =0.935 was statistically significant with an OR of 4.5 (95% CI = 1.8 - 11.6, p = 0.002). We conclude that when faced with the possibility of ruptured ectopic pregnancy, shock index has a high predictive value in the Nigerian population studied and is a useful addition to the currently available diagnostic armamentarium in ruptured ectopic pregnancy."

The mean pretreatment level of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) was 2209 +/- 1381 mIU/ml. Only 22 women (73.3%) were successfully treated with a single dose of MXT. Five women required a second injection, and one woman required a third dose. The combined success rate for medical management of ectopic pregnancy with 1-3 doses of MXT was 86.7% (26 women). Pretreatment beta-hCG levels were significantly lower in women who responded to single dose therapy than in those who required either multiple doses or who had failure of medical management (p<0.001). The mean time to resolution of beta-hCG was 32.5 +/- 17 days. Higher pretreatment levels correlated with longer resolution time (p<0.001). Four women (13.3%) had a failure of medical management and required surgery. In our series, MXT was successful in 26 women (86.7%). Women with a pretreatment beta-hCG level of 3000-4000 mIU/ml had a greater probability of requiring either surgical intervention or multiple doses of MXT. The potential for emergency surgery remains an important risk."

Ectopic pregnancy (EP), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and miscarriages are common gynaecological emergencies and early recognition and appropriate treatment is essential to avoid unwanted sequelae. Controversy will always exist in clinical medicine because management is mainly based on uncontrolled studies, expert opinion and personal experiences. It is estimated that only 10% of clinical treatments have been validated by prospective, randomised trials. Recent advances have led to earlier diagnosis and more conservative treatment on an outpatient or day care basis in EP and miscarriages."

    "abstract": "The initial assessment of acute gynecology patients is usually based on history and clinical examination and does not involve ultrasound. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the availability of transvaginal sonography at the time of initial assessment of the emergency gynecology patient. This was a prospective observational study carried out over a 5-month period in the acute gynecology unit of an inner London teaching hospital. Women were assessed in the routine manner by history-taking and clinical examination and questionnaires were completed by the doctors, including details of the intention to treat. Transvaginal ultrasound examinations were then performed and a second diagnosis and management plan were made utilizing the extra information from the scan. The plans for clinical management before and after the ultrasound examination were compared. We originally recruited 1000 consecutive women to the study. The mean age was 31.1 (SD, 9.81) years. Complete data were available for 920 (92%). 84 (9.1%) women did not require a scan. Of the 521 women with a positive pregnancy test, 75.6% were reassured immediately that their pregnancy was intrauterine. 143 women (27.4%) were given the diagnosis of a suspected ectopic pregnancy before sonography, compared with 29 (5.6%) after. Following the ultrasound examination there was a change in clinical management in 54.1% of the women with a positive pregnancy test and a reduction in admissions (including inpatient theater admissions) (from 40.3% to 17.1%) and outpatient follow-up examinations (from 41.1% to 35.5%). In 90 (23.8%) non-pregnant women a significant ovarian cyst (> 5 cm) was suspected clinically; 28/90 (31.1%) were confirmed on sonography. Following the ultrasound examination there was a change in clinical management for 38.1% of non-pregnant women and a reduction in admissions (from 37.1% to 19.4%) and outpatient follow-up examinations (from 25.7% to 18.1%). It appears that the availability of transvaginal sonography at the time of initial assessment of emergency gynecology patients improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces unnecessary admissions and follow-up examinations."

To determine the treatment success rate with a single-dose intravenous methotrexate/folinic acid regimen and to identify predictors of treatment outcome. A 5-year audit (April 2000-August 2005) was carried out, collecting clinical imaging data and serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG). Time taken for complete beta-hCG resolution was recorded, and a negative beta-hCG result was used as an endpoint of successful outcome. Of the 13 cases, two required urgent surgery for rupture on presentation. In the remaining 11 cases, intravenous methotrexate (300 mg) was used, with oral folinic acid rescue (15 mg x 4 doses). There were no side-effects. Complete beta-hCG resolution was achieved in 10 of the 11 medically treated cases (91% success rate), requiring 21-129 days. Successful outcome was seen with initial beta-hCG level as high as 106 634 IU/L and gestation sac as large as 6 cm and a live fetus. The methotrexate/folinic acid regimen used as a one-dose treatment is safe and effective for unruptured interstitial pregnancy, with no side-effects and the advantage of avoiding invasive surgery.

The spectrum of disease ranges from subclinical, asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening illness; sequelae include chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. PID is diagnosed clinically, with laboratory and imaging studies reserved for patients who have an uncertain diagnosis, are severely ill, or do not respond to initial therapy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria include uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness with no other obvious cause in women at risk of PID. Empiric treatment should be initiated promptly and must cover Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; the possibility of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae also should be considered. Hospitalization for initial parenteral therapy is necessary for patients with tubo-ovarian abscess and for those who are pregnant, severely ill, unable to follow a prescribed treatment plan, or unable to tolerate oral antibiotics. Patients also should be hospitalized if a surgical emergency cannot be excluded or if no clinical improvement occurs after three days.

Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were obtained over time until definitive diagnosis. To be included, women had to have at least 2 hCG measurements. Human chorionic gonadotropin curves were characterized and their slopes calculated. Two hundred women received diagnoses of ectopic pregnancy with the help of serial hCG values and were included in the study. No curve adequately characterized the pattern of hCG values so attention was focused on the initial 2 values. The median slope of log hCG among all subjects was 0.11 (25% increase in 2 days). However, 60% of subjects had an initial rise in hCG, and 40% had an initial fall. The rise in hCG for women with ectopic pregnancies (0.28; 75% increase in 2 days) was slower than the mean increase reported for a viable intrauterine pregnancy. The decline in hCG for women with ectopic pregnancies (-0.225; 27% decline in 2 days) was slower than the mean reported for completed spontaneous abortion. However, 20.8% of women presented with a rise in hCG values similar to the minimal rise for women with a viable gestation, and 8% of women presented with a fall in hCG values similar to women with a completed spontaneous abortion. There is no single way to characterize the pattern of hCG for ectopic pregnancy. The number of women with ectopic pregnancy who experience an increase in hCG values is approximately equal to the number of those who experience a decrease. The hCG profile in women with ectopic pregnancy can mimic that of an intrauterine pregnancy or a completed spontaneous abortion in approximately 29% of cases. II-2."

Further, a decision may need to be made regarding emergent surgical intervention or blood transfusion vs. aggressive fluid resuscitation or pressors followed by other testing such as computed tomography. This case series illustrates the utility of an ultrasound guided, emergent diagnostic paracentesis in the management of unstable patients found to have a positive FAST examination. Six unstable patients were evaluated with the FAST examination and found to have large quantities of intraperitoneal fluid.

Despite most advanced strategies for early detection, emergency situations caused by ectopic pregnancies still happen. Ectopic pregnancies are most frequently located in the fallopian tubes. Tubal abortion and tubal rupture are very demanding situations in the course of a tubal pregnancy that need immediate assessment and treatment, and maybe emergency life support. Of all the different types of abortion, incomplete abortion is most likely to provoke life-threatening situations. Incomplete expulsion of the products of conception may lead to severe bleeding from the uterus. Immediate uterine curettage is required in this case.

Four hundred six (47.2%) of 860 total callers and 277 (64.4%) of 430 privately insured callers were offered appointments within a week. Callers who claimed to have private insurance were more likely to receive appointments than those who claimed to have Medicaid coverage (63.6% [147/231] vs 34.2% [79/231]; difference, 29.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 21.2-37.6; P<.001). Callers reporting private insurance coverage had higher appointment rates than callers who reported that they were uninsured but offered to pay 20 dollars and arrange payment of the balance (65.3% [130/199] vs 25.1% [50/199]; difference, 40.2; 95% confidence interval, 31.4-49.1; P<.001). There were no differences in appointment rates between callers who claimed to have private insurance coverage and those who reportedly were uninsured but willing to pay cash for the entire visit fee (66.3% [132/199] vs 62.8% [125/199]; difference, 3.5; 95% confidence interval -3.7 to 10.8; P = .31). The median charge was 100 dollars (range, 25 dollars-600 dollars). Seventy-two percent of clinics did not attempt to determine the severity of the caller's condition. Reported insurance status is associated with access to timely follow-up ambulatory care for potentially serious conditions. Having private insurance and being willing to pay cash may not eliminate the difficulty in obtaining urgent follow-up appointments."

    "abstract": "Primary ovarian pregnancy is a relatively rare form of ectopic pregnancy with an incidence of 1/6000 - 1/40000 pregnancies. A 25-year-old woman, gravida 1, parity 0, presented with vaginal bleeding after 8 weeks of amenorrhea. Pelvic examination revealed a left adnexal mass and transvaginal ultrasound confirmed a left adnexal echocomplex mass with free fluid in the cul-de-sac. Serum beta hCG was 3441 mIU/mL. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed with a preoperative diagnosis of left ectopic pregnancy, suspected of ovarian pregnancy. Ruptured left ovarian pregnancy was intraoperatively diagnosed. Left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The histopathology confirmed ovarian pregnancy. She was well at discharge and throughout a 4-week period of follow-up. Although primary ovarian pregnancy is rare and difficult to diagnose clinically and even intraoperatively, it can be detected early with the use of combined transvaginal ultrasonography and serum beta hCG The standard of care is conservative treatment in order to preserve the patient's fertility."

    "abstract": "Since the last decade the Yolk sac (YS) has been a topic of increasing interest due to the growing use of high-resolution sonography in early determination of pregnancy. Human YS shape and diameter are indicators of viability of pregnancy during the early embryonic period. Nevertheless, the major interest concerns the vital function it plays in early embryo growth and development. Two compartments are recognized in this organ: the yolk sac proper and the vitelline stalk. In this study we report the identification and partial characterization of a glomus-like body in the wall of the secondary YS in humans. A detailed structural description is also presented on the time course of formation of this new structure, at precisely sequential stages between 4-8 wk post-conception. The significance of this new compartment on the YS function is analyzed. Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate the microstructure of the YS and the vitelline stalk during the first 8 wk of development. Ten YSs were collected from embryos (aged between 24-50 days) obtained from emergency salpingectomies due to tubal ectopic pregnancy. From 5 wk onward a new structure was observed in the YS located near the apex of the pear-shaped yolk vesicle and closed to the connecting stalk. We designate this differentiation as glomus-like body. This structure is 1-1.5 mm long and merged from a pocket-like structure of the extraembryonic splanchnic mesoderm of the YS wall. It likely represents an area of convergence of the vascular network of the YS wall. Our findings underline the remarkable complexity of the human secondary yolk sac during early development. The detailed description of the microanatomy of this vital organ is of theoretical and practical interest in order to unravel the mechanisms used by the yolk sac to transport nutrients to the embryo."

Twenty-five exposed newborns with length and weight identical to that of the control group were shown to be without increased risk of congenital malformation. No statistical differences were observed in terms of spontaneous or legal abortion and pregnancy and neonatal complications, and there was no ectopic pregnancy in either group. Although the sample size was small, in our experience, the failure of levonorgestrel as an emergency contraceptive was not associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, prepartum or peripartum complications, or an adverse pregnancy outcome."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyze pitfalls in the diagnosis and treatment of congenital paraesophageal hiatal hernia (PEHH). Between 1992 and 2004, the records of 5 infants with PEHH were retrospectively reviewed for age, sex, presenting symptoms, radiological studies, operative findings and approaches, and outcomes. All cases (3 male, 2 female) had right-sided hernias. They had clinical features of recurrent chest infections and intermittent vomiting that were present since birth in 3. Three presented acutely ill with findings of respiratory distress and vomiting. Three were referred with misdiagnoses of reflux disease, thoracic mass, and bronchopneumonia. On the chest x-rays of 3 cases, there were paracardiac opacities suggesting a mass lesion. According to the upper gastrointestinal series and/or computed tomography findings, 4 cases had a combination of sliding and paraesophageal hernia, and the remainder one had pure rolling hiatus hernia. Three had obstruction owing to organoaxial volvulus and required an emergency operation. All cases had a large hernia orifice. Four had gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) displaced into the thorax, and in 3, the stomach was found to be twisted, and transverse colon with omentum was also in the thorax in 2. In the remainder, the GEJ was in its normal position with herniated stomach. None of the cases had normal gastrosplenic and gastrocolic ligaments. Surgical repair included resection of the sac, closure of the hiatal defect, and Thal procedure. Two had intestinal malrotation, with right ovarian torsion and ventricular septal defect, respectively. Postoperative ventilation was required in one who later died. At a mean follow-up of 2 years, the other 4 had no symptoms related to the disease, and no evidence of recurrence or reflux was noted on control upper gastrointestinal series. Congenital PEHH may be difficult to diagnose. It is frequently complicated and associated with morbidity and even mortality. If the defect is large and associated with displacement of GEJ into the thorax, adding an antireflux procedure to the repair is appropriate."

We reviewed the medical records of all children with acute ovarian torsion treated at a university-affiliated pediatric hospital from 1987 to 2002; prenatal cases were excluded. For each child we recorded the time from onset of symptoms to initial examination and the time from initial examination to operation. We reviewed diagnostic tests used, operative reports, and pathology reports. We identified 22 cases; the mean age was 10.2 years (range, 3-15 years). In 6 cases (27%), the ovary was salvaged. Prolonged duration of symptoms prior to initial examination was not significantly associated with ovarian necrosis. Mean time of symptoms prior to care was 76 hours for both salvaged and nonsalvaged ovaries (range, 7-159 hours). The mean time from initial examination to operation, 11 hours for salvaged ovaries (range, 1-23 hours) and 21 hours for nonsalvaged ovaries (range, 2-71 hours), was not significantly different between groups. Twenty-one patients underwent imaging; 19 of 20 ultrasounds and 4 of 5 computed tomographic scans suggested the diagnosis. Less than half (10 of 22) of the torsed ovaries contained cysts, teratomas, or other masses. These data suggest pediatric ovarian torsion is a more salvageable condition than previously reported. Prolonged time of symptoms prior to initial examination does not preclude ovarian salvage. Ovarian tumor accounts for less than half of cases. Urgent imaging and surgical management may lead to improved outcomes."

    "abstract": "First trimester bleeding is a common presentation in the emergency room. Ultrasound evaluation of patients with first trimester bleeding is the mainstay of the examination. The important causes of first trimester bleeding include spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and gestational trophoblastic disease; 50% to 70% of spontaneous abortions are due to genetic abnormalities. In normal pregnancy, the serum beta hCG doubles or increases by at least 66% in 48 hours. The intrauterine GS should be visualized by TVUS with beta hCG levels between 1000 to 2000 mIU/mL IRP. Visualization of the yolk sac within the gestational sac is definitive evidence of intrauterine pregnancy. Embryonic cardiac activity can be identified with CRL of >5 mm. A GS with a mean sac diameter (MSD) of 8 mm or more without a yolk sac and a GS with an MSD of 16 mm or more without an embryo, are important predictors of a nonviable gestation. A GS with a mean sac diameter of 16 mm or more (TVUS) without an embryo is a sonographic sign of anembryonic gestation. A difference of <5 mm between the mean sac diameter and the CRL carries an 80% risk of spontaneous abortion. Approximately 20% of women with first trimester bleeding have a subchorionic hematoma. The presence of an extra ovarian adnexal mass is the most common sonographic finding in ectopic pregnancy. Other findings include the tubal ring sign and hemorrhage. About 26% of ectopic pregnancies have normal pelvic sonograms on TVUS. Complete hydatidiform mole presents with a complex intrauterine mass with multiple anechoic areas of varying sizes (Snowstorm appearance). Twenty-five percent to 65% of molar pregnancies have associated theca-leutin cysts. Arteriovenous malformation of the uterus is a rare but life-threatening cause of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester. The sonographic findings in a patient with first trimester bleeding should be correlated with serum beta hCG levels to arrive at an appropriate clinical diagnosis."

This was a retrospective study of all pelvic sonographic examinations on patients with first-trimester complications seen over an 18-month period at a large urban emergency department. All pregnant patients with signs or symptoms of concern for ectopic pregnancy were scanned to evaluate for intrauterine pregnancy. Masses suggestive of either a corpus luteum or an ectopic pregnancy were separated from the ovary with abdominal palpation and endovaginal transducer movement. The ultrasound director and assistant director reviewed videos of all scans. Results of mass separation and outcome were recorded. Independent movement of a mass and ovary was defined as movement of the mass away from the ovary, sliding past the ovary or rotation past the ovary. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, inter-rater reliability, the Fisher exact test, and sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values. A total of 78 patient scans fit the criteria, and in 27 of them, the mass separated from the ovary. Twenty-three patients had ectopic pregnancy as the final diagnosis, and in 2 of these, no independent mass movement occurred. Lack of independent movement of the mass and ovary was significantly more common in patients without a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (P < .0001). The negative predictive value was 96.1%. Lack of independent movement of an adjacent mass and ovary was strongly associated with absence of ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Benign cystic tumors, specifically dermoid or mucinous cysts, are the most frequent causes of ovarian torsion. In clinical practice, adnexal torsion is usually subjected to adnexectomy to prevent embolism of thrombosed ovarian veins and its sequelae. However, this intervention is unsatisfactory for young women who want to preserve their fertility. In such situations, conservative management with untwisting of the adnexa, followed by cystectomy to preserve part of the ovary, would be a better option. In this report, we present a case of adnexal torsion due to cystic teratoma. A 25-year-old unmarried woman with lower abdominal pain and nausea was referred to our emergency room with suspicion of an ovarian mass. Ultrasonography showed a left ovarian mass measuring 9.7 x 6.5 x 6.2 cm with heterogeneous components within it. Laparoscopy showed an enlarged, dusky left ovary with torsion. Detorsion was performed and followed by cystectomy. The pathology revealed cystic teratoma of the ovary. We report this case to emphasize that untwisting of potentially viable adnexa, followed by cystectomy, in patients with adnexal torsion appears to be a safe procedure. This conservative approach should be encouraged in women of childbearing age to reduce the possibility of premenopausal loss of ovarian function."

The etiology, symptoms, medical management, and nursing care of the patient experiencing a perinatal hemorrhage are discussed. Hemorrhage during the antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum period is a life-threatening emergency for the mother and/or fetus. Early antepartum hemorrhage (before 20 weeks gestation) can be related to abortion/miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or gestational trophoblastic disease; late antepartum hemorrhage (after 20 weeks gestation) may result from placental abruption and placenta previa. Intrapartum hemorrhage is most commonly due to placental abruption, or to uterine rupture, uterine inversion, invasive conditions of the placenta, or complications of Cesarean birth. Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as blood loss greater than 500 ml in a vaginal delivery or 1000 ml in a Cesarean birth; early postpartum hemorrhage occurs during the first 24 hours after delivery; late postpartum hemorrhage occurs after the first 24 hours after delivery. The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony; however, lacerations, hematomas, and subinvolution of the uterus can also cause postpartum hemorrhage. Nurses who understand how to assess, plan, intervene, and evaluate outcomes for perinatal hemorrhage are in the position to prevent the major tragedies that can accompany hemorrhage in pregnancy and shortly afterward."

    "abstract": "Primary ovarian pregnancy constitutes <1% of ectopic gestations. Likewise, bilateral tubal ligation failure is uncommon, occurring in approximately 1% of tubal sterilization procedures. Should pregnancy occur after bilateral tubal ligation, of every 3 such pregnancies, 1 will be an ectopic. The incidence of ovarian pregnancy after tubal ligation has not been reported, but must be extremely rare. A 30-year-old, breast-feeding, white woman 6 months postpartum, with bilateral tubal ligation after delivery, developed acute right lower quadrant pain while excercising. Evaluation in the emergency room revealed rebound tenderness in the lower right abdomen, a positive beta-hCG level and ultrasound findings suspicious for a right ectopic pregnancy. Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitoneum, previously ligated but otherwise-normal-appearing fallopian tubes, and a ruptured and bleeding right ovary. The pelvis was otherwise normal. Histology of the right ovarian wedge resection showed chorionic villi consistent with ovarian pregnancy. Both fallopian tubes were religated, and a review of the original tubal ligation histology confirmed tubal lumen in both segments. While ectopic pregnancy is a known but rare risk of failed tubal sterilization, pregnancy involving the fallopian tube is usually reported after tubal ligation failure. The rarely seen primary ovarian pregnancy is usually associated with intrauterine contraceptive devices or occurs in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease. Ovarian pregnancies are associated with massive hemoperitoneum in women unaware that they are pregnant."

    "abstract": "Pelvic ultrasound performed by emergency physicians can identify a definite diagnosis in the majority of symptomatic first-trimester pregnant patients on the initial emergency department (ED) visit. However, a significant minority of such patients are diagnosed as having an indeterminate pregnancy state requiring further testing and consultation. The authors investigated the final outcome of patients with an initial indeterminate ED first-trimester pelvic ultrasound examination in the setting of an interdepartmental protocol to rule out ectopic pregnancy. This was an observational prospective cohort study performed at a regional, urban ED with more than 100,000 patient visits over a 13-month period. Pelvic ultrasound for first-trimester patients was prospectively performed by emergency physicians with gynecologic consultation for lack of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) ultrasound findings. IUP was defined as a fundal gestational sac with either a yolk sac or a fetal pole. Pelvic ultrasounds were classified into diagnostic categories including definite IUP, embryonic demise, molar pregnancy, definite ectopic pregnancy, and indeterminate. For all patients with indeterminate pelvic ultrasound findings, final diagnostic categories and patient outcome were established by the use of patient records, obstetric ultrasound reports, laboratory studies, operative reports, and pathology reports. All patients with ectopic pregnancy were followed for mode of treatment. Descriptive statistics were calculated. A total of 1,490 ED first-trimester pelvic ultrasound examinations were performed over 13 months establishing the following diagnostic rates for initial ED visit: IUP 1,037 (70%), demise 127 (8%), definite ectopic pregnancy 24 (2%), molar pregnancy 2 ( < 1%), and indeterminate 300 (20%). The 300 indeterminate patients were classified using the above protocol into the following final diagnostic categories: embryonic demise 158 (53%), IUP 88 (29%), ectopic pregnancy 44 (15%), and unknown outcome 10 (3%). Indeterminate patients with ectopic pregnancy were treated with methotrexate in 25 of 44 cases (57%) and surgically in 16 of 44 cases (36%); there were no laparotomies. In contrast, ectopic pregnancy patients diagnosed on initial ED visit were treated surgically in 20 of 24 cases (83%), including four laparotomies. The outcome of symptomatic first-trimester patients with indeterminate ED pelvic ultrasounds is poor, with significantly high rates of embryonic demise and ectopic pregnancy. However, those indeterminate patients with the eventual diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy have a higher rate of medical methotrexate treatment and a reduced rate of invasive surgical treatment compared with ectopic pregnancy patients diagnosed at initial ED visit."

    "title": "Gynecologic ultrasound in emergency medicine.",
    "abstract": "The true value of ultrasound in acute abdominal pain lies in its ability to detect gynecologic disorders and effectively rule out other causes of acute abdominal pain that require surgical repair. Although the emergent gynecologic indications discussed in this article are few in number, this does not suggest that the nonpregnant patient presenting to the ED with abdominal pain should not receive an ultrasound examination. On the contrary, the author believes that in a \"perfect world,\" ultrasound should be the initial imaging study in most of these patients. The reality is that it is difficult to convince radiology colleagues to call in a sonologist in the middle of the night for any indication other than ovarian torsion when CT scans can diagnose ovarian cysts and tubo-ovarian abscess. As was pointed out in the section on ovarian torsion, even adequate ovarian blood flow does not rule out this diagnosis.Ideally, an ultrasound of the pelvis could be undertaken at the time of the pelvic examination, adding as little as 5 to 10 minutes. If a gynecologic disorder could be confirmed, other imaging studies might be unnecessary,thereby reducing cost (potential savings on laboratory tests, cervical cultures, or CT scans), length of stay, and adverse complications of CT(contrast material reactions, and radiation exposure).Emergency medicine ultrasound continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are working toward a time when most EPs will be competent and comfortable performing bedside ultrasound examinations in a limited number of applications. The gynecologic application of ultrasound,however, requires skill beyond the level of the primary applications of emergency medicine ultrasound-specifically, mastering Doppler ultra-sound. Although ultrasound has proved to be a valuable imaging modality in the nonpregnant patient with acute abdominal pain when performed by a seasoned sonographer, the role of ED ultrasound has been limited to those EPs with significantly more training. The author believes that even limited expertise in gynecologic ultrasound is valuable in helping direct the management of these patients. Further research by skilled EP sonographers eventually will help define the role of EPs in this particular application of ultrasound. EPs should not be discouraged from developing expertise in this examination when a confirmatory study in radiology will be performed. Miles on the \"ultrasound odometer\" will not only sharpen sonographic skills but also will help the EP to better communicate with nonpregnant patients presenting with abdominal pain. There is a fairly specific barometer already in place to gauge one's gynecologic ultrasound skills: a seasoned EP sonographer never skips over the chart of a young woman with right lower quadrant pain."

The pregnancy was the result of natural conception after ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. Transvaginal sonography revealed five intrauterine gestational sacs containing five live embryos.

Laparoscopic findings disclosed the enlarged uterus with the unruptured right ectopic pregnancy in the ampullary region and an extrauterine pregnancy in the left tube as well. A linear salpingotomy was performed on the right tubal pregnancy. We decided to perform salpingectomy on the left tube because it was impossible to preserve the tube, and exploration of it showed the existence of another gestational sac. It is necessary to decry inappropriate and injudicious use of assisted reproductive technologies, especially by individuals with little or no training in monitoring the agents and treatments prescribed. In 2003, still waiting for official legislation from the Italian Parliament on assisted reproductive technology, we have to face dramatic situations, such as this very unique case of heterotopic pregnancy."

Ectopic pregnancy treatment has changed in the last 20 years coincident with a decrease in maternal mortality from ectopic pregnancy. Sudden death was the presenting scenario in 75% of nonpreventable ectopic deaths, an increase from previous analyses. A large racial disparity is apparent.

Many other causes of pelvic pain associated with an adnexal mass can occur in pregnant patients, however. Some causes are benign and others require urgent management and treatment. Clinical presentation and physical examination can be misleading in pregnancy. The location of pain may be atypical for the pathologic entity, the pain may be muted, and in the case of infection, fever and leukocytosis can be absent.

Clinical assessment of the pregnancy outcome at this stage is less reliable. US examination is crucial in establishing IUP and early pregnancy failure and to exclude other causes of bleeding, such as ectopic pregnancy and molar pregnancy. Diagnosis of a normal IUP at this stage not only assists the physician in an expectant management, but also gives a psychologic boost to the patient. With recent advances in US technology and the availability of high-frequency transvaginal transducers, reliable diagnosis of early pregnancy failure can be made even before the embryo is visible."

    "abstract": "Management of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) includes hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte management. Abdominal paracentesis is also used as minimally invasive form of management in selected cases of severe OHSS following ovulation induction. However, if pregnancy ensues, the syndrome persists for a longer period, and the clinical manifestations of severe OHSS could mask the picture of a bleeding gestational sac. It could be easily overlooked unless the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy is kept in mind in cases of severe OHSS exacerbated by early pregnancy with or without a previous ectopic pregnancy history. We report a case of severe OHSS with simultaneous bilateral tubal pregnancy following intrauterine insemination (IUI). A 31-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian disease developed severe OHSS during the therapeutic course of IUI. An emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed 14 days after admission, and the operative findings showed persistent profuse bleeding from the bilateral fimbrial ends with marked enlargement of the ampullary portions. A linear salpingotomy was performed by a longitudinal incision along the area of maximal distension of the dilated fallopian tubes to preserve her fertility. We recommend that in cases of severe OHSS exacerbated by early pregnancy, serial serum beta-hCG and transvaginal ultrasound follow-up may be necessary due to the potential association of severe OHSS in pregnancy with an ectopic pregnancy."

A prospective study of one hundred patients with tubal ectopic pregnancies was carried out in the emergency ward by two operators from January 1993 to March 1999. Following transabdominal and/or endovaginal sonography of the pelvis, color Doppler of the adnexa and of any suspected latero-uterine abnormal vascularity were studied with pulsed Doppler. The diastolic index (D/S) was measured on 4 consecutive complexes. Sixty-six peripheral hypervascularizations, 27 irregular hypervascularizations and 7 false negatives were found with color Doppler. The pulsed Doppler spectrum revealed a low-impedance flow in 47 cases (D/S index > or = 0.35) and a high-impedance flow in 46 cases (D/S index < 0.35). The latter spectrum was found in 7 cases of tubal rupture with massive hemorrhage and 39 cases of barely evolutive ectopic pregnancies. Color Doppler facilitated the diagnosis of small ectopic pregnancies (gestational sac less than 1 cm and echogenic lesions less than 2 cm in maximum diameter). Our work with pulsed Doppler revealed the frequence of high-impedance flow which, in the absence of massive hemoperitoneum, strongly suggests a barely evolutive ectopic pregnancy."

In unconscious patients in the reproductive age this differential diagnosis has to be taken in mind for the choice of the therapeutic management. A 30- year-old woman (II-gravida, I-para) suffering for about 18 hours from \"upper abdominal pain\" was found in somnolent and in reduced conditions by her relatives. Unconscious and with all signs of a hemorrhagic shock, she was transferred to the emergency department of the UKBF. After stabilization of circulation, a diagnostic laparoscopy has been performed with the finding of about 2000 ml of coagulated and fresh blood, but without the confirmation of a extrauterine pregnancy (EUP): the small pelvis and his organs were without any signs of EUP. The laparoscopic approach has been changed into a secondary median laparotomy. After exclusion of other reasons for a intraabdominal bleeding (such as spleen rupture or gastrointestinal bleeding), and the complete removal of all intraabdominal blood clots, a embryo, his placenta and the place of placental insertion has been found in the mesenterium jejuni. The surgical procedure was finished in the usual way. The postoperative healing process was uncomplicated. Our case did meet Veits criteria of a abdominal pregnancy: intact embryo, no contact between placenta and fallopian tubes or ovaries, resp., but definitive insertion of the placenta in the distant peritoneum. In woman in their reproductive age suffering from intraabdominal bleeding, the exclusion of a ectopic pregnancy is essential. In the case of a vital emergency, and because of suboptimal management conditions (without a sufficient patients history, lack of vaginal sonography, instable circulation because of delayed diagnosis), excluding the opportunity of a laparoscopic exploration, the correct diagnosis of the early abortion of a abdominal pregnancy has to be made by open surgery."

However, with the current rise in heterotopic gestations, this standard of care should be re-evaluated. If emergency bedside ultrasonography reveals an intrauterine gestation in the presence of either a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis or a co-existent ovarian cyst, one must consider and search for a heterotopic pregnancy."

Eight of all the patients treated in our department between 1995 and 2002 had been diagnosed for ectopic pregnancy that developed in a Caesarean section scar. They comprised this case series group. Four of them underwent methotrexate treatment; one had expectant management, one transcervical aspiration of the gestational sac and two by open surgery. All the non-surgically treated women had an uneventful outcome. One underwent a term Caesarean hysterectomy and the other first trimester hysterotomy and excision of the pregnancy located in the scarred uterus. Analysis of all these women's obstetric history revealed that five of them (63%) had been previously operated because of breech presentation, one had a cervical pregnancy and one had placenta previa. Four of them (50%) had multiple (> or = 2) Caesarean sections. The women at risk for pregnancy in a Caesarean section scar appear to be those with a history of placental pathology, ectopic pregnancy, multiple Caesarean sections and Caesarean breech delivery.

In this systematic review we aimed to evaluate its value when ancillary tests are not readily available or when they are equivocal. Suspicion of EP is based on the presence of one or more of the following signs: vaginal bleeding, acute pelvic pain, or any risk factors for EP occurring in a pregnant woman. Detection of early pregnancy by urinary or serum hCG testing must be systematic because neither medical history nor physical examination can rule out early pregnancy with a high level of confidence. No isolated sign has sufficient diagnostic accuracy to rule out EP. In presence of vaginal bleeding without pain and if abdominal and pelvic examination are normal the risk of EP is very low. The presence of spontaneous pain moderate to severe, peritoneal signs, or definite pain during digital cervical mobilization increase the probability of EP. Absence of these signs does not rule out EP but tend to eliminate tubal rupture. In the presence of these signs one may consider an emergency transfer in a specialized center. In their absence, suspicion of EP may have outpatient diagnosis procedures."

These 2 patients were 9 and 13 years old, with abdominal colic pain of 48 and 36 hours of evolution. The diagnosis by doppler sonography was ovarian torsion, with a 4 cms cyst in the right ovary in the first case and a 5 cms cyst in the left ovary in the second patient. Both patients were operated on. After untwisting the ovary, we instille warm saline solution to this ovary and, after waiting for 10 minutes, we resect the ovarian cyst and it recuperates partial and heterogeneous its pink colour. We advise to the family about the possibility of surgical reintervention if the ovary is not viable. After 10 and 12 days of surgical intervention, the Doppler sonography has confirmed the existence of ovary flow and the symmetry of affected ovary in comparation to the opposite on. At the present, both patients are asymptomatic, with exhaustive ultrasound controls. Ovarian torsion is the most frequent complication of ovarian tumours of pediatrics (3-16%) and this is a real emergency in gynecology. Traditionally, it has been recommended the exeresis of ovarian torsion. Regardless the blue aspect of isquemic ovary affected by torsion and the time of evolution, in our experience when there is a minimal possibility of ovarian viability, it is possible to follow a conservative therapy because the macroscopical aspect of the ovary is not necessarily related with the following evolution of the case."

The objective of this study was to explore the possibility that an isolated measurement of hCG isoforms/subunits rather than total hCG could be used as a single test for ectopic pregnancy. Total and intact hCG, free hCG beta- and alpha-subunits (hCGbeta and -alpha), and hCG beta-core fragment were measured by RIA and IRMA in the serum and urine of 76 women presenting at outpatient emergency departments with a positive pregnancy test, lower abdominal pain, and/or vaginal bleeding. Final diagnoses were based on outcomes of pregnancies and tissue histology. Twenty-seven of the 76 women were subsequently diagnosed with viable pregnancies, 37 with spontaneous miscarriage, and 12 with ectopic pregnancy. Concentrations of all forms of hCG were lower in cases of ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous miscarriage than in viable pregnancies. Serum samples gave better results than urine samples. The free hCGbeta isoform (P <0.0001) had 100% sensitivity at a specificity of 79% at a 281 pmol/L (6.5 micro g/L) cutoff. Total hCG (P = 0.005) had comparable ROC characteristics with a 100% sensitivity and 68% specificity at a cutoff value of 1053 pmol/L (375 IU/L). Neither hCGbeta (P = 0.7) nor total hCG (P = 0.4) could distinguish ectopic pregnancies from spontaneous miscarriage. Measurement of serum free hCGbeta at the time of presentation can identify women with a high probability of ectopic pregnancy who may benefit from closer surveillance, reducing the risk of tubal rupture."

    "abstract": "Acute pelvic pain may be the manifestation of various gynecologic and non-gynecologic disorders from less alarming rupture of the follicular cyst to life threatening conditions such as rupture of ectopic pregnancy or perforation of inflamed appendix. In order to construct an algorithm for differential diagnosis we divide acute pelvic pain into gynecologic and non-gynecologic etiology, which is than subdivided into gastrointestinal and urinary causes. Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency and should always be considered in differential diagnosis if appendix has not been removed. Apart of clinical examination and laboratory tests, an ultrasound examination is sensitive up to 90% and specific up to 95% if graded compression technique is used. Still it is user-depended and requires considerable experience in order to perform it reliably. Meckel's diverticulitis, acute terminal ileitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis and functional bowel disease are conditions that should be differentiated from other causes of low abdominal pain by clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging tests. Dilatation of renal pelvis and ureter are typical signs of obstructive uropathy and may be efficiently detected by ultrasound. Additional thinning of renal parenchyma suggests long-term obstructive uropathy. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, salpingitis and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts are three most commonly diagnosed gynecologic conditions presenting as an acute abdomen. Degenerating leiomyomas and adnexal torsion occur less frequently. For better systematization, gynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain could be divided into conditions with negative pregnancy test and conditions with positive pregnancy test. Pelvic inflammatory disease may be ultrasonically presented with numerous signs such as thickening of the tubal wall, incomplete septa within the dilated tube, demonstration of hyperechoic mural nodules, free fluid in the \"cul-de-sac\" etc. Color Doppler ultrasound contributes to more accurate diagnosis of this entity since it enables differentiation between acute and chronic stages based on analysis of the vascular resistance. Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts may be presented by variety of ultrasound findings since intracystic echoes depend upon the quality and quantity of the blood clots. Color Doppler investigation demonstrates moderate to low vascular resistance typical of luteal flow. Leiomyomas undergoing degenerative changes are another cause of acute pelvic pain commonly present in patients of reproductive age. Color flow detects regularly separated vessels at the periphery of the leiomyoma, which exhibit moderate vascular resistance. Although the classic symptom of endometriosis is chronic pelvic pain, in some patients acute pelvic pain does occur. Most of these patients demonstrate an endometrioma or \"chocolate\" cyst containing diffuse carpet-like echoes. Sometimes, solid components may indicate even ovarian malignancy, but if color Doppler ultrasound is applied it is less likely to obtain false positive results. One should be aware that pericystic and/or hillar type of ovarian endometrioma vascularization facilitate correct recognition of this entity. Pelvic congestion syndrome is another condition that can cause an attack of acute pelvic pain. It is usually consequence of dilatation of venous plexuses, arteries or both systems. By switching color Doppler gynecologist can differentiate pelvic congestion syndrome from multilocular cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease or adenomyosis. Ovarian vein thrombosis is a potentially fatal disorder occurring most often in the early postpartal period. Hypercoagulability, infection and stasis are main etiologic factors, and transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound is an excellent diagnostic tool to diagnose it. Acute pelvic pain may occur even in normal intrauterine pregnancy. This may be explained by hormonal changes, rapid growth of the uterus and increased blood flow. Ultrasound is mandatory for distinguishing normal intrauterine pregnancy from threatened or spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy and other complications that may occur in patients with positive pregnancy test. Incomplete abortion is visualized as thickened and irregular endometrial echo with certain amount of intracavitary fluid. If applied, color Doppler ultrasound reveals low vascular resistance signals in richly perfused intracavitary area. Transvaginal sonography has high sensitivity and specificity in visualization of uterine and adnexal signs of ectopic pregnancy. Color Doppler examination may aid in detection of the peritrophoblastic flow. Furthermore, it facilitates detection of ectopic living embryo, tubal ring or unspecific adnexal tumor. Corpus luteum cysts and leiomyomas are another cause of pelvic pain during pregnancy, which can be correctly diagnosed by ultrasound. Detection of uterine dehiscence and rupture in patients with history of prior surgical intervention on uterine wall relies exclusively on correct ultrasound diagnosis. In patients with placental abruption sonographer detects hypoechoic complex representing either retroplacental hematoma, subchorionic hematoma or subamniotic hemorrhage. In closing, ultrasound has already become important and easily available tool which can efficiently recognize patients with possibly threatening conditions of different origins."

Although hospital-based African studies indicate EP incidence has probably increased in Africa in recent decades, major methodological limitations in the published literature make it impossible to draw formal conclusions concerning the incidence of EP in Africa in recent years. As in industrialized countries, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) associated with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) must be considered as the most important risk factor for EP in developing countries. In African developing countries, a majority of hospital-based studies have reported EP case fatality rates of around 1-3%, 10 times higher than that reported in industrialized countries. Late diagnosis, leading in almost all cases to major complications, and emergency surgical treatments are key elements accounting for such high fatality rates in women suffering from EP in Africa. EP should be considered a relevant public health indicator in developing countries, providing an overall picture of the capacity of a health system to deal with the diagnosis and treatment of emergency situations, especially in the field of obstetrics and gynecology."

The third patient went to the emergency department for low abdominal pain with vaginal spotting and was mis-diagnosed as having a tubal pregnancy from the initial ultrasound examination. Exploratory laparotomy was done for evacuation of the abnormally implanted conception tissue. Transarterial embolization of bilateral uterine arteries (UAs) was performed to stop postoperative bleeding in one case and to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage in the other two. Subsequently, the postoperative bleeding case underwent cesarean delivery of a full-term infant following an uneventful pregnancy. Conservative surgical treatment following transarterial embolization of bilateral uterine arteries is an alternative method of managing the patients with early pregnancy in the scar from a cesarean section. This technique preserves the uterus and greatly reduces morbidity."

Evaluation of a cohort of patients presenting to an emergency department to exclude an ectopic pregnancy. Over a 58-month study period (January 1992-October 1996), 1,510 consecutive, pregnant women presenting to an emergency department with pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding to exclude an ectopic pregnancy were evaluated. A comparison was made of the presenting signs and symptoms between patients with and without a previous history of an ectopic pregnancy. Of patients presenting to exclude an ectopic pregnancy, 105 had a history of an ectopic pregnancy, and 1,355 had no such history. Fifty patients were excluded because they were lost to follow-up or transferred their care to another hospital. Those with a history of an ectopic pregnancy were more likely to be diagnosed again with an ectopic pregnancy, were older and were more likely to have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and abdominal surgery. Patients with a history of an ectopic pregnancy presented earlier with a lower hCG level. Women with a previous history of an ectopic present in a clinically different manner than do those without such a history."

We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of 15441 primiparas who delivered singleton breech at term. Information was obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Register, the Register of Death Causes, and the Denmark Patient Register. Elective cesarean delivery was associated with lower rates of puerperal fever and pelvic infection (relative risk [RR] 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70, 0.92), hemorrhage and anemia (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84, 0.97), and operations for wound infection (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.57, 0.83) than emergency cesarean delivery. There was a higher rate of puerperal fever and pelvic infection (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.11, 1.25) than for vaginal delivery. Thromboembolic disease occurred in 0.1% of women with cesarean delivery, and anal sphincter rupture occurred in 1.7% of women with vaginal delivery. Elective cesarean delivery was not associated with subsequent ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, placental complications, uterine rupture, or adverse neonatal outcome. Women with elective cesarean delivery were more often delivered by elective cesarean in their second pregnancy, compared with women delivered vaginally (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.21, 1.29). Elective cesarean delivery was associated with a lower rate of a subsequent delivery during the study period and a longer mean delivery interval than for vaginal delivery. Elective cesarean delivery for term breech carries a low risk of severe maternal complications."

    "abstract": "In this era of cost containment, laparoscopic management of ectopic pregnancy has become the mainstay of dealing with this common gynecologic emergency. The aim of surgical intervention remains conservation of the fallopian tube, if possible; salpingectomy is reserved for cases of tubal rupture and/or recurrent ectopic pregnancy, where little hope exists of salvaging tubal function. A 28-year-old woman, para 2, underwent laparoscopic salpingostomy for ectopic pregnancy. She experienced intraabdominal bleeding within the initial 12 hours of the postoperative period. On exploratory laparotomy, there was active bleeding from the site of the salpingostomy, and a salpingectomy was performed. The patient was lost to follow-up and on postoperative day 21 presented with signs of intraabdominal bleeding; repeat laparotomy revealed active bleeding from trophoblastic implants within the greater omentum. The omentum was adherent to the anterior abdominal wall at the site of umbilical trocar placement. An infracolic omentectomy was performed, with a subsequent uneventful postoperative course; the patient was followed until resolution of the serum beta-hCG. Postoperative surveillance is important. Positive intraabdominal pressure during laparoscopic surgery and the Trendelenburg position may be contributory to cephalad migration of trophoblast remnants, with the scavenging action of the omentum and adherence to the site of umbilical trocar placement theoretically providing a mechanism for neovascularization and sustenance of the parasitic trophoblast."

To quantify this increased risk by establishing and comparing the beta-hCG distributions of symptomatic women with ectopic pregnancies, abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and normal intrauterine pregnancies. The authors reviewed the records of a cohort of women who visited an urban emergency department (ED) during a 34-month period with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding and non-zero quantitative beta-hCG levels. Explicit criteria were used to determine whether the pregnancy ultimately turned out to be intrauterine and normal, intrauterine and abnormal, or ectopic. Probability distributions were compared using frequency distributions, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and likelihood ratios. Of 730 ED patients included in the analysis, 96 (13%) had ectopic pregnancies, 253 (35%) had abnormal intrauterine pregnancies, and 381 (52%) had normal intrauterine pregnancies. The beta-hCG distributions of patients with ectopic pregnancies and abnormal intrauterine pregnancies were similar and much lower than the beta-hCG distribution of patients with normal intrauterine pregnancies. A beta-hCG level less than 1500 mIU/mL more than doubled the odds of ectopic pregnancy (likelihood ratio = 2.24). Of the 158 patients with beta-hCG below 1500 mIU/mL, 40 (25%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 19% to 32%) had ectopic pregnancies, and only 25 (16%; CI = 11% to 22%) had normal intrauterine pregnancies. In women with pain or bleeding and serum beta-hCG levels less than 1500 mIU/mL, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is substantially increased, while the likelihood of normal intrauterine pregnancy is low."

A substantial proportion of women treated for C trachomatis infection are reinfected by an untreated male sex partner in the first several months after treatment. Effective strategies to ensure partner treatment are needed. The goal of the study was to determine whether repeated infections with C trachomatis can be reduced by giving women doses of azithromycin to deliver to male sex partners. A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted among 1,787 women aged 14 to 34 years with uncomplicated C trachomatis genital infection diagnosed at family planning, adolescent, sexually transmitted disease, and primary care clinics or emergency or other hospital departments in five US cities. Women treated for infection were randomized to one of two groups: patient-delivered partner treatment (in which they were given a dose of azithromycin to deliver to each sex partner) or self-referral (in which they were asked to refer their sex partners for treatment). The main outcome measure was C trachomatis DNA detected by urine ligase chain reaction (LCR) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by 4 months after treatment. The characteristics of study participants enrolled in each arm were similar except for a small difference in the age distribution. Risk of reinfection was 20% lower among women in the patient-delivered partner treatment arm (87/728; 12%) than among those in the self-referral arm (106/726; 15%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-1.05; = 0.102). Women in the patient-delivered partner treatment arm reported high compliance with the intervention (82%). Patient-delivered partner treatment for prevention of repeated infection among women is comparable to self-referral and may be an appropriate option for some patients."

In the past decade, several organizations in EM have issued position statements on the use of this technology. Program training content is currently driven by the recently published \"Model of the Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine,\" which includes BU as a necessary skill. The authors sought to determine the current status of BU training in EM residency programs. A survey was mailed in early 2001 to all 122 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited EM residency programs. The survey instrument asked whether BU was currently being taught, how much didactic and hands-on training time was incorporated into the curriculum, and what specialty representation was present in the faculty instructors. In addition, questions concerning the type of tests performed, the number considered necessary for competency, the role of BU in clinical decision making, and the type of quality assurance program were included in the survey. A total of 96 out of 122 surveys were completed (response rate of 79%). Ninety-one EM programs (95% of respondents) reported they teach BU, either clinically and/or didactically, as part of their formal residency curriculum. Eighty-one (89%) respondents reported their residency program or primary hospital emergency department (ED) had a dedicated ultrasound machine. BU was performed most commonly for the following: the FAST scan (focused abdominal sonography for trauma, 79/87%); cardiac examination (for tamponade, pulseless electrical activity, etc., 65/71%); transabdominal (for intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, etc., 58/64%); and transvaginal (for intrauterine pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, etc., 45/49%). One to ten hours of lecture on BU was provided in 43%, and one to ten hours of hands-on clinical instruction was provided in 48% of the EM programs. Emergency physicians were identified as the faculty most commonly involved in teaching BU to EM residents (86/95%). Sixty-one (69%) programs reported that EM faculty and/or residents made clinical decisions and patient dispositions based on the ED BU interpretation alone. Fourteen (19%) programs reported that no formal quality assurance program was in place. The majority of ACGME-accredited EM residency programs currently incorporate BU training as part of their curriculum. The majority of BU instruction is done by EM faculty. The most commonly performed BU study is the FAST scan. The didactic component and clinical time devoted to BU instruction are variable between programs. Further standardization of training requirements between programs may promote increasing standardization of BU in future EM practice."

Patients were enrolled if a progesterone assay was collected the day of the emergency department visit. Patients were excluded if lost to follow-up. One hundred sixty patients were enrolled. Of these, 24 were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy. The sensitivity and specificity of progesterone identifying abnormal pregnancy were 84% and 97%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of progesterone identifying ectopic pregnancy were 88% and 40%, respectively. In the 2 subclasses, the progesterone cutpoint was both sensitive and specific in identifying abnormal pregnancy and was sensitive but only moderately specific for identifying ectopic pregnancy."

Retrospective analysis performed on 75 patients diagnosed and hospitalised with ectopic pregnancy from January 1996 to May 2001. The medical records of each patient were evaluated. Treatment options: immediate surgical treatment (44%), methotrexate (MTX) therapy (43%) and expectant management (13%). MTX therapy success rate was 78.1%. Laparotomy was performed in 52.5% of surgically treated women. Over time there was an increase in the use of laparoscopic surgery: 75% of women underwent laparoscopy in the period 2000-2001. The rate of laparotomy still remains higher than the rate previously reported in other studies; the reason is that in our hospital no equipment for laparoscopy is available for emergency condition. Expectant management was effective when there was no pain and serum hCG levels were constantly low or were decreasing. Technological advances allow diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy before severe clinical symptoms arise. Although early diagnosis may contribute to higher incidence, it has also contributed to a decline in morbidity, deaths, and treatment costs. Timely and early diagnosis has made this disorder amenable to medical therapy, with success rates similar to those of traditional surgical treatment. Surgery is preferred when there are tubal ruptures or a high potential for rupture, hypotension, anaemia or ectopic pregnancy which is larger than 3 cm in diameter."

It is a potential issue to which surgeons, especially rural surgeons, should give careful consideration, prior to being faced with an urgent situation during the delivery process. This report details 1 surgeon's experience over a 5-year period with laparoscopic surgery in the pregnant patient, primarily laparoscopic cholecystectomy, at a small rural Nebraska hospital. Eleven laparoscopic operations were conducted in 10 patients. One patient underwent 2 separate operations: cholecystectomy at 6 weeks gestation and reduction of ovarian torsion/appendectomy at 20 weeks. One patient, at term, underwent combination cesarian delivery and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Three patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during their third trimester of pregnancy. All patients had severe signs and symptoms that threatened successful term gestation and/or failed attempts at conservative medical management aimed at delaying cholecystectomy until after delivery. One complication occurred involving uterine perforation with a blunt 10-mm port canula. No fetal injury occurred, and after initial recovery from the cholecystectomy, the baby was successfully delivered later in the pregnancy via cesarian delivery without adverse sequelae. Urgent laparoscopic operations can be carried out successfully in pregnant patients throughout their pregnancy, even in remote locations lacking immediate on-site availability of subspecialty care. The surgeon must be skilled in surgical obstetrics and well trained and experienced in advanced laparoscopic techniques. It is recommended that the same lines of communication and referral for subspecialty involvement be in place as would be required in the management of premature delivery of pregnant patients without surgically urgent disease. Such lines of communication should be developed before the actual need arises. The rural surgeon must have a plan of action well in advance of that first encounter or any subsequent complication."

A negative urine pregnancy test result will generally be used to exclude ectopic pregnancy from further consideration. The following is a report of a patient presenting to an emergency department with hypovolemic shock in conjunction with 2 negative urine beta-hCG analysis results and a quantitative serum beta-hCG level of 7 mIU/mL, a value less than the lower limit of detection for the highly sensitive qualitative urine and serum tests.

Patients were excluded if lost to follow-up. Ultrasonographic examinations were subclassified into 5 groups (ie, empty uterus, nonspecific fluid, echogenic material, abnormal sac, normal sac) on the basis of a previously published classification system. Patients were followed up until the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was either confirmed or excluded. The frequencies of ectopic pregnancy, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated for each of the subclasses. The relative risk of ectopic pregnancy was calculated when appropriate. Seven hundred eighty patients with indeterminate ultrasonographic examinations were identified. One hundred forty-five were lost to follow-up, and therefore, 635 were enrolled. The frequency of ectopic pregnancy for each subclass is as follows: empty uterus, 36 of 259 (13.9%; 95% CI 10.1% to 18.5%); nonspecific fluid, 6 of 127 (4.7%; 95% CI 1.9% to 9.6%); echogenic material, 4 of 93 (4.3%; 95% CI 1.4% to 10.5%); abnormal sac, 0 of 103 (0%; 95% CI 0.0% to 2.9%); and normal sac, 0 of 53 (0%; 95% CI 0.0% to 5.5%).

The means for SI were 0.67 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.68) for non-EPs, 0.64 (95% CI = 0.61 to 0.67) for unruptured EPs, and 0.84 (95% CI = 0.77 to 0.9) for ruptured EPs. The ROC curve for SI, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and systolic blood pressure demonstrated areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.84 (95% CI = 0.78 to 0.88), 0.74 (95% CI = 0.67 to 0.79), 0.63 (95% CI = 0.67 to 0.79), and 0.70 (95% CI = 0.64 to 0.77), respectively. The range of values for SI for patients being evaluated for pain and/or vaginal bleeding within the first trimester of pregnancy, who do not have a ruptured EP, are within the previously reported range of 0.5-0.7 for nonpregnant patients. A SI > 0.85 made the diagnosis of ruptured EP 15.0 (95% CI = 5.6 to 40.4) times more likely. This study suggests that SI could impact directly on the diagnostic and therapeutic course of the patient."

    "abstract": "A 13 year retrospective review of 117 cases of rupture ectopic pregnancy presenting in a rural practice in Oyo State, Nigeria was conducted to determine the clinical pattern and management modalities in this common gynaecological emergency. It showed that the incidence was low due to a low incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease at laparatomy. Autotransfusion and application of appropriate technology in health care delivery played a dominant role in the management of the patients. The mortality rate of 5.9% is still high. Identified contributory factors such as ignorance and inadequate social infrastructure need government intervention to reduce the death rate."

A 27-years-old nulligravida woman underwent ovarian hyperstimulation with human menoposal gonadotrophin (hMG) at another clinic and was admitted to our hospital with severe OHSS. Intravenous fluid therapy, albumin supplementation, and abodminal paracentesis was performed. The patient's massive ascites rapidly resolved, and she was discharged from our hospital. However, 4 weeks later, at about the 8th gestational week, she was readmitted to our hospital because of strong suspicion of abdominal pregnancy. Ultrasonography revealed a gestational sac (GS) and fetus with heartbeat in Douglas' pouch and an emergency laparotomy was performed. Both fallopian tubes, both ovaries and the uterus were completely intact and the GS was found on the anterior surface of the rectum. After removing GS, the muscle layer and serosal layer of the rectum were repaired. No bowel complications developed, and the post operative course was uneventful. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this very rare variant of ectopic pregnancy complicated by OHSS."

A urine HCG test is often relied on by the Emergency Physician as a critical component in the diagnostic regimen of a patient with a possible ectopic pregnancy. We report a case of a false-positive urine beta-HCG test in a patient with a ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess. Though false-positive pregnancy tests with tubo-ovarian abscesses have previously been reported with older methods of HCG detection, we believe that this is the first case where the pregnancy test was the modern ELISA type. The mechanism for the false-positive reaction in this case is unknown, but time may show that the ELISA test kit, like its predecessors, may occasionally give a false-positive reaction in this class of patients."

Our goal was to determine the clinical utility of 3 markers of smooth muscle destruction: creatine phosphokinase (CPK), smooth muscle heavy-chain myosin (SMHC), and myoglobin. This was a prospective cohort study, with consecutive enrollment of all women in the first trimester of pregnancy who presented to our urban emergency department with complaints of lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or both. Patients were excluded from the study if there was a history of recent surgery or major trauma. Data analysis included receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a regression model. A total of 378 patients were enrolled, with 61 patients diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, and 317 patients placed in the non-ectopic pregnancy group with other diagnoses. ROC curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.56 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.61) for CPK, 0.63 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.68) for SMHC, and 0.58 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.63) for myoglobin. A regression model analyzing the effects of race, maternal age, estimated gestational age, and serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit found no significant confounders. Although there is a statistically significant elevation in the serum levels of SMHC, the range of values seen is too large to allow SMHC to be a useful screening tool."

    "abstract": "During the past 25 years, the incidence of ectopic pregnancy has progressively increased while the morbidity and mortality have substantially decreased, and the treatment has progressed from salpingectomy by laparotomy to conservative surgery by laparoscopy and more recently to medical therapy. This therapeutic transition from surgical emergency to medical management has been attributed to early diagnosis through the use of sensitive assays for hCG and the high definition of vaginal ultrasound. By using these sensitive diagnostic tools, we are now able to select those patients who are most likely to respond to medical management versus those who are at high risk of rupture and require surgery. Besides being less invasive and associated with significantly lower risks, medical therapy with methotrexate results in significant cost savings, which have been calculated to be approximately $3,000 per treated patient. Our goal is to identify those patients with ectopic pregnancy who are most likely to respond to methotrexate therapy and least likely to develop significant side effects. Recent studies have helped us define the predictors of success with methotrexate treatment in women with ectopic pregnancy. The reported success rates of treating ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate vary from 71% to 100%. The highest success rates have been reported from institutions that have detailed diagnostic and therapeutic protocols, readily available assays for serum hCG levels, high-resolution vaginal probe ultrasound, and support staff that can closely monitor clinical response. The importance of developing specific protocols to create a clinical environment that supports the effective use of medical therapy for ectopic pregnancy is confirmed by the associated cost savings, decreased morbidity, and patient preference. Modern diagnostic advances and minimally invasive treatments coupled with improved success rates for assisted reproductive technologies should reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with ectopic pregnancy and offer the affected couple a much more optimistic outlook for subsequent reproductive potential."

Twenty consecutive patients admitted to the gynaecological emergency room with suspected clinical diagnosis of ovarian torsion were prospectively assigned to the study. Blood samples were drawn pre-operatively and examined for serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Surgeons were blinded to laboratory results prior to laparoscopy. The pre-operative diagnosis of ovarian torsion was confirmed during an urgent diagnostic laparoscopy in 8 (40%) patients. The surgical diagnosis among the remaining 12 patients was a large ovarian cyst not in torsion. In six out of eight (75.0%) patients with ovarian torsion serum IL-6 concentrations were elevated. None of the 12 patients without torsion had elevated serum IL-6 concentrations. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of women with elevated serum TNF-alpha concentrations, two of eight (25.0%) patients with torsion and four of 12 (33.3%) control cases. Elevated serum IL-6 concentrations, but not serum TNF-alpha concentrations, were significantly associated with the occurrence of ovarian torsion. In patients with vague clinical signs of ovarian torsion, serum IL-6 might help to distinguish which patients should undergo diagnostic laparoscopy."

A retrospective chart review of all surgically proven ectopic pregnancies at our Institution over a 2-year period. One hundred and seventeen cases of ectopic pregnancy were reviewed. Thirty-seven cases met predetermined criteria of 'clinical stability' at first presentation. These patients waited a median 14 h for diagnostic ultrasound with 62% waiting more than 12 h. No adverse events occurred while waiting for this diagnostic study. Preliminary results suggest that pregnant patients with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding in the first trimester who meet specific low-risk clinical criteria could potentially have ultrasound delayed 12-18 h without risk of adverse event. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm the safety of this strategy."

After four hospital days and multiple diagnostic imaging studies, the diagnosis of hematoma caused by physical trauma to the abdomen was elucidated. Proper diagnosis of the cause of the pelvic mass could have been made earlier by careful attention to the social history and by recognizing the high incidence of domestic violence as opposed to the relative infrequency of some other diagnostic entities for which the patient was tested."

The authors conducted a retrospective review of eligible patients presenting to an urban ED between January 1990 and December 1998. Patients were included in the study if they were seen in the ED, had a discharge diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy, were brought immediately to the operating room after a definitive diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy rupture was made, and had more than 400 mL of intraperitoneal blood found at the time of surgery. The ED, hospital, radiology, and operative records were reviewed to determine presenting vital signs, intraperitoneal blood loss, time to diagnosis, time to treatment, and type of US performed. There were 37 patients enrolled; 16 received ED RUQ US (group I) and 21 had a formal US in radiology (group II). The ages, pulses, systolic blood pressures, and volumes of hemoperitoneum were similar between the two groups. The average time to diagnosis from ED arrival was 58 minutes for group I (SD = 57; 95% CI = 28 to 87) and 197 minutes for group II (SD = 82; 95% CI = 162 to 232) (p < or = 0.0001).

Patients with ruptured ectopic pregnancy, who were selected to have RUQ US performed in the ED by emergency physicians, had an average decrease in time to diagnosis of two and a quarter hours, and an average decrease in time to treatment of three and a half hours, compared with those having a formal pelvic US in the radiology department. Further prospective investigation is needed to determine whether ED RUQ US can safely expedite care of patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy."

Decision analysis compared six diagnostic algorithms involving combinations of clinical examination, transvaginal ultrasound, serum progesterone, serum hCG, and D&C. The population was composed of hemodynamically stable women who presented to a tertiary care university emergency department with abdominal pain or bleeding in their first trimesters. Outcome measures included number of missed ectopic pregnancies, potentially interrupted intrauterine pregnancies, surgical and diagnostic procedures, time until diagnosis, and cost. Ultrasound followed by serum hCG in women with nondiagnostic scans yielded the most favorable outcomes; no ectopic pregnancy was missed, only 1% of all potential intrauterine pregnancies were interrupted, and time to diagnosis averaged 1.46 days. Quantitative hCG measurement followed by ultrasound only in women with hCG levels above the discriminatory zone was optimal if sensitivity of ultrasound to diagnose intrauterine pregnancy was less than 93%. Serum progesterone measurement was not favored because it was associated with missed ectopic pregnancies (2.6%). Given the current accuracy of tests for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy, algorithms using a combination of ultrasound and hCG resulted in the best outcomes. Ultrasound as the first step was the most efficient and accurate method of diagnosing ectopic pregnancies."

The study was a cross-sectional survey of 103 women seen at an urban center. We recruited women from several clinical sites: (1) patients with signs or symptoms of an STD seen in a busy women's urgent care unit, (2) women enrolled in clinical studies for STDs or bacterial vaginosis, (3) patients admitted to the hospital and found to have an STD, and (4) women at high risk based on age and sexual activity. A trained female interviewer administered the survey to women agreeing to participate. The questionnaire assessed the patient's awareness of various STDs and their association with adverse outcomes. The survey also evaluated women's knowledge regarding STD prevention. Descriptive analyses were performed using SAS (Cary, North Carolina) on the 103 patients surveyed. The median age of our survey population was 23, 66% were nonwhite, and 37% were on public assistance or uninsured. The population was at high risk for STDs based on the reported history of infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis (6% and 38%, respectively). Of the 103 women surveyed, 33% had never heard of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and 79.6% could not identify any adverse sequelae of PID. Sixty-five percent were unaware that PID increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy, and 56.3% were unaware that it could result in chronic pelvic pain. When asked if they knew of any methods to prevent or reduce their risk of STDs, only 18% mentioned barrier contraception (condoms). Over 57% of respondents could not name a way to prevent STDs. Increased educational efforts targeted at high-risk individuals are necessary to improve knowledge of STDs and their adverse sequelae. With greater knowledge and awareness, individuals and couples may be more likely to practice protective behaviors, such as reducing high-risk exposure, and to increase preventive measures, such as barrier contraception use."

In our review 50% (12 of 24) of patients were treated by oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy and most of these women desired further fertility. In spite of torsion being suspected in 73% (17 of 24), the time interval between admission and operation varied from 0.5 to 52 hours with a mean of 8 hours; 46% (11 of 24) were treated laparoscopically without recourse to laparotomy. As expertise increases, we consider that adnexal torsion will be increasingly managed laparoscopically. These results suggest that more urgent surgery should be scheduled if ovarian torsion is suspected, and in view of recent reports in the literature greater consideration should be given to conservation of infarcted ovaries if further fertility is required."

Twenty-one patients with the diagnosis of EP were randomly matched (1:1) with pregnant patients who subsequently ruled-out for EP. Serum CPK values at presentation were compared between the groups using two-tailed ANOVA, odds ratio, and frequency tables were generated using our a priori hypothesis that a serum CPK of >70 mlU/dL may be useful as a predictor of EP. The mean serum CPK was 118mlU/dL in the EP group and 64 mlU/dL in the non-EP group (P < .0031). Controlling for age, race, and gestational age, there was an association between elevated serum CPK and EP in our study population (with an odds ratio of 6.5). The categorical evaluation (with 95% confidence interval [CI]) of CPK (>70 mIU/dL) as a predictor of EP follows: sensitivity - 100% (80.8 to 100); specificity-- 61.9% (38.7 to 81); PV(+) - 72.4% (52.5 to 88.6); PV(-) - 100% (71.7 to 100).

Reproductive health has three components: the ability to procreate, regulate fertility and enjoy sex; the successful outcome of pregnancy through infant and child survival and growth; and the safety of the reproductive process. According to Mitchell et al., the following are key elements in a reproductive health program: (a) Family planning services that offer complete and accurate information about all contraceptive methods and that make contraceptive services, supplies and counseling accessible. (b) Antenatal care, which research suggests lowers rates of maternal mortality. (c) Safe delivery services, so that all women deliver under some type of supervised care and so that referral systems are established to provide emergency treatment of life-threatening complications of delivery. (d) Postnatal care that contributes to a woman's ability to have a speedy and complete recovery from the stress of pregnancy and childbirth, to enjoy sexual relations without pain and to have safe pregnancies and deliveries in the future. (e) Management of the complications of abortion where safe abortions are not available. (f) Infertility services that enable women to achieve their reproductive goals; and effective screening for or control of reproductive tract infections (RTIs), because RTIs are the most common preventable cause of involuntary infertility and ectopic pregnancy, as well as of chronic pelvic pain and recurrent infection. (g) Management and treatment of systemic sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as HIV and hepatitis B. (h) Symptomatic treatment of urinary tract infections. (i) Detection and treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers, such as cervical cancer. (j) Attention to and treatment of dysmenorhea, which in some cases is the first sign of other problems, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, fibroids, endometrial cancer and ectopic pregnancy. (k) Nutritional supplementation to meet the special needs of adolescents, pregnant or lactating women, and women older than 50 years. (1) Services for menopause and other health problems that women encounter as they grow older. (m) Services for adolescents, including family planning and STD prevention and treatment. It shall be clear that many institutions delivering reproductive health services operate significantly below their physical capacity to see clients, and that much of the equipment required for expanding reproductive health services may already be available for use in family planning and other health services.

    "abstract": "The liberal use of ultrasonography has been advocated in patients with first trimester cramping or bleeding to avoid misdiagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in the emergency department (ED). The cost-effectiveness of different approaches to ultrasound availability has not been previously reported. In this study, we investigated measures of quality and cost-effectiveness in detecting ectopic pregnancy in the ED over a 6-year period, divided into three approximately equal epochs with three distinct approaches to ultrasound availability. The study retrospectively identified 120 cases of ectopic pregnancy seen in the ED over 6 years. There was significant improvement in the percentage of patients with ectopic pregnancy who were documented to have absence of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) at the first visit from 76% during Epoch 1, when there was limited availability of ultrasound through medical imaging (MI Sono), to 88% in Epoch 2, when MI Sono was readily available, to 96% in Epoch 3, when both MI Sono and ultrasound by emergency physicians (ED Sono) were readily available (P = .02). The estimated number of MI Sonos ordered by emergency physicians in patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy increased from 5.2 per ectopic pregnancy in Epoch 1 to 11.8 per ectopic pregnancy in Epoch 2, and declined to 5.5 per ectopic pregnancy in Epoch 3, when 19.9 ED Sonos per ectopic pregnancy were also done. The cost of ED Sono in Epoch 3 was more than offset by savings from avoiding calling in ultrasound technicians after regular medical imaging department hours. The specificity of ED Sono in ruling in an IUP was 100% (95% CI 98.3 to 100%), but analysis of secondary quality indicators reflecting times from first ED visit to treatment in Epoch 3 raised the possibility that an adnexal mass or signs of tubal rupture may have been missed on some ED Sonos. We conclude that increased availability of ultrasonography leads to improved quality in the detection of ectopic pregnancy in the ED, but at the expense of a disproportionate increase in the number of ultrasound studies done per ectopic pregnancy detected. Our study suggests that the most cost-effective strategy is for emergency physicians to screen all patients with first trimester cramping and bleeding with ED Sonos, and to obtain MI Sonos at the time of the initial ED visit in all cases in which the ED Sono is indeterminate or shows no IUP."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that serum markers of smooth muscle destruction have utility in predicting ectopic pregnancy. Our goal was to determine whether a novel marker of muscle destruction, smooth muscle heavy-chain myosin (SMHC), is elevated in the serum of patients with ectopic pregnancy. We conducted a prospective cohort study, with consecutive enrollment, of all women in the first trimester of pregnancy who presented to our urban emergency department with complaints of lower abdominal pain with or without vaginal bleeding. Patients were excluded if there was a history of recent surgery or major trauma. Means were compared using 2-tailed Student's t test with P values less than.05 set for significance. Data analysis included calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a regression model. A total of 175 patients were enrolled; ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed in 29, and 146 had other diagnoses. Patients with ectopic pregnancy had a mean serum SMHC concentration of 2.53 ng/dL (95% CI 1.84 to 3.22), whereas those in the non-ectopic pregnancy group had a mean concentration of 1.41 ng/dL (95% CI 1.23 to 1.60; P <.0001). ROC analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.72 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.79). Regression analysis to examine confounders in each group analyzed the effects of race, maternal age, estimated gestational age, and serum levels of human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit. Our analysis identified only a positive correlation between estimated gestational age and SMHC in the non-ectopic pregnancy group. There is a statistically significant elevation of serum SMHC levels in tubal pregnancy, although our data suggest that the assay has limited clinical utility as a lone marker for ectopic pregnancy. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the assay has a role as an adjunct in the evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to prospectively measure the accuracy of serum progesterone levels to detect ectopic pregnancy. Seven hundred sixteen symptomatic first-trimester emergency department patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding at a tertiary care military teaching hospital had progesterone levels measured by radioimmunoassay with results unavailable to the treating physician. All patients were monitored until a criterion standard diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy was confirmed. A 14-month derivation phase (n=399) used receiver operating characteristic curve testing to select a cutoff value of progesterone less than 22 ng/mL. A 12-month validation phase (n=317) then retested this cutoff value. Combining both phases, there were 434 (61%) viable intrauterine pregnancies, 229 (32%) nonviable intrauterine pregnancies, and 52 (7. 3%) ectopic pregnancies, of which 17 were ruptured. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values (95% confidence intervals) for progesterone levels less than 22 ng/mL to detect ectopic pregnancy were 100% (94% to 100%), 27% (23% to 30%), 10% (7% to 12%), and 100% (98% to 100%), respectively. Given similar disease prevalence, roughly one fourth (178/716) of symptomatic patients can be classified as low risk (0%, 95% confidence interval 0 to 2%) for having an ectopic pregnancy using a progesterone cutoff of 22 ng/mL. Whether implementation of rapid progesterone testing can safely expedite care and reduce the need for urgent diagnostic evaluation or admission remains to be determined."

Association of pre-operative clinical diagnosis and the post-operative histological result. Of 1,576 women studied, the histological report confirmed that products of conception were obtained in 1,465 (93%); in two women (0.13%) molar changes were reported confirming the preoperative diagnosis by ultrasound. Products of conception were not confirmed in the tissue specimens in 0.5% medical terminations, 5% surgical terminations, 10% evacuations following a previous evacuation, 12% evacuations for a failed pregnancy, and 19% evacuations for an incomplete miscarriage. In 87 women (6%), decidua was reported; two of these women had undergone an evacuation for an ultrasound diagnosis of spontaneous miscarriage, but in both a tubal ectopic pregnancy was subsequently diagnosed. There did not appear to be any obvious benefit from routine histological examination of tissue removed at termination of pregnancy or emergency uterine evacuation. The histological result was sometimes not consistent with the pre-operative diagnosis and may result in unnecessary further investigation and treatment unless due consideration is given to the clinical presentation."

The commonly accepted regimens are 150 mg mifepristone administered in several small doses or a single 200 mg dose followed by 0.6 mg oral misoprostol. Complete abortion rates are 90% to 97%. Ultrasound is strongly recommended to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Patients remain in the clinic for four to six hours after misoprostol. If the fetal sac is not expelled during the four-hour observation, the second dose of 0.4 mg misoprostol is given in many of the clinics. Rates of emergency curettage ranged from less than 1% to 4%, and rates of blood transfusion were less than 1%. The major complication of concern is undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy. The Chinese experience has shown that medical abortion is well accepted as an alternative to surgical intervention when provided under medical supervision and administrative monitoring."

Selection of an appropriate imaging modality is essential to ensure prompt management. In the majority of cases, ultrasound can provide specific diagnoses, whereas in others valuable supplemental information can be obtained. CT will be reserved for selected patients in whom further information is needed. Indications of MR imaging in the management of acute pediatric abdomen are currently limited. MR imaging, however, is indicated on an emergency or semi-emergency basis in selected conditions including anomaly of the internal genitalia, ovarian torsion, and congenital biliary dilatation."

A retrospective study was performed on consecutive emergency department patients from August 1, 1991, through August 1, 1998, presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding, a positive beta-hCG test result, and indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound findings. Patients were eligible for the study if they had a second beta-hCG assay performed within 7 days of the initial visit and before either a diagnostic dilation and evacuation or laparoscopy. Patients were excluded if they were lost to follow-up. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on the rate of change of beta-hCG values over a 48-hour interval (increase by >66%, increase by <66%, decrease by <50%, decrease by >50%). In addition, the 4 main groups were further subdivided depending on whether the endometrial cavity was empty at ultrasound examination. Intergroup differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancy based on the rate of change of the beta-hCG value were compared using logistic regression. Logistic regression also was used to determine whether addition of the ultrasound result improved predicative accuracy. A P value of less than.05 was considered significant. Odds ratios (ORs) were determined for each subgroup. Three hundred thirty-one eligible patients were identified; of these, 24 were excluded. Of the 307 enrolled patients, 33 (10.7%) had a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Intergroup differences in the frequency of ectopic pregnancy based on the beta-hCG rate of change were significant (P<.0001). Addition of the ultrasound result to this model further improved predicative accuracy (P<.0001). Overall, patients with increasing beta-hCG values were at increased risk compared with those with decreasing beta-hCG values, and patients with empty uteri at ultrasound were at increased risk compared with those with uteri that were not empty. Combining the beta-hCG rate of change with the ultrasound result identified 3 high-risk groups: patients with beta-hCG values that increased by less than 66% and an empty uterus at ultrasound (OR 24.8); patients with beta-hCG values that decreased by less than 50% and an empty uterus at ultrasound (OR 3.7); and patients with beta-hCG values that increased by more than 66% and an empty uterus at ultrasound (OR 2.6). Patients with beta-hCG values that decreased by more than 50% were found to be at low risk for ectopic pregnancy irrespective of the specific endometrial findings at ultrasound. The rate of change of serial beta-hCG values, in patients with an indeterminate pelvic ultrasound examination, is predictive of ectopic pregnancy. Addition of whether the endometrial cavity is empty at ultrasound leads to a further improvement in predictive accuracy."

This was done with the goal of developing HIV education and counselling services in this setting. HIV status was determined among 196 (96%) of 205 consecutive admissions; 82 (42%) tested HIV positive. The HIV-infected women were younger than the HIV uninfected women (mean age 27 vs 33 years, P=0.001). The disease-specific HIV prevalence was > or = 40% among women who had had abortions, pelvic inflammatory disease, or ectopic pregnancy. The length of hospital stay (mean 5.4 days) and mortality (1%) were similar in the 2 groups. Inpatient gynaecology services may be an important setting in Africa, within which to provide HIV education, counselling and care. This article features a study on the disease-specific prevalence of HIV infection among 196 gynecologic patients admitted to Hlabisa hospital, South Africa, in 1997. The data obtained were presented as crude HIV prevalence and disease-specific HIV prevalence. Findings reflected a high prevalence of HIV infection and showing a significant association with abortion and its complications among the women admitted in this health facility. The study demonstrates that South Africa has been experiencing a high epidemic of HIV, which demands urgent attention and care through the provision of simple, cost-effective and voluntary counseling and testing services in order to help prevent the spread of the disease."

All hemodynamically stable, first-trimester patients with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding who presented to a military teaching hospital emergency department underwent follow-up until an outcome of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) or EP was established. Patients were separated into the high-risk group, defined as having either peritoneal signs or definite cervical motion tenderness; intermediate-risk group, defined as the presence of pain or tenderness, other than midline cramping, plus absence of fetal heart tones, and absence of tissue visible at the cervical os; and low-risk group (neither high- nor intermediate-risk) using recursive partitioning. Summarizing both phases, 915 patients had 845 (93%) IUPs and 70 (7.6%) EPs, with 18 (1.9%) lost to follow-up. The clinical prediction model classified 75 (8.2%) into the high-risk group (sensitivity 31%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21% to 44%; specificity 94%, 95% CI 92% to 95%); and 644 (70%) in the intermediate-risk group (sensitivity 98%, 95% CI 89% to 100%; specificity 25%, 95% CI 22% to 29%).

Transvaginal ultrasound was nondiagnostic in 59 (17.7%) of 333 subjects and 43 (67.2%) of 64 subjects with beta-hCG levels below 1500 mIU/mL at presentation. Preliminary ultrasound diagnoses were reported significantly more frequently when presenting beta-hCG levels were above 1500 mIU/mL (253 [94.1%] of 269 subjects) compared with levels below 1500 mIU/mL (21 [32.8%] of 64 subjects: P < .001; relative risk (RR) 3.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.23, 5.18]).

Sensitivity of transvaginal ultrasound diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy, spontaneous miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy in women who presented with beta-hCG levels below 1500 mIU/mL was 33.3%, 28.2%, and 25.0%, respectively. The sensitivity, predictive value, and accuracy of transvaginal ultrasound for diagnosing complications of early pregnancy were poor when beta-hCG levels were below the discriminatory zone at presentation.

A retrospective chart review was performed at an urban county hospital. The optimal CV was determined by comparing all available patients diagnosed with ECP and patients diagnosed with threatened abortion (TA) in the Emergency Department (ED) who subsequently delivered a baby at the same hospital. The utility of the test was assessed in a group of all known patients who presented to the ED with lower abdominal or pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding between 6 and 13 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA). There were 212 ECPs with measured HCGs. Only nine presented after 13 weeks EGA. The mean HCG value was 5,378 mIU/mL. There was no significant correlation between HCG and EGA. There were 132 TAs with measured HCGs who subsequently delivered. Only four TAs presented before 6 weeks EGA. Regarding the TA patients who presented between 6 and 13 weeks EGA, there were 81 with a mean HCG of 83,810 mIU/mL. Between 6 and 13 weeks EGA, HCG was not significantly correlated with EGA. The entire ECP group was compared with the TA group with 6-13 week EGA. A receiver-operating characteristic curve with nine HCG cutoff values was constructed. Clinically, the optimal CV was 40K. At this level, a test for the condition \"absence of ECP\" had a specificity of 99%, and only two of 212 ECPs in our group would test false-positive with an HCG value over 40K. When the test was applied to a group of 175 women who presented with pain or bleeding between 6 and 13 weeks EGA, the sensitivity and positive predictive value for an intrauterine pregnancy were 24% and 99.9 %, respectively. However, if this test was applied to all patients regardless of clinical findings, and then an ultrasound (U/S) algorithm was applied to the patients who had an HCG of less than 40K, it would predictably increase the rate of ECPs falsely identified as intrauterine pregnancies (IUPs) by 1%, regardless of the false-positive rate of the U/S algorithm itself. Given the potential morbidity and mortality of undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, ultimately neither this test nor any other that is less than 100% specific for IUP can be recommended instead of an initial U/S evaluation for patients who present at risk for ECP."

ED management of children and young adults in cardiac arrest requires an understanding of the heterogeneous pathophysiologic mechanisms and etiologies leading to cardiopulmonary dysfunction in these patients. The emergency physician should give particular focus to airway management for toddlers and preadolescents, because respiratory diseases predominate.

Therefore, in managing women with lower abdominal pain care should be taken to exclude any serious condition before dismissing the patient. PID is a condition in which there is infection of the reproductive tract of women above the internal os of the cervix. This usually occurs as a result of an ascending cervical infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and anaerobic bacteria. The immediate and long term effects of PID include salpingitis, pelvic abscess, peritonitis, infertility and predisposition to tubal ectopic pregnancy. Women with lower abdominal pain should be assessed carefully and if PID is the cause they should be treated for gonococcal, chlamydial and anaerobic bacterial infection. Other gynaecological and surgical causes of lower abdominal pain and the immediate complications of PID require urgent referral to a specialist.

Factors by history that increased the risk of EP included pain that was described as moderate to severe, lateral, or sharp. Pain located in the midline decreased the risk of EP. A history of previous intrauterine device use, infertility, prior pelvic surgery, or tubal ligation were each found to be predictive. On physical examination, the presence of peritoneal signs, cervical motion tenderness, or lateral or bilateral abdominal or pelvic tenderness increased the risk of EP. A uterine size larger than 8 weeks by pelvic examination decreased the risk of EP. Combinations of predictive variables identified subsets of patients with either an increased or decreased frequency of EP, but in no case was a combination identified that would confirm or exclude this diagnosis with a high degree of certainty.

The possibility of a spontaneous abortion in progress or a cervico-isthmic pregnancy were considered. Due to the massive vaginal bleeding and unstable vital signs of the patient, surgical intervention was decided upon to save the woman's life. We first performed dilatation and curettage. There was no gestational villi and severe vaginal bleeding was noted during this procedure. An emergent exploratory laparotomy was then performed, followed finally by a hysterectomy. Pathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of a pregnancy in the previous cesarean section scar. Diagnosis, prevention, clinical evaluation and management of these conditions are discussed."

    "abstract": "The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy has been rising in recent years with the increased use of assisted reproductive techniques (ART). This report describes an unusual clinical presentation in a 24-year-old woman who had a combination of intrauterine triplets and a single intrafallopian pregnancy. Two fetuses located on the same side as the ectopic pregnancy demised after rupture of an ectopic pregnancy at seven weeks of gestation. After performing emergency exploratory laparotomy to manage the ruptured ectopic pregnancy, one intrauterine pregnancy continued smoothly, resulting in the delivery of a 3,550 g normal baby at 38 weeks of gestation. The possible cause of fetal demise may have been the ruptured ectopic pregnancy of the left tube, which compromised the blood supply to the same side of the gestational sacs, but the sac implanted on the right side was compensated by prominent collateral circulation, although that remains a hypothesis. To our knowledge, this is a novel report of such an occurrence."

In this work were studied 78 cases of patients which were treated in the Emergency Room of ABC Hospital, with symptomatology associated to reproductive organs. The age of patients was 27.7 +/- 6.3 years. The more frequent diagnosis before surgery were ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cysts, the remainder patients were operated to determine pain etiology. Ectopic pregnancy antecedent was determinant to have same problem (X2, p < 0.05), other determinative factors were infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease. Abdominal pathology was detected in 97.4% of patients; 98.6% with gynecological pathology. The predictive positive value of preoperative diagnosis was 83.3% and 91.3% for ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cysts, respectively. In 25.6% of the cases endoscopy turned in laparotomy; massive hemoperitoneum in tubal rupture in cases of ectopic pregnancy was the most frequent indication of this conduct. As conclusion, laparoscopy is useful in most of cases of gynecological emergencies. Fast detection or abdominal pathology, in special ectopic pregnancy can be to lower conversion of laparoscopy to open surgery."

We performed a retrospective review of all patients evaluated and diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy in the emergency departments of seven area hospitals during a ten month period. Sixty-four patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, a pelvic ultrasound, and a quantitative B-hCG level were included in the study. Eighteen (28%) of these patients had a quantitative B-hCG less than 1000 mIU/mL. Sixteen of the eighteen patients (89%) with a B-hCG level less than 1000 mIU/mL had sonographic findings suggestive of ectopic pregnancy, such as fluid in the cul-de-sac, or a complex adnexal or cystic mass. Overall, 25% of all patients diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy during this time period had a quantitative B-hCG level less than 1000 mIU/mL and an ultrasound suggestive for ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic ultrasound is useful as a screening tool in the initial evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy, even when the quantitative B-hCG level is below 1000 mIU/mL."

All women presenting with early pregnancy complications had a transabdominal ultrasound scan performed by the attending doctor and checked by a senior doctor. The ultrasound findings were classified as normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), probable abnormal pregnancy, definite ectopic pregnancy, no definite IUP, and other. Women with clinical and ultrasound findings compatible with threatened abortion were referred to a gynaecologist, or were admitted if findings suggested abnormal or ectopic pregnancy, or if a definite IUP could not be confirmed on ultrasound scan. For patients who were admitted or referred, a transvaginal ultrasound scan was performed by the attending gynaecologist. The findings of the gynaecologist were used as the gold standard. 151 cases were enrolled during a four month study period. Ultrasound findings in the emergency department included definite IUP in 95 (63%), probable abnormal IUP in 20 (13%), no definite IUP in 23 (21%), and other findings in four (3%). For evaluating the presence or absence of IUP, sensitivity of the initial scan was 82% (95% confidence interval 76% to 88%) and specificity 92% (88% to 96%). Agreement between junior and senior emergency department doctors on their ultrasound findings was 81% (75% to 87%) and between emergency department senior staff and gynecologists 85% (79% to 91%). The diagnoses made in the emergency department were thought to be compatible with the final assessments by gynaecologist in 72% (65% to 79%). Using either no definite IUP or other findings as a positive screening test for ectopic pregnancy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 80% (74% to 86%), 78% (71% to 85%), 12% (7% to 17%), and 99% (97% to 100%), respectively.

Women aged > or =18 years presenting to the ED with a positive pregnancy test in combination with pelvic or abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, orthostasis, adnexal mass or tenderness, or any historical risk factor for ectopic pregnancy were eligible. Hypotensive or unstable patients were excluded. Endovaginal US was performed and patients with no definite IUP had a serum beta-hCG and SP measured. 314 patients were enrolled, with 14 excluded for lack of follow-up or incomplete SP data, yielding 300 patients. The initial endovaginal US diagnoses included 169 definite IUP, 31 abnormal IUP, 5 definite ectopic pregnancy, and 95 no definite IUP. 68/95 had SP measured, with values of 22.8 +/- 13.4 ng/mL (mean +/- SD) for IUP; 4.9 +/- 6.5 for spontaneous abortion, and 7.5 +/- 7.2 for ectopic pregnancy. The mean values were significantly different (2-tailed t-test) for ectopic pregnancy vs IUP and for spontaneous abortion vs IUP. An SP of > or =11 ng/mL (sensitivity 91%; specificity 84%) was post hoc the best cutoff value for suggesting an IUP when the endovaginal US was not definite for IUP. SP cannot reliably discriminate ectopic pregnancy vs spontaneous abortion in pregnant patients with no definite IUP on endovaginal US; however, a low SP (<11 ng/mL) in this sonographic category suggests an abnormal pregnancy."

A prospective protocol for the evaluation and treatment of women with presumed EP. Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Haemek Medical Center, Afula, Israel. Eight hundred forty women with presumed EP who were seen in our emergency department from January 1988 through December 1995. On the basis of specific sonographic signs and beta-hCG levels, we performed immediate operative laparoscopy in patients with demonstrable extrauterine fetal heart activity or >100 mL of fluid in the pelvic cavity. We followed up all other patients, using defined criteria for laparoscopic intervention. The accuracy of transvaginal sonography in predicting EP was evaluated as part of the described protocol. Overall, 380 patients were found to have EP. Of these, 331 were identified positively by transvaginal sonography and 49 were not. In 27 of 358 laparoscopies, no EP was found. The sensitivity of transvaginal sonography for the prediction of EP was 87% and the specificity was 94%. The positive and negative predictive values were 92.5% and 90%, respectively. In this protocol, which invariably captured the true location of the products of conception, using transvaginal sonography as the primary modality in the evaluation of patients with presumed EP resulted in the use of laparoscopy mainly as a treatment tool. This approach is both safe and economical."

A retrospective analysis of the management of 145 symptomatic patients in early pregnancies without intrauterine gestational sacs from ultrasound examinations, during the period April to June 1994 in Kandang Kerbau Hospital. Patients underwent serial hCG tests over 48 hours with or without repeat ultrasound scans before definitive treatment unless clinical indications for emergency surgery was necessary. There were 35 ectopic pregnancies (24%), 16 were viable intrauterine pregnancies (11%), 87 were non-viable pregnancies (60%) and 7 were of unknown outcome. There were much practice deviations from the protocol. Forty-four percent (64 cases) of the management decisions were made based on the initial clinical and ultrasound findings, and another 14% (21 cases) after a repeat assessment within the next day by either a repeat scan or serial serum hCG over one day. Among them, two of the 29 operated for suspected ectopic pregnancy were not ectopic (7%) and two of the 56 thought not to be ectopic, turned out to be ectopic (4%) (p < 10(-8)). Six percent (8 cases) defaulted after the initial assessments and one of them was found to be ectopic subsequently. Thirty percent (43 cases) adhered to the protocol. They had serial serum hCG done over two days. Seven of them requiring further repeats of serial serum hCG before management decisions were made. Four patients who were operated on were confirmed ectopic and 39 patients not operated on were not ectopic. Three percent (5 cases) were managed by serial hCG over 3 to 5 days and another 3% (4 cases) by repeating scan over one to two weeks without serial hCG. None of these was ectopic. The percentage change of hCG levels over two days gave indications of the likely diagnosis. Adhering to a protocol utilising the principle of ultrasound scan, serial hCGs and selective repeat ultrasound scans are highly recommended for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Any deviation from protocol is dangerous, with a 4% risk of missing an ectopic and a 7% risk of unnecessary operation for suspected ectopic pregnancy."

A structured review was performed of case reports solicited during 1994 and 1995 with possible adverse outcomes related to managed care gatekeeping. Gatekeeping was defined as the requirement imposed by an MCO that ED staff contact on-call gatekeepers (i.e., clinical or nonclinical MCO personnel) to request preauthorization for ED treatment (a requirement that such MCOs enforce by refusing payment for the ED care unless preauthorization is obtained). Cases in which gatekeeper denial of preauthorization occurred were sought. Two physicians agreed on patient eligibility and classification criteria, then independently, retrospectively classified case reports identified as MCO ED payment denials into 1 of 4 categories: 1) adverse outcome; 2) patient placed at increased risk of death or disability; 3) \"near miss\" (emergency physicians prevented adverse outcome by caring for patient despite denial); and 4) none of the above. Of the 143 cases reviewed, 29 reports represented MCO ED payment denial. Of these 29 eligible cases, there were 4 (14%) patients with adverse outcomes, 4 (14%) patients placed at increased risk, and 21 (72%) near misses. All of the 29 cases came from different EDs, representing 9 different states, with the majority from California. Adverse outcomes included respiratory failure from fulminant meningococcemia, hypovolemic syncope from ruptured ectopic pregnancy, hypovolemic arrest from vascular fibroid hemorrhage necessitating emergency hysterectomy, and prolonged postoperative course following ruptured duodenal ulcer. Patients placed at increased risk were diagnosed as having epiglottitis, myocardial infarction, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and delayed treatment of hip septic arthritis. Near misses included diagnoses of ectopic pregnancy (n = 2), pneumothorax (n = 2), alcohol withdrawal seizures and pancreatitis necessitating intensive care unit admission, appendicitis, bacterial meningitis, cerebrovascular accident, cryptococal meningitis in immuno comprised host, endocarditis, incarerated inguinal hernia, meningocococemia, meninoccocal meningitis, peritonsillar abscess, pneumococcal meningitis, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, shock from gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel obstruction, schizophrenic crisis resulting in psychiatric hospitalization, suicidal depression resulting in psychiatric hospitalization, and unstable angina. Adverse outcomes occur with MCO gatekeeping, Although the present study cannot ascertain whether this is a frequent event or a rare one, the safety of MCO gatekeeping deserves further study."

Women either underwent elective curettage or were followed expectantly. Complication rates. In 89 women with minimal tissue, no complications occurred regardless of treatment mode. In 63 women with significant intrauterine tissue, expectant management resulted in more complications (9/24) than elective curettage (1/39). In the expectant group, complications included missed abortion, septic abortion, and incomplete abortion requiring emergency curettage, with one patient requiring a transfusion. In the curettage group one uterine perforation occurred. In women with impending abortions and minimal intrauterine tissue, expectant treatment is safe after ectopic pregnancy has been excluded. In patients with significant intrauterine tissue, the risk of complications may be decreased by elective uterine curettage compared with expectant management."

Although successful medical management of interstitial pregnancy has been reported, evidence does not support success rates equal to that in other ectopic locations. Four cases of interstitial ectopic pregnancy were identified. Only one of the four was successfully treated with medical therapy. Case 1 was a confirmed, 2.5-cm interstitial pregnancy that failed a multiple-dose methotrexate protocol. Case 2 was an unrecognized interstitial pregnancy that failed single-dose therapy. Case 3 was a rupture of a medically managed interstitial pregnancy despite complete resolution of serum human chorionic gonadotropin. A literature review demonstrated an overall combined failure rate of 35% (7/20). Compared with an isthmic or ampullary pregnancy, a disproportionate number of patients with interstitial pregnancy fail medical management and require emergency surgery. The presence of a documented interstitial pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to medical management. Patients should be counseled that medical management of an interstitial pregnancy may not have the same rate of success as it does in other locations in the fallopian tube. Surgery in this case may be the preferred treatment option."

Patients with clinical evidence of incomplete abortion were not included. We compared ultrasound results with subsequent ultrasound findings by the radiology department and correlated them with follow-up diagnoses and outcomes. Of the 136 eligible patients, a final diagnosis was rendered in 125; 11 were lost to follow-up. These ED ultrasound findings were recorded: established intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) with embryonic structures, 87 (70%); indeterminate scan revealing no distinct evidence of IUP or EP, 15 (12%); early intrauterine gestational sac of less than 6 weeks without embryonic structures, 12 (10%); EP, 8 (6%); blighted ovum, 2 (2%); and molar pregnancy, 1 (1%).

Diagnosis of pregnancy location in these 87 patients effectively ruled out EP, with a negative predictive value of 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of ED ultrasound in the detection of EP were 90% and 88%, respectively. Pelvic ultrasonography performed by emergency physicians can be used to rule out EP and make an accurate diagnosis in most patients with complicated first-trimester pregnancies during the initial ED visit.

The mean initial endometrial stripe thickness of patients eventually diagnosed with an intrauterine pregnancy (13.42 +/- 0.68 mm), spontaneous abortion (9.28 +/- 0.88 mm), and an EP (5.95 +/- 0.35 mm) were all statistically different from each other. Ninety-seven percent of pregnancies found to have an endometrial stripe thickness < or = 8 mm were abnormal (EP or spontaneous abortion). This study suggest a role of the evaluation of the endometrial stripe thickness in the detection of abnormal pregnancies in patients presenting for evaluation of a symptomatic early pregnancy with an hCG below a discriminatory zone. Initial endometrial stripe thickness measured in patients with an EP is significantly thinner than in those with an intrauterine pregnancy."

    "abstract": "To assess the utility of ultrasonography, quantitative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) level, history, and physical examination in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy (EP) in the emergency department. We prospectively studied 481 consecutive pregnant patients who presented to an urban ED with first-trimester abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. History, physical examination findings, quantitative beta-hCG values, sonography findings, surgical findings, and final diagnosis were collected after patient enrollment in the study. We assessed the proportions of pregnant patients experiencing pain or bleeding with EPs versus those with abnormal and normal intrauterine pregnancies (IUPs). Pregnant women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding received beta-hCG values; positive radioimmunoassays prompted ultrasonography; indeterminate ultrasonography findings resulted in admission. Thirteen percent of patients had confirmed EPs; 99.5% of patients discharged from the ED had documented IUPs. Transvaginal sonography in the ED established EP or IUP in 75%. For EP detection, sonography is 69% sensitive and 99% specific. Single beta-hCG levels are useful in predicting EP; a beta-hCG value of 1,000 mIU/mL or lower shows a fourfold higher risk of EP. History and physical examination do not reliably diagnose or rule out EP; of EP patients, 9% reported no pain and 36% lacked adnexal tenderness. To prevent delayed diagnosis of EP in urban centers, pregnant women with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding require evaluation by transvaginal ultrasonography. Indeterminate ultrasonography findings necessitate further evaluation. A beta-hCG level of 1,000 mIU/mL or lower should heighten suspicion of EP."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies can now be recognized very early, and in most cases, before the appearance of dramatic symptoms. This can be attributed mainly to improved diagnostic methods, such as endovaginal sonography and serial determinations of human, chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone. For this reason, extrauterine pregnancies can currently be treated by several methods, and emergency laparotomy is seldom indicated. Advances in treatment modalities, including tubal-conserving operations, laparoscopic approaches, medical treatment with methotrexate, and expectant management have all been proved to be safe and effective. Between January 1994 and June 1995, 166 patients were treated surgically for extrauterine pregnancy. Of these, 94.6% were treated by laparoscopy; laparotomy was required in only 9 (5.4%). Fecundity rates after laparoscopic treatment for ectopic pregnancy are comparable, if not better, than in those treated by laparotomy. Laparoscopic surgery offers advantages, such as reduction in operating time and shorter hospital stay and convalescence, as compared to conventional abdominal surgery. To date, surgical removal of an ectopic pregnancy remains the method of choice and this can be performed safely by laparoscopy."

A retrospective chart review was performed of 50 patients with ectopic pregnancies treated with single-dose methotrexate according to the protocol of Stovall et al. from January 1992 to February 1995. The mean pretreatment level of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin was 1896.4 +/- 2399 mlU/ml. Only 32 women (64%) were successfully treated with a single dose of methotrexate. An additional 7 women required a second or third injection. The combined success rate for medical management of ectopic pregnancy with one to three doses of methotrexate was 78% (39 women). Pretreatment beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels were significantly lower in women who responded to single-dose therapy than in those who required either two or three doses or who had failure of medical management (p = 0.0011). The mean time to resolution of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin was 26.5 +/- 17 days. Higher pretreatment levels correlated with longer resolution time (r = 0.83, p < 0.001). Eleven women (22%) with failure of medical management required surgery. In our series single-dose methotrexate was only 64% successful. Women with a pretreatment beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level >5000 mlU/ml had a greater probability of requiring either surgical intervention or multiple doses of methotrexate. The potential for emergency surgery remains an important risk."

There were 144 cases of ectopic pregnancies from a total of 12,507 deliveries; this corresponds to 11 cases of ectopic pregnancies for 1,000 deliveries. In 75 cases (52%) the patients were operated in emergency situations with clinical signs of ruptured ectopic pregnancy which were later confirmed at laparotomy. In 69 cases (47.9%) the patients were retained in hospital for definitive diagnosis and in the follow-up, the diagnosis was confirmed by laparoscopy in 37 cases (53.6%) and by ultrasonography in 22 cases (31.9%). In this study the frequency of ectopic pregnancy was most common among primiparous women (36 cases) and second parity (37 cases). The highest frequency of ectopic pregnancies was found in women in the age range between 25 and 30 years. Radical treatment of ectopic pregnancy was performed in 62 cases (43.0%) and conservative treatment in 82 cases (56.9%). The main complication during the operation was represented by severe hemorrhage in 65 cases (45.1%); blood transfusion was required in 25 cases. Among the patients who were followed up in the prenatal clinic (98 cases) 16 patients (16.3%) presented an intra-uterine pregnancy and 12 patients (12.2%) a recurrence of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is a frequent pathology in Cameroon. In the absence of methods for early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy such as endovaginal ultrasonography and the measurement of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG), primary use of laparotomy is necessary when clinical signs of ectopic pregnancy exist. This procedure permits the avoidance of severe complications such as hemorrhage and maternal death. It can be said that laparotomy still has its place in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy in developing countries."

Emergency physicians who had completed a training program performed EVS on a convenience sample of eligible women. Clinical disposition was based on predetermined clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic criteria. The EVS examinations were reviewed on video by a gynecologist whose interpretation was correlated with the emergency physician EVS readings and with the final clinical diagnoses. Quantitative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta hCG) levels were determined for patients who had no definite intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) on EVS. Of 152 patients studied during a 12-month period, four were lost to follow-up. Emergency physician ultrasonographic diagnoses included: definite IUP, 87/148 (59%); probable abnormal IUP, 17/148 (11%); definite ectopic pregnancy, 3/148 (2%); and no definite IUP, 41/148 (28%). The gynecologist agreed with 93% of the initial interpretations. Twelve of 16 patients who had the final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy were admitted from the ED with this diagnosis. The ultrasonographic diagnosis of the other four was no definite IUP, and no mass or free fluid. For the latter four patients, the presenting serum beta hCG level was < 2,000 mIU/mL (First International Reference Preparation). They were diagnosed as having ectopic pregnancy after serial outpatient EVS and beta hCG measurements. The application of EVS to emergency practice appears promising. Emergency physicians trained in its use and who apply this diagnostic tool in conjunction with a defined protocol can stratify the risk of patients who have the potential for ectopic pregnancy."

A standard questionnaire relating to history, examination, immediate investigations and preliminary diagnosis was completed by the attending A&E doctor. The cause of abdominal pain, according to the A&E doctor's diagnosis, was gynaecological in 61%, gastroenterological in 23%, urological in 7% and non-specific in 9% of cases. Of the women, 39% (124/322) were referred to a duty specialist, of whom 86% (107/124) required admission for investigation and/or treatment. Women initially diagnosed as having pain of gynaecological origin formed the largest group of patients to be referred. In 69% (67/97) of these cases, the A&E doctor's initial diagnosis was confirmed by the gynaecologist. This study shows that pain of gynaecological origin was the largest single cause of lower abdominal pain in women presenting to our A&E department and that, in the majority of cases, these women needed to be referred to the duty gynaecologist for immediate treatment. Although overall diagnostic accuracy rate was relatively high, the management of potentially life-threatening gynaecological conditions such as ectopic pregnancy was poor. These results emphasise the need to improve in-service gynaecological training in A&E departments."

The 40 patients were hospitalised for an average of 1.4 days and 24 stayed one night only. There was no difference in operating time between registrars and consultants. The only major complication was a patient who required an emergency laparotomy because of continued bleeding. When all cases of ectopic surgery were evaluated in the second year, six of the 32 cases required laparotomy to complete the operation. The benefits of laparoscopic surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy dictate that this should be employed as first line treatment for all cases of tubal ectopic gestation.

Several hundreds of such compounds have been synthesized, but only a few of them have been evaluated to any significant extent in biological screening models and, to our knowledge, only three compounds, namely mifepristone, lilopristone (ZK 98.734) and onapristone (ZK 98.299) have been given to humans. Most of the clinical research to date has focused on the use of mifepristone given in combination with prostaglandin for termination of early pregnancy, an indication for which the compound is being used routinely in four countries so far, i.e. China, France, the UK and Sweden. The gynaecological and obstetrical applications in which antiprogestogens have been shown to be of value to date include ripening of the pregnant cervix prior to pregnancy termination, sensitization of the uterus to prostaglandins in second-trimester abortion, and induction of labour. Available data suggest that antiprogestogens have no place in the conservative treatment of ectopic pregnancy or in the treatment of premenstrual tension. In fertility regulation, the sequential combination regimen of mifepristone plus prostaglandin as used for inducing abortion has proved to be effective also for menses induction and can be expected to be an efficacious once-a-month contraceptive. Mifepristone alone, without adjuvant prostaglandin, has yielded promising results as an anti-implantation agent and in emergency contraception. Other potential uses include once-a-week contraception, ovulation inhibition (in a sequential regimen with a progestogen), and as a daily mini-pill. Mifepristone, and other antiprogestogens for which biological data have been reported also bind to the cellular receptors for glucocorticoid hormones and, consequently, possess antiglucocorticoid in addition to their antiprogestational activity. Because of this antiglucocorticoid effect, mifepristone has been employed successfully in the palliative treatment of hypercortisolism due to Cushing's syndrome, and its use has been proposed for treating certain forms of depression and of glaucoma, and in wound healing. However, for scientific and practical reasons, it would be preferable if molecules were developed that have only the antiprogestational or the antiglucocorticoid activity rather than both."

Although the patient's sonogram was negative for an intrauterine pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy could not be ruled out and the patient was taken to surgery, where no evidence of pregnancy was found. Retrospective evaluation of the patient's medical history revealed that she had 30 previous surgical procedures, for which most were performed for alleged gynecological reasons. The authors suggest that this case of Munchausen's syndrome illustrates one of the more interesting solutions for a \"laboratory error.\""

    "abstract": "To evaluate quantitative hCG measurements and transvaginal ultrasound in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in patients presenting to the emergency department. A discriminatory zone for detecting the presence or absence of an intrauterine pregnancy by transvaginal ultrasound was established prospectively. Women presenting to the emergency department were evaluated prospectively using a diagnostic algorithm consisting of clinical examination, quantitative serum hCG, and transvaginal ultrasound. Finally, ectopic pregnancies diagnosed over a 22-month period were evaluated prospectively. All viable intrauterine pregnancies were identified in those subjects with hCG levels of 1500 mIU/mL (First International Reference) or greater. One thousand two hundred sixty-three subjects were evaluated prospectively; 59.8% were diagnosed with intrauterine pregnancy, 26.8% with spontaneous abortion, and 7.8% with ectopic pregnancy. At presentation, 13.2% of intrauterine pregnancies were diagnosed by clinical examination, whereas 82.9% were diagnosed by transvaginal ultrasound. Only 4% of normal intrauterine pregnancies were not confirmed on initial visit. Of 205 ectopic pregnancies diagnosed, 81.5% were hemodynamically stable; of these, 49.1% were diagnosed on initial presentation. Of all ectopics, 59% never reached an hCG level of 1500 mIU/mL and 35.8% had an hCG lower than the level at presentation. This protocol diagnosed ectopic pregnancies with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99.9%. A protocol of quantitative hCG levels (available within hours of presentation to an emergency department) combined with transvaginal ultrasound is effective in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy."

A 25-year-old patient who conceived after ovulation induction was treated conservatively for mild ovarian hyperstimulation and threatened abortion. She subsequently underwent selective first-trimester multifetal reduction and was admitted and treated for suspected pelvic infection. On the 17th post-procedure morning, ovarian torsion was diagnosed using color Doppler ultrasonography. Because gynecologists face serious management dilemmas when confronted with ovarian torsion, this technique of using color Doppler ultrasonography should provide a highly specific finding in complete ovarian torsion, aiding the clinician in prompt diagnosis and treatment."

The incidence appears to be of 1 to 3 per cent of all ectopic gestations with a frequency of one in 7000 to 40000 deliveries and it is now believed to occur four times more frequently than previously thought. It has been suggested that the increasing incidence is caused by the use of IUD. In contrast to patients with tubal pregnancy traditional risk factors such as pelvic inflammatory disease, prior surgical procedure upon the pelvis may not apply. The clinical signs are similar to those found in tubal pregnancies and in hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts. The treatment is emergency laparatomy followed by oophorectomy in many instances. When the patient is hemodynamically stable laparoscopy and the ovarian wedge resection should be the treatment of choice."

This report describes an unusual case of bilateral multicystic ovaries occurring in an adult patient with profound hypothyroidism. A 26-year-old woman presented with an acute abdomen and bilateral adnexal masses. An emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed bilateral enlarged multicystic ovaries with torsion of the right ovary. Because this ovary was necrotic, it was removed; pathology revealed multiple hemorrhagic follicular cysts. Laboratory studies to evaluate the cause of the multicystic ovaries revealed negative serum beta-hCG, LH 0.7 IU/L, FSH 15.7 IU/L, and estradiol 80 pg/mL. The TSH value was greater than 50 IU/L and serum thyroxine was undetectable, demonstrating profound hypothyroidism. Subsequent thyroid hormone replacement was associated with resolution of the cysts in the remaining ovary. Profound hypothyroidism can cause multicystic ovaries in an adult. In the absence of ovarian torsion, surgery can be avoided, as thyroid hormone replacement leads to clinical resolution of the cysts within 3 months."

In short, it could be determined that the mock patient was sexually active, did not use contraception, was \"late\" for her period, and had just begun spotting. With the information available, a potentially life-threatening ectopic pregnancy could not be ruled out. Telephone triage of 35 clinics was evaluated according to the final disposition. Appropriate advice included arranging to see the patient that day or referring the patient to another facility (i.e., emergency department) to be seen that day. Sixty-three percent of the clinics gave appropriate advice; 37% gave inappropriate advice. Nonprofessional personnel rendered the advice in over 60% of the calls.

Ectopic or tubal pregnancy is difficult to diagnose in emergency rooms. With the objective of finding better hCG-related assays for differentiating tubal and normal pregnancies, we tested 2 hCG, 1 free beta-subunit and 2 beta-core fragment immunoassays. Twelve urine samples were collected in the emergency room from women later shown by surgery to have tubal pregnancy. All were 38 to 80 days since last period. A further 36 urine samples were collected from the same period from those with normal intrauterine pregnancies. Using the 2 hCG assays the median level in tubal pregnancy samples was 1/38th and 1/48th of normal pregnancy concentrations. With the free beta-subunit assay tubal pregnancy levels were 1/28th of normal levels. Using 2 beta-core fragment assays (Ciba-Triton UGP kit and B204-FBT11 scavenger test), however, tubal levels were most different from intrauterine pregnancy, 1/149th and 1/800th of normal levels. A cut-off level of 100 micrograms/L was considered for the B204-FBT11 beta-core fragment test, at which a predictive value of > 98% was suggested for ectopic pregnancy. In an additional patient, levels were measured 15 days prior to the diagnosis of tubal pregnancy. At this time, results from the 2 hCG tests were 1/97th and 1/126th, from the free beta-subunit test was 1/8th and the 2 beta-core assays were 1/413th and 1/240th of median normal intrauterine pregnancy levels. While hCG levels are reduced in tubal pregnancy, beta-core fragment are reduced much further. beta-core fragment measurements may offer a major improvement over hCG in diagnosing tubal pregnancy in the Emergency Room, and in screening for this life threatening disease."

    "abstract": "The topic of this article is the use of unsafe abortion for unwanted pregnancies among adolescents. The significance of unsafe abortion is identified as a high risk of serious health problems, such as infection, hemorrhage, infertility, and mortality, and as a strain on emergency room services. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 33% of all women seeking hospital care for abortion complications are aged under 20 years. 50 million abortions are estimated to be induced annually, of which 33% are illegal and almost 50% are performed outside the health care system. Complications are identified as occurring due to the procedure itself (perforation of the uterus, cervical lacerations, or hemorrhage) and due to incomplete abortion or introduction of bacteria into the uterus. Long-term complications include an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic infection, and infertility. Mortality from unsafe abortion is estimated at 1000/100,000 procedures. Safe abortion mortality is estimated at 0.6/100,000. When infertility results, some cultures ascribe an outcast status or marriages are prevented or prostitution is assured. The risk of complications is considered higher for adolescents. Adolescents tend to delay seeking an abortion, lack knowledge on where to go for a safe procedure, and delay seeking help for complications. Peer advice may be limited or inadequate knowledge. Five studies are cited that illustrate the impact of unsafe abortion on individuals and health care systems. Abortions may be desired due to fear of parental disapproval of the pregnancy, abandonment by the father, financial and emotional responsibilities of child rearing, expulsion from school, or inability to marry if the child is out of wedlock. Medical, legal, and social barriers may prevent women and girls from obtaining safe abortion. Parental permission is sometimes a requirement for safe abortion. Fears of judgmental or callous health personnel may be barriers to seeking safe abortion. Some countries lack adequately trained medical personnel and supplies. Mortality and morbidity declines are considered possible with legalization, more trained health personnel, and family planning programs for youth and education for parents."

Ectopic pregnancy should be the presumptive diagnosis when clinical presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy especially in the first trimester. Patients who are pregnant and exhibit clinical signs and symptoms that are consistent with salpingitis should be admitted for aggressive management of their high-risk pregnancy.

As a result of the failure to appreciate the possibility of ectopic pregnancy after tubal ligation, right-sided abdominal pain in this patient population is commonly misdiagnosed as appendicitis. One such case is presented, and the literature is reviewed and discussed. Sterilization by tubal occlusive methods is not always successful. This fact is not, however, well recognized among general surgeons. When failures occur, ectopic pregnancy is the usual outcome, most commonly in the Fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy has a reported mortality of approximately 3.5/1000, with the majority of deaths associated with delay in diagnosis. The failure to consider this possibility of ectopic pregnancy after tubal ligation when female patients present with right-sided abdominal pain causes health personnel to commonly misdiagnose the condition of appendicitis. A 26 year old woman presented to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Royal Hobart Hospital with lower abdominal pain mainly in the right iliac fossa. Pain was intermittent for two weeks prior to presentation. On the morning of presentation, the pain became severe and was exacerbated by coughing and movements. The patient was nauseated, but had not vomited; there was neither fever nor rigors. Four years earlier, in England, the patient had undergone elective laparoscopic sterilization. Sexually active, she believed that she was menstruating at the time of presentation, especially since her last menstruation occurred four weeks previously. The patient was noted upon examination to have a \"grey look,\" pulse rate of 80 beats/minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and a generally tender abdomen, maximally in the right iliac fossa. There were no bowel sounds and rectal examination proved to be extremely painful in all directions. The accident and emergency staff took blood for a full blood count, serum human chorionic gonadotrophin, and arranged surgical consultation. The surgical diagnosis was for acute appendicitis and the patient was transferred to the operating theater for appendectomy. Just prior to anesthetic induction, the pathology results became available, indicating a hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dl and a positive serum HCG. The diagnosis was thus revised to ruptured ectopic pregnancy and laparotomy was performed through a Pfannenstiel incision. 1000 ml of blood was removed from the peritoneal cavity, a ruptured tubal pregnancy was found in the right distal tube, and the appendix was normal. A right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed after which the patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged five days postoperatively. Histopathology confirmed a ruptured ectopic gestation."

Large-scale trials have documented the advantages of the techniques in terms of operative time, hospitalization, and convalescence, although the risk for retained trophoblast may be increased. Systemic medical treatment with methotrexate is effective in approximately 95% of cases. In addition, minimally invasive methods such as local medical therapy have been designed: transabdominal, transvaginal, and transuterine injection of compounds such as prostaglandins, methotrexate, and hyperosmolar glucose. So far, large-scale, randomized trials are lacking and the techniques should still be considered investigational."

To determine the value of these estimations in the prediction of early pregnancy loss, frequency distribution curves and receiver operating characteristic curves were derived for the respective hormones measured at weeks 4-7 of gestation and expressed as multiples of the median (MoM) values in pregnancies occurring both with and without ovarian stimulation. A cut-off level of beta-HCG less than 0.5 MoM gave a sensitivity of 68% with an odds ratio of 4.0 at 7 weeks in unstimulated cycles in the prediction of pregnancy failure. A cut-off of 0.8 MoM for progesterone gave a sensitivity of 59% and an odds ratio of 2.8. Prospective hormonal monitoring during the early weeks of gestation may be useful in the prediction of early pregnancy loss and should help to avoid the emergency presentation of some of the complications of early pregnancy, in particular ectopic pregnancy. The limitations imposed by multiple pregnancies and uncertain gestation due to menstrual data may restrict the use of this strategy to specialist fertility centres."

She had intercourse 1 week before coming to the emergency facility. She had widespread tenderness in her abdomen, especially in the lower areas. Blood cell studies suggested an infection. The attending physician presumed her to have pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as a result of either sexual intercourse or the elective abortion. The physician called for a urinary beta human chorionic gonadotropin test to determine whether placental tissue remained in the uterus. It was positive. 60 minutes after admission, the supine patient's pain increased and her blood pressure dropped to 80/50 mm Hg from 100/60 mm Hg at admission. After administering Ringer's solution, the health team sat her up and she fainted. A repeat cell count indicated sepsis. Her blood pressure decreased to 60 by Doppler and the physician continued to give her fluids and began dopamine. After the team stabilized her, they transferred her to a hospital. Her private physician examined her and then began surgery. The physician found a tubal pregnancy and removed the affected tube and ovary. She recuperated completely. Combined intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy occurs once in every 30,000 cases. Previous PID, use of ovulation inducing medication, and in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer increases the likelihood of this type of pregnancy occurring. Physicians should consider this possibility if a woman has any of these histories and a combination of abdominal pain, adnexal mass with pain and tenderness, peritoneal irritation, and an enlarged uterus."

    "abstract": "Rate of ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening pathology with great psycho-social significance, had reached from 4.5 per miles in 1970 up to 16.8 per miles in 1987. During a nine-year period (1980-1988) 466 women with diagnosis ectopic pregnancy were hospitalized in the Department of Urgent Gynaecology-Emergent Medical Institute \"Pirogov\". Married were 285 (61.16%) of them, not married--116 (24.89%) and divorced--65 (13.95%). Dull, not localized pain was observed in 300 (64.38%) of them. In 160 (34.33%) only colics were observed, dated from 15 days to 1 month before hospitalization. The classic triad of amenorrhea, colicky pains in the lower abdomen and bloody liquids, running out of genitalia. When hospitalized, 194 women (41.63%) were in very severe general condition, from these 92 in severe hemorrhagic shock. The blood loss, evaluated in the beginning of the operation was found to be: 0 ml--8 patients (1.72%); up to 300 ml--143 (30.69%); up to 600 ml--121 women (25.97%); up to 1000 ml--102 (21.88%); up to 1500 ml--36 (7.73%); up to 2000 ml--36 patients (7.73%); up to 3000 ml--17 (3.65%); more than 3000 ml--3 (0.64%). A conclusion was made that it is necessary to improve the prophylaxis, the diagnostic methods and the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, so as to save reproductive abilities of the women."

The local rate of ectopic pregnancy was similar to that seen in other UK studies. Nineteen (13%) women with ectopic pregnancies were sent home with an incorrect diagnosis. Eight were recalled but eight required emergency admission and one died at home. Undue confidence in ultrasound reports and failure to follow up inconclusive histology results were a feature in cases where patients were not recalled. A set of simple management guidelines has been drawn up. Amongst general gynaecological admissions 1 in 12 of all first trimester complications was an ectopic pregnancy. Amongst apparently true uterine miscarriages 20% of histological examinations were inconclusive and histology and ultrasound examinations failed to confirm a uterine miscarriage in 14% of apparently true missed miscarriages. Ectopic pregnancy is common amongst first trimester complications. Adherence to simple management guidelines would minimize the number of patients requiring emergency admission, though up to 20% of patients with apparently true uterine miscarriages would also require further investigation."

    "title": "Emergency contraception.",
    "abstract": "Although emergency postcoital contraception has been available since 1974, there has been no demonstrable impact on the rate of induced abortion. This reflects both a lack of awareness of this form of pregnancy prevention, on the part of patients and physicians, and misconceptions that postcoital contraception must be administered \"the morning after\" to be effective. At present, 2 such types of contraception are available. A pill containing 100 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 500 mcg of levonorgestrel is administered in 2 doses, the 1st of which must occur within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse or condom failure. The overall reported pregnancy rate associated with this method is about 1%/woman-cycle. There is no evidence that the emergency pill affects organogenesis or increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy; however, most women who seek postcoital contraception are highly motivated to avoid pregnancy and abort in cases of pill failure. The 2nd method, an emergency IUD, must be inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. The failure rate of this method is only 0.04%/woman-cycle. Since both these agents prevent implantation, they are not considered abortifacients. RU-486, which can terminate a pregnancy of under 63 days' gestation, may in the future gain approval for use as an emergency contraceptive. Physicians are urged to talk to patients about steps to take if contraception is forgotten or fails (as in the event of a broken condom) well in advance of an emergency. In addition, reception staff should be alerted that women seeking emergency appointments may be in need of postcoital contraception and may not be able to wait several days to be seen."

These pregnancies tend to progress further before rupture than do other tubal pregnancies and subsequently have greater propensity for massive intra-abdominal bleeding and maternal demise. Abdominal ultrasound can be deceptive in evaluating interstitial ectopic pregnancies. Transvaginal ultrasonography is more sensitive in the diagnosis of early ectopic pregnancy. Knowledge of the application and limitations of both transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound will assist the emergency physician in the timely evaluation of this potentially lethal condition."

All 12 women with ectopic pregnancy had a positive test result, although urinary concentration varied from 191 IU/l to 47,800 IU/l. Only one woman, who had a faintly positive result, was found not to be pregnant on subsequent examination. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of the urine test were 100% respectively. 33 women were sent home from the accident and emergency department with normal clinical findings after a negative urine test result. All these women had undetectable concentrations of chorionic gonadotrophin in matched samples of urine and serum. A simple, rapid one step test for chorionic gonadotrophin should be available for the initial evaluation of emergency gynaecological problems. The additional cost of the test is offset by not admitting those patients whose clinical findings are normal and who have a negative urine test result and by reducing the number of women requiring quantitative assays of chorionic gonadotrophin."

In Saudi Arabia during 1978-80 obstetric hemorrhage was the major cause of a maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 52/100,000 live births. 25% of deaths are attributable to obstetric hemorrhage caused by PPH, placenta previa, placental abruption, and ectopic pregnancy. In Egypt during 1970-78 PPH caused 52% of a total of 10,362 pregnancy related deaths; while during 1979-82 PPH accounted for 38.2% of 5355 such deaths. In Menoufia Governorate, Egypt, MMR reached 190/100,000 with 35.3% caused by hemorrhage over 1/2 of which were caused by PPH. In a major hospital during 1984-88 with a MMR rate of 103.4/100,000 hemorrhage accounted for 40% of 27 deaths and 27% of these were caused by PPH. The contributory factors of PPH include the low socioeconomic status of Egyptian women (illiteracy rate of 50.8% in 1988); the high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among pregnant women (22.1% according to a survey during 1978-80 and even reaching 56.9% of hospital admissions); prenatal checkup of only 1 in 2 cases (5% of rural and 27% of urban births); only 23% of deliveries occurred in hospitals and 60% of all deliveries were assisted by traditional birth attendants; and high parity (women aged 45-49 averaged 6.4 births). A 1988 survey indicated that 12% of married women were pregnant, and 62.2% were not using contraceptives. The mismanagement of PPH cases often caused high morbidity and mortality. Health services were sometimes underutilized (antenatal visits decreased during 1982-87); primary health care training of doctors was inadequate; rural referrals of PPH cases was deficient; emergency facilities and equipment were lacking, and more ample blood supplies for transfusions were needed. The health information and registration system also requires improvement for more accurate morbidity and mortality data registration."

    "abstract": "To identify the most significant determinants of maternal mortality in Kenya, a prospective study involving 49,335 deliveries occurring at Kenyatta National Hospital from January 1978-87 was conducted. There were 156 maternal deaths in this series, for a maternal mortality rate of 3.2/1000 deliveries. The 5 most frequent causes of death were abortion (24%), hypertensive disease of pregnancy (13%), sepsis (13%), anemia (10%), and cardiac disease (7%). 24% of women who died were age 19 years or under, 27% were 20-24 years, 23% were 25-29 years, and 11% were 30-34 years. The largest percentage (24%) of deaths involved nulliparous women; 16% were to women of parity 5 and above. 28% of the women who died were single, and single women contributed the majority of deaths from abortion. 66% of the women who died had received no prenatal care. The proportion of avoidable deaths was 19% among clinic attenders compared to 29% among non-attenders. Overall, age, parity, and marital status--traditionally regarded as the key factors associated with maternal mortality--vary in their impact, given the cause of death and medical services received. The assumption that high parity is associated with maternal mortality was not confirmed in this study due to the significant number of deaths from abortion that involved single, nulliparous women. In addition, many women who died were in the optimum age group for childbearing, but were more prone to suffer from anemia, hypertension, ectopic pregnancy, and cardiac disease than women over 30 years old. Overall, 126 deaths were considered avoidable. Contributory factors were slowness of surgical management of emergencies, prolonged confinement of women with cardiac disease, and a lack of emergency supplies of blood and drugs for complicated deliveries."

Twenty-four out of 26 ectopic pregnancies were correctly diagnosed on admission, combining results of the two techniques, the sensitivity of the two techniques used separately being 88.4% (transvaginal) and 76.9% (transabdominal). In our unselected symptomatic patients, the transvaginal technique showed to be advantageous but not essential in the management of ectopic pregnancy. The surgical outcome of these patients suggested that a prompt diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy did not warrant a conservative treatment."

    "abstract": "As a result of experience with more than 16,000 pelviscopic operative procedures performed at the Kiel University Women's Clinic from 1971 to 1988 which in this time had been adapted and used around the world, it may be said that the pelviscopic operative techniques, based completely on the laparotomy techniques which employ the microscissors, needles and suture material, is superior for many of the classical gynecological indications to operation. Minimally invasive surgery reduces hospitalization for even the most difficult cases to approximately 3 days. Convalescence is also reduced to approximately 1 week. Postoperative complaints are few, particularly when the primary exudate is removed through an abdominal drain. Late complications are practically unknown. It must be said that even the most minimal of operative procedures can produce late postoperative complaints or can be ascribed as the source of late postoperative complaints. Experiences gathered from around the world with endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery have shown that for some gynecological procedures laparotomy is now indicated only in the rare case. The leading example of this switch can be seen in the operative treatment of the ectopic pregnancy. Following closely are operations to correct sterility such as salpingolysis, ovariolysis, fimbrioplasty, and salpingostomy. Finally pelviscopic treatment is increasing for all benign ovarian tumors, and the enucleation of myomas of up to 400 grams in weight. Endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery also has a place in the field of general abdominal surgery--that of treatment of chronic abdominal adhesions. These procedures in the future should basically commence with endoscopic adhesiolysis, the patient having had the proper preoperative bowel preparation. Because of this minimally invasive technique the surgeon will only rarely be forced to perform laparotomy. In the case of abdominal adhesions a prerequisite for pelviscopic treatment is the visually controlled perforation of the peritoneum. Endoscopic surgery, in contrast to open laparoscopy, has a large periumbilical radius of action and produces no postoperative scars. In Kiel operative pelviscopy has replaced 80% of the classic gynecological laparotomies. The recurrence rate of adhesions is 84% with laparotomy compared with a recurrence rate of less than 40% with postendoscopic adhesiolysis. Forty to sixty percent of the patients who underwent pelviscopic adhesiolysis are complaint-free; this is a result not attained with classical abdominal surgery. Adhesiolysis per laparotomy is now limited to the emergency situation, as in the cases of ileus, for example. Endoscopically guided intraabdominal surgery has now improved the quality of life for surgical patients."

All ED patients with a positive urine pregnancy test treated between January 1 and December 31, 1988. Screening history, physical examination, and serum progesterone (P) and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) titer. All discharged patients were given follow-up appointments within two weeks; those found to have a P less than 25 ng/mL were called to return for repeat hCG and transvaginal ultrasound. One hundred sixty-one of 2,157 patients (7.5%) with a positive urine pregnancy test were found to have an ectopic pregnancy. All but five had a P of less than 25 ng/mL (sensitivity, 97%); four of these were admitted for immediate surgery because of symptoms. Overall, the ED physician detected 89 of 161 ectopics (55.3%) on initial presentation, 53 (60%) of which were ruptured at the time of surgery. Seventy-two patients (44.7%) who were discharged but later found to have an ectopic pregnancy had benign clinical presentations, including 41 with vaginal bleeding. There were no statistically significant differences in the presenting symptoms of patients with unruptured ectopics compared with normal intrauterine pregnancies. All but one of the 72 discharged patients were noted the following day to have a progesterone of less than 25 ng/mL and contacted to return. Eight of these were found to have a ruptured ectopic at the time of surgery. Only 91 of 161 patients (56.5%) with ectopic pregnancy acknowledged one or more clinical risk factors on follow-up questioning. The standard history and physical examination, including those performed by gynecologic specialists, are insufficiently sensitive for early detection of unruptured ectopic pregnancy. EDs with a high incidence of ectopic pregnancy should strongly consider implementation of a universal progesterone screening program to decrease unnecessary patient morbidity and the risk of mortality from undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy."

Barriers to obtaining legal abortions are identified and the harsh experiences of women seeking treatment for complications of illegally induced abortion are discussed. The data contribute to an understanding of the intensity of abortion for Zambian women and draw attention to the value of small-scale, qualitative research on women's reproductive health care needs. It is suggested that a study be planned at UTH to determine how health care delivery can be improved for women who seek abortion. This report describes qualitative observations of the 1 day at the Gynecological Emergency Ward, University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, for September, 1988; and 2 case histories of abortion patients. These women had complications of illegally induced incomplete abortions. They came to the (UTH) for medical treatment. Each day 3 out of 10 illegally induced abortion patients complete the abortions on a concrete floor with no medical care. No medication or analgesics can be given without a prescription by a physician. If it is determined that a woman has had a proper, complete abortion, she is observed for at least 8 hours and released. Only 1 physician is available to many women. Due to blood shortages, few women who need blood get it. Women who have abortion- related infections need antibiotics which they may or may not get. Hysterectomy, ectopic pregnancy, and sterility are complications of improperly performed abortions. The consent of 3 physicians is required for an abortion--1 must be a specialist in a branch of medicine related to the woman's reason for wanting an abortion. Physicians are reluctant to schedule appointments despite the legalization of abortion in 1972. Junior physicians perform the abortions in the operating room. Some private physicians insert an IUD to induce abortion and tell the women to go to the gynecology ward at the hospital when bleeding begins. Other private doctors insert a plastic cannula and tell the women to go to the hospital ward. Most women go to traditional healers or midwives who insert roots soaked in water into the cervix which act as an irritant/dilator. Traditional healers also provide herbs claimed to be abortifacients which are taken in tea or eaten. At least 114 of the women at UTH induce abortion themselves by inserting plants or twigs into the cervix. Desperate and often the youngest women drink gasoline or detergents or take large overdoses of chloroquine, aspirin, or other toxic substances. All the women are afraid of dying from abortions. Poorly performed abortion is a major cause if maternal mortality in the 3rd world. Abortion-related death rates have been guessed to be 50- 100/100,000 illegal procedures compared to 1/100,000 legal abortions in the US. A study should be planned at UTH to determine how health care delivery can be improved for abortion seekers."

Six patients without an ectopic pregnancy underwent unnecessary laparotomy because of positive culdocentesis test results, whereas 27 patients who were discharged from the emergency room after negative test results were obtained subsequently were found to have ectopic pregnancies.

Of these, 1648 (41%) were noted to be pregnant, initially detected by rapid enzyme immunoassay for urinary human chorionic gonadotropin, and later confirmed using quantitative radioimmunoassay for serum human chorionic gonadotropin. Within this group, 249 women were diagnosed with ectopic pregnancies. Hemoperitoneum was discovered by culdocentesis in 128 of 249 cases of ectopic gestations, all operated upon acutely. A discriminatory zone for ultrasound was diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy in only 33 cases, as the majority of women presented with human chorionic gonadotropin levels below 6500 mIU/ml. Uterine curettage performed when abnormal serial levels of chorionic gonadotropin were observed detected an additional 46 cases. Early diagnosis permitted treatment prior to tubal rupture in 147 instances with conservation of the fallopian tube in 125 (50%). We conclude: (1) even in a busy county emergency room, algorithms are useful for expediting the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy; (2) when ectopics are diagnosed early, conservative tubal surgery is possible in many patients."

Because of its simple interpretation and 24-hour maximum delay, we conclude that the determination of serum progesterone should be used for ectopic pregnancy screening in all patients at risk for ectopic pregnancy, or at any time when the diagnosis is in question."

    "abstract": "This report describes an individualized, reduced dose, methotrexate (MTX) and citrovorum factor (CF) treatment regimen for outpatient management of unruptured ectopic pregnancy (EP). One hundred sixteen laparoscopically documented EPs, the majority (90%) of whom were symptomatic, were diagnosed from an Emergency Department population. Eighty of 116 (69%) were unruptured, 37 (46.3%) of whom were eligible for MTX-CF chemotherapy. One patient refused chemotherapy. Thirty-four of the 36 (94.4%) patients treated with MTX-CF had complete resolution of their ectopics, whereas 2 experienced rupture after chemotherapy, 1 of them 23 days after MTX initiation. While there were no major chemotherapy-related side effects, 3 of the 36 (8.3%) patients experienced minor side effects. The authors conclude that: (1) individualized dosing of outpatient MTX-CF chemotherapy for symptomatic EP can be safely managed, even in an indigent population; (2) rupture can occur up to 23 days after chemotherapy initiation; (3) fetal cardiac activity is an absolute contraindication to chemotherapy; (4) chemotherapy in patients with symptoms is of limited value because the disease is too far advanced; therefore, it is essential that the diagnosis of EP be established before symptom onset; and (5) chemotherapy offers no significant immediate advantages to outpatient laparoscopic surgery. However, increasingly reliable nonlaparoscopic diagnosis will soon give wider application to this approach."

    "abstract": "Experience gathered during the last 20 years in the treatment of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is presented. Fifty-eight cases were treated at the Karolinska Hospital during the period of 1966-86. This number accounts for approximately 50% of the cases in Sweden during this period of time. Thirty-four patients developed their malignancy after a molar pregnancy. Thirty-three patients were nonmetastatic and of the 25 metastatic cases, 6 patients were staged to a high-risk group. Chemotherapy was given to all patients except one who had a primary choriocarcinoma in an ectopic pregnancy. Surgery was performed in elective cases or when chemotherapy failed. Surgical procedures were also performed in a few emergency situations. Since 1978 all patients were started on methotrexate--folinic acid ad modum Goldstein. When this medication failed, either the CHAMOMA (vincristine, methotrexate--folinic acid, actinomycin D, melphalan, adriamycin) or later the EMA/CA (etoposide, methotrexate--folinic acid, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin) regimen ad modum Bagshawe was given. An overall remission rate of 96.5% was achieved. The minimum period of follow-up was 2 years. The 2 patients who died (in 1966 and 1982) were referred to our department in a late stage. Five patients had a late recurrence and all but one were successfully treated."

Histological examination confirmed an ectopic pregnancy in 60 women (24%); in seven a live fetus was observed outside the uterus allowing a confident diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy; in 27 the thickness of the endometrium was greater than 10 mm (sensitivity 50%, specificity 84%, positive predictive value 28%, negative predictive value 87%); in 15 the uterine area measurement was less than 20 cm2 (sensitivity 72%, specificity 41%, positive predictive value 20%, negative predictive value 79%); and 43 had an adnexal mass volume greater than 10 ml separate from the ovary (sensitivity 85%, specificity 37%, positive predictive value 23%, negative predictive value 90%). Only three had negative ultrasound findings. The negative predictive value of an ultrasound examination could be increased to 96% by using a combination of these ultrasound features. The addition of hCG (greater than 25 i.u./l) improved the specificity to 98% and the negative predictive value to 100%. These criteria may improve the ultrasound diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy."

Surgery revealed ovarian torsion in seven of these cases and hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in one case. A cystic or complex ovarian mass was detected by sonography in five additional cases, and ovarian torsion was included in the differential diagnosis. Surgery revealed ovarian torsion in four of these cases and hemorrhagic ovarian cyst in one. A 100% sonographic sensitivity for space-occupying disease of the ovary was obtained with a positive predictive value of 88% for the diagnosis of ovarian torsion. The specificity of the method was 93%. Sonography appears to be an excellent method to evaluate patients with suspected torsion of the ovary."

In patients with a pregnancy-related gynaecologic emergency PAPP-A was undetectable in 82% of the ectopic pregnancies and in 55% of the intrauterine abortions. Considering the frequency of ectopic pregnancy (35.8%) and intrauterine abortion (52.3%) among all patients with pregnancy-related disorders, the likelihood that a pregnant patient with undectable PAPP-A has an ectopic pregnancy is 30%, and intrauterine abortion is 29%. These results indicate that although PAPP-A levels in ectopic pregnancy and intrauterine abortion are lower than in normal pregnancy, PAPP-A measurement cannot be used to distinguish between ectopic pregnancy and intrauterine abortion."

Furthermore, 6 of 35 patients with noninfectious disorders (ovarian cyst, uterine fibroid, unexplained pelvic pains) had slightly elevated (12-59 mg/l) CRP levels. Thus, in this series a CRP greater than 10 mg/l had good sensitivity (93%) and specificity (83%) in the diagnosis of PID.

However, there were no cases of intrauterine gestational sacs. The incidence of patients who exhibited over 500g of intraperitoneal hemorrhage were decreased by using UST (non-UST group: 40.0%, UST group: 10.5%), also decreased was the number of patients who showed signs of a shock state (18.2%, 5.3%), who required an emergency operation (43.6%, 5.3%) and who underwent blood transfusion (49.1%, 5.3%). The average gestational period at the time when the patient underwent an operation was shortened by 4 days by using UST.

Eighteen patients had a serum level between 10 and 50 mIU/mL and the ICON was positive in 13. The five patients with a low serum beta-hCG level and a negative ICON had dilute urine when tested. Using a modified testing procedure, each of these produced a positive ICON. Of the 27 patients with an ectopic pregnancy the urine ICON was positive in 26.

A 25-year-old woman with 2 children was treated with injectable hormones for intermittent vaginal bleeding after insertion of an IUD. She was later seen in a health center where removal of the IUD was recommended because of a suspected strangulating endocervical polyp. Uncontrollable hemorrhage during the removal resulted in emergency admittance to the General Hospital of Acapulco and a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. The case met some of Rubin's criteria for a true cervical pregnancy established in 1911: the uterine cavity was empty, and the site of implantation of the blastocyst was below the internal orifice of the cervix and 1 cm above the external cervical opening. Schneider applied the term cervical pregnancy to all cases in which the pregnancy is \"obviously and predominantly\" situated in the cervix, whether the placenta extended to the isthmus or the endometrium. No pregnancy of greater than 12 weeks is available for histologic proof because of the growth of the placenta in areas contiguous to the cervix and the effacing effect of the growing ovisac. Numerous etiologic factors for cervical pregnancy have been proposed, of which the 3 finding greatest acceptance have been lack of an adequate endometrium for nidation of the trophoblast, a rapid passage of the egg through the uterine cavity, and a premature closing of the internal opening of the cervix. The frequency of cervical pregnancy has been estimated at 1 in 1000 to 1 in 16,000 pregnancies, but its true frequency is unknown. The case described is of great interest because it occurred with an IUD in place."

We found immunoenzymometric assays to be the most sensitive procedures (lowest detection limits) for qualitatively detecting hCG secreted by ectopic pregnancy. We concluded that the Tandem Icon best meets our criteria and we advocate its use in the emergency room or ward as the first-line investigation of ectopic pregnancy. In addition, the use of Diapreg-25 has many theoretical advantages as an extremely sensitive index of choriogonadotropin status because of its ability to detect very low concentrations of beta subunit."

The maternal mortality rate of 10.8 per 10 000 live births was considerably higher than the official rate of 4.8. The most common causes of death were hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (26%), haemorrhage (20%), ectopic pregnancy (10%), pulmonary embolus (8%), and sepsis (8%). Maternal mortality was closely related to both age and parity. The lowest rates were for women of para 2-4 aged 20-24 years and para 3-4 aged 25-29 years. The largest groups of avoidable factors were: non-use of and deficiencies in antenatal care; inadequacy in ensuring the delivery in hospital of women at high risk; and delays in taking action when signs of complications developed before, during, and after delivery. This article reports the results of a review of all maternal deaths occurring in Jamaica in 1981-83. A total of 192 maternal deaths were identified, yielding a maternal mortality rate of 10.8/10,000 live births, which was considerably higher than the official rate of 4.8. 15% of these deaths were associated with abortion or ectopic pregnancy. The most common causes of death were hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (26%), hemorrhage (20%), ectopic pregnancy (10%), pulmonary embolus (8%), and sepsis (8%). Maternal mortality was closely related to both age and parity. Lowest rates were noted among women of para 2-4 aged 20-24 years and para 3-4 aged 25-29 years. Avoidable factors were judged to be present in 68% of the deaths. The largest categories of avoidable factors were: nonuse of and deficiencies in antenatal care; inadequacy in ensuring the delivery in hospital of high-risk women; and delays in taking action when signs of complications developed before, during, and after delivery. In response to these findings, the Ministry of Health's Maternal Mortality Committee has called for the following actions: measures to encourage women to seek antenatal care early in pregnancy; improvements in antenatal monitoring; the referral of high-risk women for hospital delivery; the definition of standard procedures for dealing with specific complications of pregnancy, e.g., eclampsia and hemorrhage; regionalization of obstetric services and criteria for referring patients to hospital; and review of provision of blood and plasma for emergency transfusions."

    "abstract": "This discussion of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in less developed countries covers incidence/prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, sequelae, future trends, and new opportunities for STD control -- technological changes, health service changes, and social and political changes. For most countries, current, population-based information on STD is lacking, yet STDs appear to be common problems in nearly all countries. The prevalence of gonococcal infection in non-STD clinic populations has been as high as 5-20%, and incidence estimates made in a few settings have ranged from 3-10% per annum. These observations may overrepresent the STD problem, yet they have been identified in countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The prevalence of reactive serological tests for syphilis among antenatal clinic attendees has been as high as 10-15% in some countries of Africa and the Western Pacific. Chancroid infection is extremely common in many of the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Penicillinase-producing \"N. gonorrhoeae\" (PPNG) infections are a dramatic example of the emergence and worldwide dissemination of resistant gonococci since 1976. At this time PPNG isolates constitute over 10% of all gonococcal infections in nearly all southeast Asian and Africa settings where this problem has been explored. PPNG cause more than 50% of gonococcal infections in some settings. As a result of increasing PPNG prevalence, penicillin, previously the standard therapy for gonorrhea, has been replaced by alternative agents in many settings. A variety of antimicrobial agents are effective for PPNG infections, but these are too expensive or unavailable in many developing countries. Sequelae of STD produce enormous direct and indirect costs. Acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, and other STD agents is common throughout the world. In developing countries ectopic pregnancy is a common surgical emergency. Improved diagnostic tests, new approaches to treatment of STD, and development of vaccines provide opportunities for better STD control, as have changes in health care delivery. The promotion of the primary health care concept, a shift in emphasis of the international family planning programs, as well as a focus on support systems of health programs all are crucial to STD efforts, and their improvement enhances STD control possibilities. Also, greater discussion of the STD health problems has led to more serious consideration of these diseases and their control."

It is little known in the US, however. The 1st commercial version of a postcoital method recently became available to women in England. A former postcoital contraceptive was diethylstilbestrol (DES) which has been linked to cancer in the daughters of women who had taken the drug to prevent miscarriage. A new postcoital contraceptive regime was developed by Albert Yuzpe and consists of 4 ordinary contraceptive pills combining estrogen and progestin to be taken over a 12-hour period. In the US, this is the formulaion of birth control pill marketed under the trade name Ovral by Wyeth Laboratories. England and Germany are the only countries in which the Yuzpe method is officially approved for use as an emergency postocital contraceptive, but the method is used to some degree in most European countries, being well-known in France and Denmark. The most frequent side-effect reported by Yuzpe is vomiting experienced by 29% of women; another 22% felt nauseated. Other side effects, e.g. headache, were infrequent. The findings of the Pregnancy Advisory Service and the Brook Advisory Centre in Britain are reported. Overall very few side effects were found. Postcoital contraceptive treatment may cause the length of the cycle in which it occurs to be irregular. Treatment before day 15 has been found to shorten the cycle, whereas treatment after day 15 lengthens it. The majority of women who become pregnant due to treatment failure tend to seek an abortion. Ectopic pregnancy incidence may also be a result of treatment failure. In 1981, the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) issued a statement endorsing the use of postcoital contraceptives. Reasons for using them include rape, problems with barrier methods, ineffective use of the pill and IUD expulsion. No drug company in the US has expressed interest in getting FDA approval to market a postcoital contraceptive, partly because its usage might not be widespread. Opposition to approval from groups who believe life begins at conception and consequently that postcoital contraceptives are an abortifacient is expected."

All patients had a staging laparotomy with total splenectomy, liver biopsy, and sampling of abdominal lymph node groups. Four patients (1.7%) have had documented sepsis, and three have had possible sepsis. There has been no sepsis-related death. Intestinal obstruction requiring operation was noted in four patients (no intestinal resection required). Urgent operation was necessary in two patients, one with ureteral obstruction and one with ovarian torsion, following a repositioning procedure, neither of these patients died. Organisms in the four patients with positive blood cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae (two) and Haemophilus influenzae (two). Of the 234 patients in the study, 194 (83%) had received polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, and 174 (74%) were taking prophylactic antibiotics. One of the two patients with pneumococcal sepsis had not been vaccinated, and the second was vaccinated only during radiotherapy. Only one of the four patients with positive blood cultures was on a prophylactic antibiotic treatment regimen at the time of the septic episode. The liabilities in employing laparotomy-splenectomy for the evaluation of pediatric patients with Hodgkin's disease include both general surgical complications and an increase in the risk of hyperacute infection, specifically related to encapsulated species. The latter appears to be modified to a major degree by current prophylactic measures or therapy."

    "abstract": "A case of combined pregnancy, an unusual condition, is presented. A 17-year-old woman came to the emergency department because of left-sided, low abdominal pain. An intrauterine pregnancy and a right-sided ovarian cyst were demonstrated by ultrasound. The presence of the intrauterine pregnancy caused the clinicians to disregard symptoms and physical findings suggesting the concomitant presence of a ruptured left tubal ectopic pregnancy. Forty-eight hours later, when the patient was in impending shock, laparotomy revealed the ruptured left tubal ectopic pregnancy. Surgical treatment was successful. Six weeks later, a blighted ovum was removed from the uterus, confirming that two pregnancies had coexisted. Undue reliance on ultrasonography is criticized, and culdocentesis is advocated."

    "title": "Tubal conservation with ectopic gestations. A reappraisal.",
    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies have shown an increasing trend during the past decade. Factors that appear to be responsible are the intrauterine device (IUD), fallopian tube surgery (ligation reversals, reconstructive tuboplasty), and more effective antibiotics against pelvic inflammatory disease (precluding radical pelvic surgery). Our ability to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy at an earlier gestation (prior to rupture) through the use of highly sensitive pregnancy tests (Beta-HCG), ultrasonography, and diagnostic laparoscopy, has significantly altered our approach in treatment. Because these ectopic gestations are seen in a younger population, older nulliparous patients, and patients who desire future fertility, earlier diagnosis precludes an emergency approach to a now-elective procedure. In this paper, we will explore the pros and cons of conservative management for ectopic pregnancies, emphasizing present day evaluation and microsurgical approaches for repair. This article examines causal factors of ectopic pregnancy, discusses management with emphasis on tubal conservation, and updates information on diagnosis, fertility maximization, and minimization of risks of recurrent ectopic gestations. The common factor in ectopic gestations appears to be a delay in the transport of the fertilized ovum to the uterus, allowing the embryo to develop invasive trophoblast. Factors that appear to have increased the incidence of ectopic pregnancy over the past include increased sexual exposure, more effective theraphy for pelvic inflammatory disease, IUDs, tubal surgery, and surgical sterilization reversals. 77% of extrauterine gestations occur in the middle and distal thirds of the fallopian tube, with clinical manifestations largely determined by the site of implantation. Abdominal pain, amenorrhea/vaginal bleeding, and a pelvic mass are the classic signs of an ectopic pregnancy. Newer diagnostic procedures including serum human chorionic gonadotropin-beta subunit assay pregnancy testing supported by ultrasonography and laparoscopy have allowed the vast majority of tubal pregnancies to be diagnoses before rupture, permitting surgery to be undertaken more for the purpose of preserving fertility than for saving the mother's life. Factors in selecting candidates for conservative surgery include medical stability of the patient, parity, desire for future pregnancy, age under 35, mid or distal tubal gestation, prior ectopic gestation or tubal surgery. Considerations influencing the surgical approach for appropriate candidates include location of the pregnancy, condition of the involved and contralateral tube and ovary, pelvic anomalies, previous surgery, and need for ancillary procedures. If the ectopic gestation is located in the mid to distal segment of the fallopian tube, a segmental resection or salpingostomy using microsurgery should give a good anatomic and functional result. A review of the literature indicates that, contrary to prevailing opinion, recurrent etopic gestations are not more common in patients undergoing tubal conservation than in those undergoing more radical procedures. Recent data have shown term pregnancy rates of 40-55% and recurrent ectopic pregnancy rates of 5% in patients with conservative procedures, the improved rate being attributed to availability of microsurgical techniques, finer suture and minimal surgical trauma, which lead to less adhesions and scarring. tudies have indicated that use of Dextran minimizes pelvic adhesion formation, decreasing anatomic distortion leading to subsquent infertility or ectopic pregnancy."

    "abstract": "A retrospective analysis was made of 265 female outpatients who initially presented to an emergency department with a complaint of amenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, or abdominal/pelvic pain. The patients were discharged from the emergency department pending results of a serum pregnancy test. Forty-five of the patients were subsequently found to have an elevated (greater than 5 mIU/mL) beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level. Six of the patients had an ectopic pregnancy; their beta HCG levels ranged from 19 to 265 mIU/mL. A detectable beta HCG level less than 500 mIU/mL had a 33% probability of an ectopic pregnancy in the study group. Historical features, physical examination, and laboratory parameters were of limited value for identification of minimally symptomatic outpatients at risk for an ectopic pregnancy. No study patient had a systolic blood pressure of less than 86 mm Hg on presentation. A comparison group of 29 patients admitted to the hospital directly from the emergency department with a diagnosis of \"rule out ectopic pregnancy\" during the same time interval was identified. Nine of the directly admitted patients were found to have ectopic pregnancies. A statistically greater proportion of the directly admitted patients had a hematocrit less than 35% and a positive urine (tube) pregnancy test than that found for the study group. Five of the comparison group patients were noted to have a systolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 80 mm Hg. The beta HCG was found to be an essential tool in the evaluation of potential ectopic pregnancy in patients with minimal symptomatology."

    "title": "Postcoital contraception.",
    "abstract": "Postcoital contraceptives, the so-called \"morning after pill,\" are agents used as emergency treatment to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive accidents. In the 1960s and early 1970s high doses of estrogens were used in 5-day courses such as diethylstilbestrol 25-50 mg a day or ethinyl estradiol 0.5-5 mg a day begun within 72 hours after coitus. Although effective, a considerable drawback of the associated nausea and vomiting as well as an increased risk of menstrual disturbance during the treatment cycle. Norgestrel alone in various dosages has been used postcoitally. Quingestanol has been used as a continuing postcoital agent in Latin America but proved unacceptable owing to nausea and irregular bleeding. In China \"visiting pills\" have been devised containing anordrin. In the West regimens of this sort have been superseded by the Yuzpe treatment of 100 mcg ethinylestradiol and 0.5 mg levonorgestrel initially, repeated after precisely 12 hours. The treatment must be initiated within 72 hours of exposure. Postcoital contraceptives act by combinations of mechanisms--the function of the corpus luteum is disrupted, tubal motility may be affected, and changes in endometrial biochemistry prevent ovoimplantation. In a multicenter trial involving 602 women Yuzpe reported a pregnancy rate of 1.6%. Other workers show comparable figures of 0-3%. The primary side effects of the current hormonal method are nausea, which occurs in 61% of cases, and vomiting, 20% of cases. Both are mild and of short duration. All postcoital methods carry a risk of ectopic pregnancy should the treatment fail. 3 ectopic pregnancies were recorded with diethylstilbestrol and 1 recently with the Yuzpe regimen. There have been no reports of thromboembolic complications. If a hormonal form of postcoital treatment fails, the theoretical possibility of the pregnancy being harmed cannot be ruled out. The patient needs to be counseled about this, and careful records should be kept. Also important is the taking of an accurate menstrual and coital history to exclude exposures earlier in the menstrual cycle. Lippes and coworkers showed the efficacy of copper IUDs as postcoital agents. These can be used up to 5 days from intercourse. An IUD is preferred if hormones are contraindictated, if exposure was more than 72 hours beforehand, if the woman desires the most effective method, and if she wants the IUD for longterm contraception. Postcoital contraception, however defined, raises ethical questions. Postcoital methods could be classed as contraceptive rather than abortive within the maximum period (defined by medical scientific consensus) that may elapse between intercourse and nidation."

    "abstract": "Two groups of patients who were admitted to hospital with a possible diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy were compared. The levels of HCG in the plasma were obtained as an emergency in the first group (45 cases). The levels were not obtained in the second group (34 cases). Only those cases in the first group where the assays had shown the presence of HCG underwent laparoscopy: 12 laparoscopies revealed 7 extra-uterine pregnancies. In the second group, on the other hand, all 34 patients had laparoscopy; only 8 extra-uterine pregnancies were discovered by this method. Because of this study we found that when HCG assays were carried out there was no false positive or negative. When we wanted to rule out an L.H. peak in a doubtful case the assay was repeated. The comparison between the two groups underlines the importance of carrying out the assay: it avoids useless laparoscopies but it also shortens the length of stay in hospital."

    "abstract": "A case report of a rather uncommon and serious IUD complication, i.e., the occurrence of massive hemoperitoneum as a result of partial perforation of the uterus by a Lippes Loop IUD, is reported. A 33-year old woman, gravida 4, para 4, was admitted to an Israeli hospital in satisfactory general condition because of diffuse lower abdominal pain accompanied by vaginal staining. Past history revealed no severe previous illness. The woman's periods were regular with the last menstrual period occurring 25 days prior to admission. A Lippes Loop IUD had been inserted 1 year earlier but had caused no discomfort or side effects. On examination the lower abdomen was tender but no rebound tenderness was elicited. Pelvic examination revealed a markedly tender uterus and adnexa. No masses were palpated. Slight intraperitoneal bleeding was suspected, possibly because of ectopic pregnancy or bleeding corpus luteum. The IUD was removed by pulling on the strings which were visible. The procedure was relatively easy but caused marked pain to the patient. Several hours later she complained of diffuse abdominal pain and on palpation the entire abdomen was very tender and patulous. Her condition deteriorated rapidly; she was in shock. An emergency laparotomy was performed. On opening the peritoneal cavity, a large amount of 2000 ml fresh blood and blood clots was observed. The adnexa were found to be normal. On further exploration, a tear of approximately 15 mm was located in the anterior wall of the uterus below the fundus, with active bleeding from a tiny blood vessel. The tear was repaired. The postoperative course was uneventful. The case described seems to represent an instance of embedding of an IUD. Whether complete perforation occurred during intercourse or upon removal is unclear. It is assumed that the IUD in this case was a type 1-2 perforation, i.e., part in the uterine cavity and part in the myometrium, with a degree of variation of the major portion being in the uterine cavity and only a small part in myometrium since insertion or some time following it, with a different degree of the variety, or the IUD only slightly in the uterine cavity with a large degree of myometrial perforation after removal. It is suggested that if a problem is encountered during IUD removal and transmigration of an IUD is suspected, no attempts should be made to remove it per vagina even if the strings are palpable. Under these circumstances, the type and degree of perforation should be diagnosed and its removal by laparotomy or laparoscopy must be considered."

    "abstract": "A study of 100 consecutive cases of ectopic pregnancy managed over a 21-month period in the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology is reported. The results show that this is a common gynaecological emergency in the community. Although pelvic inflammatory disease appears to be an important aetiological factor, a significant proportion showed no evidence of previous pelvic sepsis. The usual surgical treatment of cases in our unit is, where possible, total salpingectomy rather than salpingo-oophorectomy. A detailed prospective study of cases of ectopic pregnancy in Benin City was undertaken at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) establish the incidence and clinical pattern of presentation and to appraise the method of surgical management used. This study included the 1st 100 cases of ectopic pregnancy admitted between April 1978 and December 1979. The following details were analyzed in all cases: biological and social data such as age, reproductive status, and marital status; clinical presentation on admission; findings at laparotomy and type of surgical treatment; and morbidity and mortality. During the period under study, there were 4318 deliveries in the maternity unit (live births and stillbirths), giving an incidence of 1 ectopic pregnancy for every 43 births (2.31%). The corresponding figure obtained for the unit in an earlier study for the 1973-76 period was 1 in 58. 92 of the patients were married, 5 divorced, and 3 single. The series cut across the social strata of the Nigerian community, although most of the women were full time housewives who participated in petty trading to supplement the husband's income. 10% were pregnant for the 1st time, whereas 81% had had 1 or more previous deliveries, including abortion in some cases. Only 3% of the patients had had a previous ectopic pregnancy. The frequency of a positive past history of induced abortion among the cases of ectopic pregnancy was 22%. Among the patients of similar reproductive status who were admitted into the gynecological ward during the same period for other conditions, and who had never had ectopic pregnancy, the corresponding figure was 8.4%. Pain, often very severe, was the most prominent symptom presented by all 92 patients who were fit to give a history on admission. Vaginal bleeding of various types was present in 51% of cases. Symptoms of gastrointestinal disturbance occurred in 33%. The most reliable and common findings on physical examination were abdominal tenderness with or without \"rebound tenderness\" and \"cervical excitation pain.\" Both signs were present in 92% of the patients. 63% of the patients showed gross evidence of previous pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) at laparotomy. Salpingectomy was the treatment of choice in 90% of the cases. Results of treatment appear satisfactory as there was no maternal death."

    "abstract": "Over the five years 1975-79 at Yale-New Haven Hospital, ectopic pregnancy changed from a disease requiring acute emergency are utilizing radical surgery for a ruptured ectopic to a disease requiring chronic, observant care utilizing conservative treatment for the unruptured ectopic. One hundred ninety-five cases of ectopic pregnancy have been retrospectively reviewed to determine how laparoscopy, ultrasound and beta pregnancy testing have affected this change. Over the reviewed period of time, the rate of diagnosed and treated unruptured ectopic pregnancies increased from 8% to 35%. Those patients with ectopic pregnancies having laparoscopy prior to laparotomy rose from 11% to 29.5%. Ultrasound diagnosed intrauterine pregnancy in 13% of those patients suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy by defining an intrauterine gestational sac and demonstrated a mass in 85% of patients diagnosed as having an ectopic pregnancy, although the mass was not always the ectopic pregnancy. Beta pregnancy testing, available only over the past two years, was positive in 99%, with only one false negative. One hundred twenty-eight culdocenteses were done, with 85% positive, and was the most important factor in deciding on emergency versus expectant care. These factors have allowed us to treat ectopic pregnancy expectantly, making the diagnosis sooner and more accurately, leading to an increase in conservative treatment and employing salpingostomy as opposed to salpingectomy as the rate of unruptured ectopic pregnancy increases."

    "abstract": "The increasing importance of an ectopic pregnancy as a cause of maternal death presents a challenge that will be met when primary care physicians combine a high index of suspicion with the ability to recognize the patient most at risk. The major symptoms, abdominal pain, secondary amenorrhea and abnormal vaginal bleeding are well known, as are the major signs, abdominal tenderness, adnexal mass and tenderness on motion of the cervix. Less well known are factors in the clinical history which indicate the patient to be at high risk. These include primary or secondary infertility, previous abortion or ectopic pregnancy and previous tubal operation, either reconstructive or sterilizing. In addition, the use of an intrauterine contraceptive device or its recent removal because of abdominal pain or bleeding, or both, is highly significant. Of major importance is a history of recent uterine evacuation. Should the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy be under consideration, procrastination by observation is no longer acceptable. An active effort must be made to confirm or deny the diagnosis, Culdocentesis should be performed in the emergency department or clinic. If positive, prompt laparotomy is indicated. Should the result of culdocentesis be unsatisfactory or negative, laparotomy should be undertaken with further delay. Ectopic pregnancy is a serious complication of pregnancy accounting for 6-13% of all maternal deaths in the U.S. Early diagnosis and treatment is absolutely necessary to ensure a successful outcome. In the period from January 1, 1965-December 31, 1979, 556 consecutive cases of ectopic pregnancy were treated at The Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, accounting for less than 1% of all pregnancies handled in that period. 3 of these cases had an ovarian pregnancy, 8 had an abdominal, and 545 a tubal pregnancy. Relevant personal characteristics and aspects of obstetric history of these cases were studied. 85% of them had used no contraception prior to the ectopic pregnancy. Maternal age was not a factor in the occurrence of the ectopic pregnancy. The following factors in the clinical history were found to put the patient in a high-risk category: 1) primary or secondary infertility; 2) previous abortion or ectopic pregnancy; 3) previous tubal operation, either reconstructive or sterilizing; 4) recent uterine evacuation; and 5) the use of an IUD or its recent removal due to abdominal pain and/or bleeding. Major symptoms were found to be abdominal pain, common symptoms or early pregnancy, abdominal tenderness, adnexal mass, and tenderness on motion of the cervix. Culdocentesis and laparoscopy are effective diagnostic aids. Procrastination by observation should not be followed."

In 3 cases the gestation sac was tubal, with 2 in the ampullary portion and 1 in the isthmic portion. The 4th case was a left tubo-ovarian mass, showing an embryo within an ovarian gestation sac. Microscopic examination of the tube revealed chorionic villi intermingled with areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The diagnosis of the ovarian pregnancy was based on the demonstration of chorionic villi in relation to the ovarian medullary portion, showing a loose connective tissue structure and prominent congested blood vessels. Case 1, a 27-year old, para 2+0, presented with pain, amenorrhea, bleeding, and fever. The clinical diagnosis was septic abortion with IUD in situ. The loop was removed and curettage was scanty. Antibiotics were administered. The fever subsided but the abdominal pain persisted and mass in the right adnexa could be felt. Laparoscopy was performed, confirming the diagnosis of right tubal pregnancy. Laparotomy and right salpingectomy were performed. The 2nd case, para 1+0, had an IUD for 1 year and was admitted as an emergency. The diagnosis was acute abdomen, mostly disturbed ectopic pregnancy. Laparotomy was performed, and ectopic pregnancy in the region of the isthmus of the right tube was diagnosed. Right salpingectomy was performed. Both cases 3 and 4 had IUDs for a period of between 1-2 years and had amenorrhea, bleeding, and tenesmus. They were treated as colitis. The amenorrhea ranged between 2-3 months. Examination revealed a mass on the left side. Laparotomy was performed. In case 3 it was ampullary pregnancy on the left side. In case 4 there was a tubo-ovarian mass with an amniotic sac protruding from this mass. Left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. All patients had uneventful recoveries. Figures illustrate these tubal and ovarian pregnancies."

From January 1968 through December 1975, 313 patients with ectopic pregnancy were treated at Chicago Lying-In Hospital. The historical and physical findings, diagnostic procedures, causative factors and patient management are reviewed and discussed. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain and amenorrhea. More than half the patients were misdiagnosed prior to admission. Only 30% had distinct adnexal masses. The treatment of choice was salpingectomy unless the opposite tube was absent or damaged. Three deaths occurred in this series. Only 31% of the patients gave histopathologic evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease. 313 patients with ectopic pregnancy were treated at Chicago Lying-In Hospital in 1968-1975, for a frequency of 1 in 72 deliveries. Historical and physical findings, diagnostic procedures, causative factors, and patient management were reviewed for 284 of these patients. 97.5% of the pregnancies were tubal. 25% of the patients were nulliparas and 31.7% were primiparas. 34.9% had had 1 or more previous abortions. The mean age of the patients was 28. Most had been using no contraception, and only 3.9% had an IUD in situ. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (96.7%) and amenorrhea (73.6%), while the most frequent abdominal findings were tenderness (83.4%), rebound pain (41.2%), and guarding (28.9%). Adnexal tenderness was found in 72.2% and 30% had distinct adnexal masses. An initial misdiagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease was made in 132 (46.5%) cases. A culdocentesis and slide latex agglutination inhibition pregnancy test performed in 167 and 102 patients, respectively, gave 82.6 and 73.5% positive rates. Diagnostic laparoscopy was used routinely after 1970 on all nonacute patients in whom ectopic pregnancy was suspected, and this led to a significant drop in the rate of ruptured pregnancies (63% pre-1970 and 45% post-1970). 25% of patients were sterilized, but the treatment of choice was salpingectomy unless the opposite tube was absent or damaged. Gross evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease was noted in 36% of patients and 31% had salpingitis. The most common postoperative complication was fever (42.2%). 3 deaths occurred in the series (2 due to acute pulmonary edema resulting from fluid overload), for a maternal death rate from ectopic gestation of 13.83/100,000 live births.

The technique used in this series of six unruptured ectopic pregnancies of the ampulla consisted in a subserous enucleation-excision of the ectopic ovum with end-to-end anastomosis on a polyethylene wire, followed by early hydrotubations. Hysterosalpingographic controls performed 3 months after the operation showed in all six cases bilateral passage and peritoneal spill of the contrast medium. Three patients have at the time of writing intrauterine pregnancy (16, 22 and 33 weeks old). Thus the anatomical integrity of the fallopian tubes could be restored in every case, as early as the emergency laparotomy for suspicion of unruptured ectopic pregnancy confirmed by laparoscopy. No early or late postoperative complications occurred in this series."

    "abstract": "It is discussed how the adult type contraception fits the divergent needs of the youngsters. Oral contraceptives are suitable from the 16th year of life. Vaginal globuli and foams have also proved to be an effective means of contraception over that period of life. For anatomical reasons pessaries are not recommended, insertion of intrauterine devices is contraindicated because of their possible adverse effects. Experiences with university students taking d-Norgestrel as \"morning-after-pill\" have been favorable. The therapeutic abortion is regarded as an emergency measure to be employed only if anticonception failed. Adaequate education at the proper age and the importance of preventive measures are stressed. Methods of contraception for teenagers are discussed. Oral contraceptives are acceptable over 16 years of age; before then they may have undesirable effects on hormonal balance and growth. IUDs are associated with increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy and endometritis, which may lead to sterility; they are therefore not recommended for persons who may later desire children. Condoms and vaginal spermicidal suppositories may be highly acceptable. The diaphragm is unreliable in teenagers because of their anatomical proportions. Rhythm (Knaus-Ogino) is theoretically useful, but since it is usually a matter of accidental sexual opportunities, this method is not really practical. Abortion has many immediate and late complications, but should be available as a last line of defense. This may be performed using classic dilation and curettage or vacuum aspiration before the 12th week, and instillation of rivanol, saline, or prostaglandin solutions thereafter."

The greatest clinical experience exists with the Lippes loop. The loop should be the method of choice for parous women, the Copper-T for the nullipara and nulligravida. Regularly menstruating women should be advised to use additional contraceptive protection (condom, diaphragm, coitus interruptus, foam) during the week of highest fertility.

Since there is a clinically safe and economical AT-apparatus available the routine application of this rational blood replacement method is easy to perform. The authors have used this technique altogether in 111 patients, applying the Bentley-ATS-machine in the last 69 cases. In a previous series of 42 cases AT was used for ruptured ectopic pregnancy, in the series of 69 surgical cases for hemothorax or intraabdominal hemorrhages of mainly traumatic origin. The most frequent indications for AT in emergency surgical operations were ruptures of spleen and liver, and in elective surgery for portocaval shunt. Altogether 247 litres of blood have been retransfused with an AT-volume per patient ranging from 0,5 to 15 litres. For anticoagulation generally ACD was used, only in vascular surgery was heparin preferred. Methodical complications have not been seen. Technique, indications, consequences and possible complications of AT are described. The main advantages of autologous intraoperative transfusion are the immediate availability of blood, the absence of the risk of hepatitis and of incompatibility reactions, reduction of pressure on the blood banks and lower transfusion costs. The authors therefore believe that the possibility of intraoperative AT should exist at every surgical and gynecological clinic."

    "abstract": "Ruptured ectopic pregnancy constitutes a major gynecologic emergency which may result in death. From 1965 through 1973, 122 patients with ectopic pregnancy were treated at Wilford Hall USAF Hospital. Diagnostic procedures, causative factors, and patient management are reviewed and discussed. The most common symptoms were pain (95%), amenorrhea (79%), and abnormal bleeding (76%). An adnexal mass was found in only 40% of the patients. The treatment of choice was salpingectomy, and there were no deaths in this group of patients."

    "abstract": "Utilizing a disposable unit, intraoperative autotranfusion was employed during surgery in 53 patients admitted to the Bexar County Teaching Hospital at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. During the two-year period of study, 26 patients underwent surgery for major traumatic injuries, 8 for ruptured ectopic pregnancy and 19 for miscellaneous emergency or elective conditions. The indication for intraoperative autotransfusion was an anticipated blood loss of 1,000 ml or more. Contraindications for its use were colon injury or localized infection. Over 325 units of blood were salvaged and returned directly to these patients during surgery. One death related to the use of the autotransfusor unit was due to massive air embolism. Twenty other deaths were associated with severe injuries and irreversible shock requiring greater than 3,600 ml of both autologous and homologous blood. Eight of these patients demonstrated severe pancoagulopathies. In the remaining patients, clotting factors and plasma or urine hemoglobin levels were transiently abnormal. However, there were no clinically apparent bleeding defects or renal problems detected. Postoperative blood cultures were consistently negative. It is concluded that intraoperative autotransfusion, when properly employed, is a safe, practical and technically feasible procedure."

    "abstract": "To ascertain the causes of high maternal mortality in West Bengal, the author examined maternal mortality between 1964-68. It was intended that measures to improve the situation in rural areas could be suggested. Women in labor often arrive at the hospital very late and few antenatal care facilities are available in rural areas. High risk cases often are delivered at home, a situation which often results in fetal complications. Maternal deaths have declined, but not dramatically. Of the 24,265 deliveries at the Burdwan district hospital, there were 333 maternal deaths for an incidence of 13.7/1000, along with another 42 cases where death was due to pregnancy-associated causes. In contrast, the maternal mortality rate in a district hospital in Calcutta was 4/1000 in 1968. Eclampsia accounted for 42.34% (141) of maternal deaths making it the major cause of death. In Calcutta this cause of death is receding gradually but in the districts it still accounts for a heavy loss of life (an incidence of 1 in 38). Adequate antenatal care would reduce this high mortality. 2 factors which have contributed to the high mortality are the hours lost in transporting a patient from a rural area and inadequate hospital staff. Postpartum hemorrhage and/or retained placenta was responsible for 39 deaths and none of the cases admitted from outside had received antenatal care. A shortage of blood was also a contributory factor. Severe anemia was responsible for 34 deaths and abortions resulted in another 29 deaths (16 because of severe sepsis; 13 due to hemorrhage or shock). An emergency service would help reduce the number of deaths but at present such a service does not even exist in the urban areas. Ruptured uterus resulted in 29 deaths and obstructed labor in 27 deaths. Placenta previa brought about 14 deaths and the remaining 20 deaths were due to such causes as accidental hemorrhage (10), hydatidiform mole (4), puerperal sepsis (3), ectopic pregnancy (2), and uterine inversion (1). Timely admission would have helped most of these cases. In summation, the preventive measures which would help to lower maternal mortality are: 1) mass education about the need for antenatal care, 2) provision of good obstetrical service, 3) provision of quick transport, 4) adequate staffing of hospitals, 5) refresher courses for medical personnel, and 6) 24 hour blood transfusion service."

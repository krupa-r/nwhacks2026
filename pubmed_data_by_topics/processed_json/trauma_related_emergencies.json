    "title": "Recurrent ovarian torsion challenges in management and saving fertility: A rare case report.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive gynecologic emergency that may lead to irreversible ovarian damage. The condition becomes particularly critical in women with a solitary ovary, where timely diagnosis is essential to preserve fertility. A woman of reproductive age with a history of right oophorectomy due to torsion of a mature cystic teratoma presented to the emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Pelvic ultrasound revealed the absence of the right ovary and a complex left ovarian cyst measuring 6 × 6 cm, with signs of congestion. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a twisted, violaceous left ovary measuring approximately 10 × 10 cm with two full twists of the infundibulopelvic (IP) and utero-ovarian (OU) ligaments. Detorsion was performed. Current evidence challenges traditional practices of routine oophorectomy in torsion, as histologic studies report preserved viability in 43 % of ovaries despite ischemic appearance. This case reinforces the feasibility of detorsion in reproductive-aged women, particularly those with a solitary ovary, to safeguard fertility. The absence of contralateral ovarian tissue further underscores the need for conservative surgical approaches. This report emphasizes the critical role of early recognition and conservative surgical management in ovarian torsion, especially in patients with a solitary ovary. Timely detorsion can prevent irreversible fertility loss, even in grossly ischemic-appearing ovaries. Patient education about acute pelvic pain and clinician vigilance in high-risk populations are essential to mitigate diagnostic delays."

    "title": "A case report of jejunal myeloid sarcoma presented with intestinal intussusception in a 19-year-old man: An uncommon presentation of a rare disease.",
    "abstract": "Intussusception is a rare condition in adults, with an adult-to-pediatric incidence ratio of approximately 1:20. Unlike pediatric cases, adult intussusception is almost always secondary to an underlying pathological lesion. Myeloid sarcoma is an uncommon extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia and represents a rare cause of gastrointestinal involvement. We report the case of a 19-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain and signs of intestinal obstruction. Abdominal computed tomography revealed jejunal intussusception. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, during which a necrotic lesion was identified on the jejunal wall, along with three additional lesions on the intestinal wall. A frozen section biopsy suggested differential diagnoses, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and intestinal lymphoma. The lesion causing the intussusception was resected with clear margins, while the remaining lesions were left in situ based on intraoperative pathology. Postoperative histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of jejunal myeloid sarcoma. The patient was subsequently re-admitted for resection and re-anastomosis of the remaining lesions and was referred to the oncology department. Adult intussusception is often misdiagnosed due to its rarity and nonspecific presentation. In most cases, it is caused by an underlying lesion, which necessitates thorough intraoperative evaluation and appropriate surgical management. Myeloid sarcoma involving the gastrointestinal tract is exceptionally rare and may mimic other neoplastic conditions. This case highlights the importance of considering rare hematologic malignancies such as myeloid sarcoma in young adults presenting with intussusception."

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is traditionally considered a disease of older adults; however, the incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer (YOCRC) is steadily increasing worldwide. This trend presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings where awareness and screening programs are often lacking. We report the case of a 26-year-old male with a three-year history of vague abdominal symptoms, including intermittent pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Despite multiple healthcare visits, the underlying pathology remained undiagnosed until he presented with acute intestinal obstruction. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed an advanced colonic mass. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the colon, staged as pT3N2Mx. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of YOCRC, which often presents with nonspecific symptoms and is underestimated in younger populations. In low-resource environments, limited access to diagnostic modalities and low clinical suspicion contribute to frequent misdiagnoses and delayed detection, resulting in presentation at advanced stages and reduced chances for curative treatment. This report emphasizes the need for heightened clinical suspicion of colorectal cancer in younger patients presenting with persistent gastrointestinal complaints, highlights the importance of timely access to diagnostic tools to reduce delays in care, and underscores the public health value of awareness campaigns and consideration of earlier screening to address the rising burden of YOCRC."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a catastrophic hemodynamic emergency. While ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement is a common neurosurgical procedure, its typical complications include obstruction and infection. No prior cases of intraoperative cardiac tamponade during VP shunt placement have been reported. We present a case of life-threatening cardiac tamponade that occurred during VP shunt insertion in a patient with severe cerebral edema. The patient developed abrupt hemodynamic collapse, progressing to pulseless electrical activity requiring emergency cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Prompt diagnosis was achieved by point-of-care ultrasonography, and immediate pericardiocentesis was life-saving. This case illustrates a previously unreported, lethal complication of VP shunt surgery, potentially resulting from unintended cardiac penetration by the ventricular catheter. We alert anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons to consider this etiology in cases of unexplained intraoperative collapse and advocate for the ready availability of ultrasound for rapid diagnosis."

    "title": "Screening Pediatric Trauma Patients for Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury Using the McGovern Score: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI), defined as an injury occurring to the carotid and/or vertebral arteries, occurs in ~1% of pediatric blunt trauma patients and is associated with morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the McGovern score, a pediatric-specific screening tool for BCVI, and describe the effect of its implementation on the use of additional imaging for BCVI and the detection of BCVI. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients below 16 years old presenting with blunt trauma to the Pediatric Emergency Department of a tertiary care level 1 pediatric trauma center pre- (July 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021) and post- (December 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022) implementation of McGovern scoring into the clinical decision algorithm for blunt trauma. Patient characteristics, diagnostic studies used [including computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the neck vessels], and outcomes (BCVI, stroke, mortality), were obtained from the medical record and compared pre-McGovern versus post-McGovern score implementation. A total of 1189 patients were included in the study; 664 preimplementation of the McGovern scoring and 525 postimplementation. Median age was 6 years (IQR 2 to 11), and 668 (56%) were trauma activations (leveled traumas), with no significant differences in patient characteristics between the 2 cohorts. Imaging for BCVI was performed in 13 (2.0%) patients in the preimplementation group and 27 (5.0%) patients in the postimplementation group (P=0.003). BCVI was detected in 12/1189 patients overall (1.0%); 2 in the preimplementation group (0.3%), and 10 (1.9%) in the postimplementation group (P=0.007). In the postimplementation group, the sensitivity of the McGovern score was 90% while the specificity was 96.7%. The implementation of the McGovern score into the pediatric trauma decision algorithm was associated with the detection of an increased number of BCVIs compared to the preimplementation group, with good sensitivity and specificity, but a significant increase in the use of imaging."

    "abstract": "Cardiac myeloid sarcoma is a rare hematologic malignancy characterized by myeloid blasts invading cardiac tissue. A 68-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome status post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant presented with worsening dyspnea. He was hypoxic but remained hemodynamically stable. Computed tomography angiography chest revealed a large pericardial effusion, and transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed tamponade physiology. The patient underwent an emergent pericardial window, followed by further work-up, including computed tomography, transthoracic echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance, and intracardiac biopsy with novel use of the TLAB device, which identified a right atrial mass consistent with cardiac myeloid sarcoma extending along the interventricular groove with superior vena cava stenosis. Cardiac myeloid sarcoma is a rare primary cardiac malignancy with no established treatment guidelines, but multimodal imaging and accurate tissue diagnosis can help tailor therapy. This case report illustrates a rare case of cardiac myeloid sarcoma and demonstrates feasibility of intracardiac biopsy with novel use of a TLAB device."

    "abstract": "We report the case of a 36-year-old woman, at 28 weeks of twin pregnancy, with no history of gestational hypertensive disorders, admitted to the emergency department with intermittent chest and epigastric pain while hemodynamically stable. Upper abdominal ultrasound revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity and hemangiomas in the right hepatic lobe. The patient subsequently developed a drop in hematimetric levels and underwent an emergency cesarean section, which confirmed intrauterine fetal demise of one twin and delivery of the surviving neonate. During subsequent exploratory laparotomy, rupture of the right hepatic lobe with a large capsular hematoma was detected, followed by hepatic packing, abdominal drainage, and reoperation after 48 hours, which achieved hemostatic control. Both the patient and the newborn were discharged after 40 days of hospitalization and were in good general condition after 4 months of follow-up. Due to its wide variability in clinical presentation, spontaneous hepatic rupture during pregnancy is often underdiagnosed, compromising clinical management and negatively impacting maternal-fetal survival. Early diagnosis and individualized management strategies, combined with an interdisciplinary approach, are crucial for optimal maternal and fetal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Traumatic pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring timely diagnosis and management, particularly in the prehospital setting where diagnostic tools are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of clinical signs used by emergency physicians in the field to identify traumatic pneumothorax requiring early thoracic decompression. We conducted a retrospective observational study in a French level I trauma center from January 2015 to August 2022. All patients with CT-confirmed pneumothorax managed by prehospital emergency physicians were included. The primary endpoint was the diagnostic performance of prehospital clinical assessment to identify pneumothorax requiring early decompression (prehospital or within four hours of admission). Statistical analysis was focused on predictive performance of three clinical signs (asymmetric lung auscultation, thoracic expansion asymmetry, and subcutaneous emphysema) in identifying cases requiring early decompression, using univariable analyses and the construction of a composite predictive score by logistic regression. Among 280 included patients, 115 (41%) required early thoracic decompression. Clinical suspicion of pneumothorax was present in 63% (95% CI: 54‒71) of these cases. Asymmetric lung auscultation showed the highest sensitivity (74%; 95% CI: 62‒86), while subcutaneous emphysema demonstrated the highest specificity (79%; 95% CI: 68‒89). The overall clinical suspicion rate across the cohort was 46% (95% CI: 41‒52). A composite predictive score using the three clinical signs demonstrated better diagnostic performance (AUC 0.63 (95% CI 0.57‒0.69); score = 1 OR 2.0 [95% CI 1.1‒3.6], score = 2 OR 3.0 [95% CI 1.6‒5.7]; score = 3 OR 11.0 [95% CI 1.3‒96.8]). Prehospital clinical assessment alone had limited diagnostic performance for detecting blunt traumatic pneumothorax requiring early decompression. A simple clinical composite score offers higher specificity but remains insufficiently sensitive to be used as a standalone diagnostic tool; it may support field decision-making as a risk-stratification aid, but prehospital clinical signs alone are not sufficient to rule out a pneumothorax requiring early decompression."

    "abstract": "In this study, we sought to characterize the epidemiologic features of trauma in Eeyou Istchee and describe outcomes for patients referred to our institution. Our primary objectives were to better define the regional burden of injury, identify potentially hidden trauma mortality, and explore opportunities for injury prevention and trauma system optimization in this unique setting in northern Quebec. We conducted a retrospective review of our institutional trauma registry, identifying all trauma patients transferred to the Montreal General Hospital from Eeyou Istchee between 2012 and 2022. We extracted and analyzed patient demographics, mechanisms of injury, and outcomes. We also reviewed the coroner's reports for all trauma-related deaths in Eeyou Istchee over the same period. We used descriptive statistics for analysis. A total of 587 patients (aged 18 to 91 yr) were transferred, including 353 males (60.1%) and 234 females (39.9%). The highest number of transfers (n = 84, 14.3%) occurred in 2022. The most common mechanisms of injury were blunt trauma (n = 228, 38.8%) and falls (n = 163, 27.8%). We also observed motor vehicle collisions (n = 103, 17.5%) and penetrating trauma (n = 50, 8.5%), while 17 cases (2.9%) involved other mechanisms, and 26 (4.4%) were of unknown origin. Assault was reported by 211 (35.9%) patients. Of all patients, 146 (24.9%) were admitted, and 441 (75.1%) were discharged from the emergency department. Computed tomography was performed for 376 patients (85.3%), among whom 222 (59.0%) patients had no injuries identified. Coroner data identified 82 trauma-related deaths, including 61 males (74.4%) and 21 females (25.6%). Motor vehicle collisions were the most common cause of death (n = 23, 28.0%). The trauma-related mortality rate in Eeyou Istchee was 47.8 per 10 000 population, compared with 27.8 per 10 000 in the rest of Quebec, yielding a relative risk of 1.72. There is a marked disparity in trauma-related mortality between Eeyou Istchee and the rest of Quebec, with motor vehicle collisions representing the leading cause of trauma death. Strengthening partnerships with local communities in Eeyou Istchee is essential to enhance awareness, promote injury prevention, and improve trauma system effectiveness in the region."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous colonic perforation is a rare but life-threatening surgical emergency, particularly uncommon in children without predisposing conditions. We report a 4-year-old male who presented with acute febrile illness, suprapubic abdominal pain, and dysuria, initially managed as cystitis. Despite treatment, he developed peritonitis; imaging revealed free subdiaphragmatic air. Exploratory laparotomy showed an ischemic ascending colon with a solitary perforation, necessitating right hemicolectomy with ileocolic anastomosis. Histopathology demonstrated nonspecific ileitis, typhlitis, and colitis complicated by cecal perforation, with no evidence of typhoid, tuberculosis, or inflammatory bowel disease. Postoperative recovery was uneventful following broad-spectrum antibiotics. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of spontaneous colonic perforation in children, where non-specific presentations may mimic urinary tract or infectious illnesses. Early recognition and timely surgical intervention are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. To our knowledge, this represents one of the few pediatric reports of spontaneous ascending colon perforation in the absence of identifiable etiology."

    "title": "[Detection and emergency management of visceral injuries after abdominal trauma : Hollow organ and mesenteric injuries-keep in mind].",
    "abstract": "Hollow organ and mesenteric injuries occur in up to 7% of all cases of abdominal trauma and are linked to high morbidity and mortality, especially with delayed diagnosis and treatment. The causes include blunt, penetrating or blast injuries. Hollow organ injuries are more frequent in penetrating trauma, while injuries of the parenchymatous organs dominate in blunt trauma. The clinical diagnosis is difficult as the early symptoms are often nonspecific. Important predictors include abdominal tenderness, the seatbelt sign, leukocytosis, lactatemia and abnormalities in computed tomography (CT). The use of CT is considered the gold standard in the diagnostics but has limited sensitivity despite high specificity. Therefore, close clinical monitoring and, if necessary, repeated imaging is mandatory. Scoring systems, such as the bowel injury prediction score (BIPS) help identify injuries which require surgery. The treatment depends on the injury pattern and the condition of the patient. Stable patients without radiological signs of injury can initially be managed conservatively. Specific CT signs (e.g., pneumoperitoneum, bowel wall discontinuity) indicate the need for surgical exploration. Surgical options range from simple suturing to resection with primary anastomosis or placement of a stoma. In unstable patients damage control strategies including open abdomen therapy may be required. Hohlorgan- und mesenteriale Verletzungen treten bei bis zu 7 % aller Abdominaltraumata auf und gehen, insbesondere bei verzögerter Diagnosestellung und Therapie, mit hoher Morbidität und Mortalität einher. Ursachen sind stumpfe, penetrierende oder Explosionsverletzungen. Insbesondere beim penetrierenden Trauma dominieren die Hohlorganverletzungen, während beim stumpfem Trauma Verletzungen der parenchymatösen Organe überwiegen. Die klinische Diagnose ist schwierig, da Frühsymptome oft unspezifisch sind. Wichtige Prädiktoren sind der abdominelle Druckschmerz, Gurtmarken, Leukozytose, Laktatämie sowie Auffälligkeiten in der Computertomographie (CT). Die CT gilt als Goldstandard der Diagnostik, weist jedoch trotz hoher Spezifität nur begrenzte Sensitivität auf. Eine engmaschige klinische Überwachung und ggf. wiederholte bildgebende Untersuchungen sind erforderlich. Scoring-Systeme wie der Bowel Injury Prediction Score (BIPS) erleichtern die Identifikation operationspflichtiger Verletzungen. Die Therapie richtet sich nach dem Verletzungsmuster und dem Zustand des Patienten. Stabile Patienten ohne Verletzungsnachweis können zunächst konservativ versorgt werden (Überwachung). Spezifische CT-Zeichen (z. B. Pneumoperitoneum, Darmwanddiskontinuität) indizieren die operative Exploration. Operative Maßnahmen reichen von der Übernähung über die Resektion mit primärer Anastomose bis hin zur Anlage eines Stomas. Beim instabilen Patienten können Damage-Control-Strategien, einschließlich der offenen Abdomentherapie, notwendig sein."

    "abstract": "Severely injured children account for only a small proportion of emergency medical service (EMS) missions but pose major challenges to the emergency teams due to age-related anatomy and physiology, complex injury patterns and high emotional stress. This narrative review summarizes the current evidence on the epidemiology and prehospital management of pediatric trauma patients in the German EMS system and places these findings in an international context. A PubMed search was carried out using the terms \"children\", \"trauma\" and \"prehospital\". Studies reporting the prehospital management of injured children and adolescents were included. Out of 421 records 20 studies were selected and complemented by backward citation searches, with a focus on data from Germany and comparable high-income countries. Pediatric emergencies account for approximately 5% of ground EMS (GEMS) and 6-13% of helicopter EMS (HEMS) missions; severely injured children (e.g. NACA IV-VII) constitute only a small fraction, making pediatric polytrauma a classical low-frequency, high-impact scenario. The proportion of traumatic emergencies increases with age and peaks during adolescence; boys are overrepresented in all cohorts. Falls and traffic incidents dominate, predominantly resulting in blunt trauma with injuries mainly to the head and extremities. Polytrauma is reported in only around 5% of injured children and primarily affects older children and adolescents. Oxygen administration, intravenous access, immobilization and analgesia are frequent measures, whereas intubation, intraosseous access, chest drainage and other invasive procedures are rare. Several studies indicate an association between HEMS or direct admission to a (pediatric) major trauma center and improved survival. Pediatric trauma patients represent a small but high-risk group in whom invasive procedures must be performed under time pressure and emotional stress. The management of complex cases by specialized HEMS teams and clearly designated (pediatric) major trauma centers, the strengthening of paramedic-based care, simulation-based training, standardized prehospital and in-hospital outcome-oriented data collection and the further expansion of regionally coordinated trauma networks are key steps towards improving prehospital care for injured children. HINTERGRUND: Schwer verletzte Kinder machen nur einen kleinen Anteil der Einsätze im Rettungsdienst aus, stellen die Einsatzteams aber aufgrund altersabhängiger Anatomie und Physiologie, komplexer Verletzungsmuster und hoher emotionaler Belastung vor große Herausforderungen. Diese narrative Übersichtsarbeit fasst die Evidenz zu Epidemiologie und präklinischer Versorgung pädiatrischer Traumapatienten im deutschen Rettungsdienst zusammen und ordnet die Befunde in einen internationalen Kontext ein. Es wurde eine PubMed-Suche mit den Begriffen „children“, „trauma“ und „prehospital“ durchgeführt. Eingeschlossen wurden Studien zur präklinischen Versorgung verletzter Kinder und Jugendlicher; von 421 Treffern wurden 20 Arbeiten ausgewählt und durch Rückwärtssuche ergänzt, mit Fokus auf Daten aus Deutschland und vergleichbaren Hochlohnländern. Pädiatrische Notfälle machen etwa 5 % der bodengebundenen und 6–13 % der luftgebundenen Einsätze aus; schwer verletzte Kinder (z. B. NACA IV–VII) stellen nur einen kleinen Bruchteil dar und machen das pädiatrische Polytrauma zu einem klassischen „Low-frequency-high-impact“-Szenario. Der Anteil traumatischer Notfälle steigt mit dem Alter und ist im Jugendalter am höchsten; Jungen sind in allen Kollektiven überrepräsentiert. Stürze und Verkehrsunfälle dominieren, überwiegend als stumpfe Traumata mit vorwiegend Kopf- und Extremitätenverletzungen. Ein Polytrauma wird nur bei rund 5 % der verletzten Kinder beschrieben und betrifft v. a. ältere Kinder und Jugendliche. Sauerstoffgabe, venöse Zugänge, Immobilisation und Analgesie gehören zu den häufigen Maßnahmen, während Intubation, intraossäre Zugänge, Thoraxdrainagen und andere invasive Prozeduren selten bleiben. Mehrere Studien belegen, dass Luftrettung sowie die primäre Aufnahme in ein (pädiatrisches) Traumazentrum mit einer verbesserten Überlebensrate assoziiert sind. Pädiatrische Traumapatienten bilden eine kleine, aber risikobehaftete Patientengruppe, bei der invasive Prozeduren unter Zeitdruck und emotionaler Belastung durchgeführt werden müssen. Die Versorgung komplexer Fälle durch spezialisierte HEMS-Teams und in klar ausgewiesenen (pädiatrischen) Traumazentren, eine gestärkte notfallsanitäterbasierte Versorgung, simulationsbasiertes Training und eine standardisierte prä- und innerklinisches Outcome-orientierte Datenerfassung sowie der weitere Ausbau regional koordinierter Traumanetzwerke sind zentrale Schritte zur Verbesserung der präklinischen Versorgung verletzter Kinder."

    "abstract": "Trauma registries provide essential insights into the quality of care for severely injured patients. This study compares key epidemiological, clinical and process-related parameters from Germany, Austria and Switzerland based on the respective national trauma registry data. A narrative descriptive analysis of the most recently available registry data was performed. For Germany (TR-DGU, 2023) and Austria (TR-ÖGU, 2023), only data from the core dataset were included [1, 2]. For Switzerland, in the absence of national annual reports, published analyses of the Swiss Trauma Registry (STR, 2015-2019; Costa et al.) were used, which exclusively include patients with an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16 and/or abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score of the head ≥ 3 [3, 4]. Due to differences in inclusion criteria and time periods, no inferential statistical comparisons were conducted. In 2023 Germany documented 31,217 patients in the core dataset, including 28,718 primary admissions (mean age 54.5 years, 69.6% male, mean ISS 18.5). The in-hospital mortality in the outcome cohort of 25,208 patients was 7.4% [1]. Austria reported 1060 cases in the same year (mean age 50.2 years, 73.8% male, mean ISS 22.6) with a mortality of 14.7% [2]. In Switzerland, the published STR analyses between 2015 and 2019 included a total of 13,222 patients (mean age 58 years, 68% male, mean ISS 22) with a mortality of 11.6% [3, 4]. While blunt trauma dominated in all three countries (> 90% in Germany and Austria, ≈ 94% estimated for Switzerland), prehospital structures differed: Germany and Austria rely on emergency physician-based systems, whereas Switzerland relies more on paramedics. Process parameters such as prehospital intubation, whole-body CT in the trauma room and transfusion rates vary between countries but overall indicate comparable clinical care pathways. Trauma care in the DACH region is broadly comparable but differs in patient demographics, case selection, trauma mechanisms and mortality. Because the STR data used in this study are derived exclusively from publications including only severely injured patients, the Swiss cohort by definition reflects a more severely injured population than the German and Austrian core datasets. Harmonized registry structures and joint analyses could enhance transnational learning and further improve the quality of care.

Ziel dieser Arbeit ist der Vergleich zentraler epidemiologischer, klinischer und prozessbezogener Parameter aus Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz anhand ihrer nationalen Traumaregister. Es wurde eine narrative, deskriptive Analyse der aktuell verfügbaren Registerdaten durchgeführt. Für Deutschland (TR-DGU, 2023) und Österreich (TR-ÖGU, 2023) wurden ausschließlich Daten des Basiskollektivs verwendet [1, 2]. Für die Schweiz wurden mangels Jahresberichten die publizierten Daten des Swiss Trauma Registry (STR, 2015–2019; Costa et al.) ausgewertet, die ausschließlich Fälle mit einem ISS ≥ 16 und/oder AIS des Kopfes ≥ 3 umfassen [3, 4]. Aufgrund unterschiedlicher Einschlusskriterien und Zeiträume wurde kein inferenzstatistischer Vergleich durchgeführt. Deutschland dokumentierte 2023 im Basiskollektiv 31.217 Patienten, davon 28.718 primär versorgt (Ø 54,5 Jahre, 69,6 % männlich, Ø ISS 18,5). In der Outcome-Kohorte von 25.208 Patienten lag die Krankenhausmortalität bei 7,4 % [1]. Österreich erfasste im selben Jahr 1060 Fälle (Ø 50,2 Jahre, 73,8 % männlich, Ø ISS 22,6) mit einer Mortalität von 14,7 % [2]. In der Schweiz wurden in den publizierten STR-Analysen zwischen 2015 und 2019 insgesamt 13.222 Patienten erfasst (Ø 58 Jahre, 68 % männlich, Ø ISS 22) mit einer Mortalität von 11,6 % [3, 4]. Während in allen 3 Ländern stumpfe Traumata dominieren (> 90 % in DE/AT, ≈ 94 % geschätzt aus Costa et al.), unterscheiden sich die prähospitalen Strukturen: Deutschland und Österreich setzen auf ein notarztbasiertes System, die Schweiz stärker auf Paramedics. Prozessparameter wie präklinische Intubation, Schockraum-CT oder Transfusionen variieren zwischen den Ländern, zeigen jedoch insgesamt vergleichbare Versorgungsabläufe. Die Traumaregister im DACH-Raum zeigen insgesamt vergleichbare Strukturen in der Versorgung schwer verletzter Patienten, unterscheiden sich jedoch in Altersprofil, Fallselektion, Mechanismen und Mortalität. Da für die Schweiz ausschließlich publizierte STR-Analysen verfügbar sind, die nur schwer verletzte Patienten einschließen, ist die Schweizer Kohorte definitionsgemäß schwerer verletzt als die deutschen und österreichischen Basiskollektive. Harmonisierte Registerstrukturen und gemeinsame Auswertungen könnten künftig dazu beitragen, länderübergreifend voneinander zu lernen und die Versorgungsqualität weiter zu verbessern."

    "abstract": "The decision to image children for cervical spine injuries (CSI), an uncommon injury with high associated morbidity and mortality, is complex. X-rays and computed tomography are often used to screen for CSI; however, radiation exposure increases lifetime cancer risk. We recently developed a CSI prediction rule to inform pediatric imaging decisions. To guide implementation, we conducted a workflow analysis of CSI screening in children after blunt trauma. We interviewed emergency departments (ED) and trauma clinicians at 21 hospitals following the applied cognitive task analysis task diagram, knowledge audit, and simulation interview approaches. Interviews were coded using a combined deductive-inductive approach to construct a workflow diagram and identify critical decisions with associated workflow junctures, decision makers, physical locations, and cognitive demands. We noted areas of high, medium, and low variability. We interviewed 48 participants (emergency medicine physicians and advanced practice providers [n = 22], nurses [n = 14], and surgeons [n = 12]) across 21 hospitals located in the Western (n = 15), Northeastern (n = 5), and Midwestern (n = 1) USA. Critical decisions within the pediatric CSI imaging decision workflow included trauma triaging, spinal motion restriction application, clinical clearance, decision to image, and imaging type. There was moderate-to-high variability between hospitals for most workflow junctures and decision makers. However, more consistent patterns emerged, such as a high level of ED and trauma attending involvement throughout the process. The knowledge audit revealed a heavy cognitive load associated with decision making. \"Big picture,\" \"past and future,\" \"noticing\", \"job smarts,\" and \"equipment\" were highly relevant cognitive demands. Moderate-to-high between-hospital variability in workflow for decision making around CSI evaluation for pediatric trauma patients could potentially complicate CSI prediction rule implementation."

    "title": "Transesophageal echocardiography in cardiac arrest: why, how, when, and where in clinical practice.",
    "abstract": "Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has emerged as a transformative tool in the management of cardiac arrest, offering significant advantages over traditional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) by enabling continuous, high-resolution cardiac imaging during resuscitation. Initially used in operating rooms before 2000, TEE expanded into emergency departments (EDs), intensive care units (ICUs), and even prehospital settings. Its superior imaging capability during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) supports rapid diagnosis, optimization of compression quality, and more accurate rhythm assessment, including the differentiation between asystole and fine ventricular fibrillation. TEE has been shown to influence intra-arrest clinical decision-making in up to 78% of cases, often revealing pathologies-such as aortic dissection or cardiac rupture-not detected by TTE. Importantly, TEE aids in identifying reversible causes of cardiac arrest, guiding high-quality CPR by assessing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and shortening the duration of pulse checks. It also may play a role in extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) and organ donation procedures, particularly in cannulation and monitoring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). TEE use is feasible and safe during cardiac arrest, with high insertion success rates and minimal complications when performed by trained personnel. While cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and intensivists traditionally perform TEE, simplified training protocols now enable emergency physicians to safely and effectively deploy TEE in critical settings. Protocols such as \"POCUS-TEE\" may promote rapid acquisition of essential views, facilitating broader implementation. Despite the potential benefits, several barriers to widespread adoption remain. These include the availability of equipment, limitations in training, and concerns regarding the safety of the probe during defibrillation. Resuscitation guidelines recommend removing the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) probe, or at least insulating it, as a precaution during defibrillation. TEE is particularly valuable when TTE proves inadequate, such as in obese or mechanically ventilated patients. In conclusion, TEE might enhance the quality and precision of resuscitation in cardiac arrest and has the potential to improve survival and neurological outcomes in selected cases. Its broader adoption hinges on institutional support, streamlined protocols, operator training, and further research to validate its impact on patient-centered outcomes. As technology advances and clinical integration improves, TEE may become a cornerstone of advanced life support in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings."

    "title": "Management of strangulated, perforated gastrothorax with resultant tension pneumothorax secondary to an iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic hernias arise when a defect in the diaphragmatic musculotendinous framework allows the abnormal protrusion of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity, which can be further complicated by visceral incarceration, strangulation, and perforation. Whilst the vast majority occur congenitally or are acquired through trauma, diaphragmatic hernias arising from iatrogenic insults represent an exceedingly rare but important clinical entity. Diagnostic challenges arise in large part due to their tendency towards delayed presentation, often with varied, nonspecific and subacute clinical manifestations, as well as equivocal or indeterminate radiographic findings. The report herein represents the inaugural account of an iatrogenic diaphragmatic hernia arising following thoracoscopic pleural endometriosis removal, which was subsequently complicated by gastric strangulation and perforation, culminating in a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. We describe a safe, effective approach to managing this surgical emergency using an entirely laparoscopic technique and relate our findings to the broader literature pertaining to complicated diaphragmatic hernias."

    "abstract": "Abdominal tuberculosis is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis (TB), one that is increasingly encountered at hospitals serving a growing immigrant population. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of TB has continually increased. The diagnostic differential often overlaps with inflammatory bowel disease, with diagnostic laparoscopy remaining the most effective modality of diagnosis. Additional diagnostic difficulties are encountered in patients unable to report symptoms. We present the case of a 52-year-old woman with cerebral palsy who presented initially with pulmonary symptoms and later developed massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Conservative management was attempted with angioembolization of a bleeding cecal mass on computed tomography. The patient initially improved and then decompensated after several hours. The patient then underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for resection of a bleeding ileocecal mass which was found to be abdominal tuberculosis on pathology."

    "abstract": "Trichobezoars are rare but significant causes of gastrointestinal obstruction in children, most commonly confined to the stomach. In certain cases, these bezoars can grow large enough to extend into the duodenum, resulting in severe gastrointestinal complications. A previously healthy 16-year-old female presented with an 8-hour history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed a palpable mass in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions. Paraclinical investigations, including laboratory tests and imaging, yielded no significant abnormalities. The patient subsequently underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy, which identified a large trichobezoar. An anterior gastrotomy was performed, and the bezoar was successfully removed in one piece. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 17, after tolerating a regular diet. She was referred for psychiatric evaluation to address underlying trichotillomania and trichophagia, with the goal of preventing recurrence. Rapunzel syndrome predominantly affects young females with underlying psychiatric conditions. Delayed diagnosis is common, often leading to serious gastrointestinal complications, including perforation, infections, cholangitis, obstructive jaundice, intussusception, and pancreatitis. Early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent these potentially life-threatening outcomes. Surgical removal through gastrotomy is typically required, particularly for large bezoars. Trichobezoars, though rare, present serious health risks when left untreated, especially in pediatric patients with underlying psychiatric disorders like trichotillomania and trichophagia. Prompt diagnosis and intervention, including surgical removal, are essential to avoid severe complications. This highlights the importance of early recognition and multidisciplinary care in managing trichobezoar-related gastrointestinal complications."

    "abstract": "This article evaluates the effectiveness and implementation of two clinical decision rules for assessing cervical spine injuries after blunt trauma: the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria and the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR). Both rules aim to reduce unnecessary imaging, which can be costly and expose patients to radiation, by identifying individuals at low risk who do not require cervical spine CT. The five NEXUS criteria are easy to apply but may have inconsistent interpretations. Although more complex and time-consuming, the CCR provides a structured algorithm to more effectively reduce unnecessary imaging. Both rules have high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant injuries. Potential pitfalls include incomplete documentation and variability in clinician interpretation, emphasizing the importance of proper training in implementing these rules. The American College of Radiology recommends CT as the initial imaging method for adults meeting NEXUS or CCR criteria. Pediatric clinical decision support rules vary by patient age and may use radiography and MRI in different instances, but older children are typically assessed like adults. With the increased availability of cervical spine CT, it is essential to improve imaging decisions with respect to patient impact and health care costs while minimizing radiation exposure, especially in younger patients."

    "abstract": "Subclavian artery injury is a rare complication of clavicular fracture. This condition most often results from penetrating trauma but may also occur after blunt injury, when bone fragments cause rupture, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or arterial thrombosis. Subclavian artery injury associated with clavicular fracture occurs in less than 1% of cases and may lead to life-threatening hemorrhage or limb ischemia. We report a case of subclavian artery injury secondary to a clavicular fracture that was successfully managed with endovascular intervention. A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department after a downhill bicycle crash with a right midshaft clavicle fracture and was scheduled for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) 11 days later. Intraoperatively, rupture of a subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm caused massive hemorrhage. Surgical dissection was complicated by severe perivascular inflammation and a high risk of iatrogenic subclavian vein injury. Immediate conversion to an endovascular approach allowed successful hemostasis through femoral artery access and covered stent deployment, after which ORIF was completed. The patient recovered without neurovascular complications and was discharged on postoperative day 5. At 12 weeks, he achieved full shoulder range of motion, and 2-year follow-up angiography showed no stent-related complications. This case underscores the effectiveness of emergent endovascular intervention for ruptured traumatic subclavian pseudoaneurysm when inflammation and risk of iatrogenic injury preclude safe open dissection. A hybrid or rescue endovascular strategy should be considered for similar complex trauma cases."

    "abstract": "Traumatic abdominal wall hernia, a rare condition resulting from blunt trauma, is characterized by disruption of the abdominal wall musculature and fascia without skin penetration. Given its rarity, standardized treatment guidelines are lacking, and the necessity for immediate surgery remains debated. This study examines high-energy posterolateral abdominal wall injuries (AWI), which pose significant management challenges due to their anatomical complexity and high recurrence risk. We retrospectively reviewed records of 44 adults with grade III-VI AWI treated between 2013 and 2023 at a level I trauma center. Patients were categorized into emergency repair or delayed management groups based on the initial treatment strategy, with injuries anatomically classified as anterior, lateral, or posterolateral. Nonoperative management (NOM) was limited to patients without herniation on index imaging and entailed close observation with regular follow-up imaging. AWI was identified in 44 of 83,532 patients (0.05%) with blunt trauma. Anatomically, 4 cases (9.1%) were anterior, 17 (38.6%) were lateral, and 23 (52.3%) were posterolateral. Three patients (6.8%) were classified as grade III injury, 16 (36.4%) as grade IV, 24 (54.6%) as grade V, and 1 (2.3%) as grade VI. Emergency repair was performed in 26 patients (59.1%), whereas 18 (40.9%) initially received delayed management. In the latter group, 8 of 18 patients (44.4%) were judged to require delayed repair, of whom six proceeded to surgery. Among 10 NOM patients with indeterminate muscle-layer integrity on initial imaging due to hematoma or tissue injury, follow-up revealed delayed hernia development in three, while seven had resolved hematoma, confirming wall integrity. In hemodynamically stable patients with traumatic posterolateral AWI without herniation, NOM with close monitoring and delayed repair for subsequent hernia appears safe and effective as an alternative to immediate surgery. Management should be tailored to injury location and patient condition. These findings inform the management timing and approach for this rare, challenging injury pattern."

    "abstract": "Pericardial effusion, although not uncommon in emergency contexts, poses detection and diagnostic challenges in prehospital and peripheral emergency settings where access to advanced imaging and specialist evaluation is limited. In its severe forms, rapid fluid accumulation may lead to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition requiring immediate recognition and intervention. The clinical course is often insidious, and the progression of symptoms may easily be mistaken for other, more common pathologies, further complicating timely diagnosis. We report the case of a patient who presented twice within two days to a Basic Emergency Service with central chest pain of five days' duration, low-grade fever, and subsequently worsening dyspnea. Given the persistence and evolution of symptoms, a bedside screening ultrasound was performed, which revealed a large pericardial effusion. The patient was urgently referred to a central hospital, where the diagnosis was confirmed, and appropriate management was instituted. This case illustrates the vital function of screening ultrasound in resource-limited environments: even when definitive treatment cannot be provided locally, early identification of critical findings supports timely referral and improves patient outcomes. Furthermore, the decision to employ or omit screening echocardiography in such contexts can significantly influence clinical pathways and ultimately alter patient prognosis, emphasizing its relevance as a low-cost, rapidly deployable screening tool, while also stressing that patient outcomes may depend on the availability of a trained sonographer/radiographer capable of performing the examination."

    "abstract": "Hemorrhagic shock remains a leading cause of preventable trauma-related deaths, highlighting the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis. This study evaluates whether integrating inferior vena cava ultrasound (IVC-US) into the extended focused assessment with Sonography for trauma (eFAST), referred to as \"e²FAST,\" improves early shock detection and guides fluid resuscitation in trauma patients. A comprehensive narrative review was conducted to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of IVC-US as a rapid diagnostic tool for hemorrhagic shock in trauma patients. Studies published from 2000 to January 2025 were searched across PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases. Studies were included if they involved adult trauma patients and evaluated IVC diameter or the collapsibility index (IVC-CI) to determine volume status, shock, or fluid responsiveness. Two independent reviewers screened and selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. In total, 13 eligible studies, including randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohorts, and cross-sectional analyses, were reviewed qualitatively. Key outcomes extracted included diagnostic accuracy, fluid responsiveness, transfusion requirements, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. IVC-US demonstrated a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 75% in detecting hypovolemia. A smaller IVC diameter (<1.5 cm) was significantly associated with increased ICU admissions (51.3%), higher transfusion rates (12.2%), increased emergency surgery requirements (16.2%), and elevated mortality (13.5%). Additionally, an IVC-CI greater than 38.5% provided 80% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity for predicting fluid responsiveness in patients with major blunt trauma. Post-resuscitation assessments (IVC-CI ≤28.6%) were predictive of fluid unresponsiveness (80% sensitivity, 75% specificity). Moreover, IVC-US reliably predicted 24-hour fluid requirements, helping in real-time fluid management. Integrating IVC-US into the eFAST as the e²FAST protocol enhances diagnostic accuracy for identifying hemorrhagic shock and provides critical real-time guidance for fluid resuscitation. Given its non-invasive nature, reliability, and predictive value for patient outcomes, standardized inclusion of IVC measurements in trauma protocols is recommended. Future research should prioritize multicenter randomized trials and standardized operator training to minimize variability and support broad clinical implementation."

    "abstract": "Traumatic cardiac arrest represents 1 of the most challenging emergencies in trauma care, historically associated with dismal survival and frequent perceptions of futility. This narrative review synthesizes contemporary evidence on the epidemiology, prognostic determinants, and management strategies for traumatic cardiac arrest, with emphasis on prehospital interventions and trauma system organization. This review was reported in accordance with the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles to support methodological transparency and reporting quality. PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched to identify studies addressing the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of traumatic cardiac arrest. Eligible sources included registry analyses, observational studies, reviews, consensus documents, and position statements. Evidence was narratively synthesized to identify consistencies, gaps, and operational priorities across emergency medical services systems. Reported survival after traumatic cardiac arrest remains low, generally <10%, although selected subgroups demonstrate higher survival depending on mechanism of injury, system configuration, and availability of advanced interventions. Prognosis is strongly influenced by early correction of reversible causes such as hemorrhage, hypoxemia, tension pneumothorax, and cardiac tamponade, summarized in the hypovolemia, oxygenation impairment, tension pneumothorax, and tamponade framework. Evidence demonstrates variable effectiveness of conventional chest compressions and vasopressors, while supporting early thoracic decompression, hemostatic resuscitation, and prehospital blood product administration. Physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical services teams may provide additional benefit through early definitive interventions, although substantial heterogeneity persists across trauma systems. Despite persistently high mortality, outcomes may improve when reversible causes are corrected rapidly, hemostatic resuscitation is initiated early, and system-level coordination is optimized. Current evidence remains heterogeneous and predominantly observational; future research should validate cause-first algorithms, refine prognostic tools, and evaluate prehospital strategies and emergency nursing practices for traumatic cardiac arrest management across diverse emergency medical services systems and emergency care settings."

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine is a potent sympathomimetic agent primarily associated with cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric effects. However, its gastrointestinal complications, particularly ischemic bowel disease, are under-recognized in emergency medicine literature. A 34-year-old man with a history of chronic methamphetamine use presented to the emergency department (ED) seeking medical clearance for rehabilitation admission. He also reported mild, diffuse abdominal pain persisting for three days. Vital signs revealed tachycardia and hypotension. Physical examination showed mild subjective diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. Laboratory studies indicated leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and acute kidney injury. Non-contrast abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) demonstrated pneumoperitoneum and extensive mesenteric stranding consistent with ischemia. The patient was managed with intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and emergent surgical consultation. Exploratory laparotomy revealed hemoperitoneum, a large abscess cavity, necrosis of the cecum, and mesenteric ischemia. A resection of the cecum and terminal ileum was performed. Postoperatively, the patient required intensive care management for septic shock and renal failure but eventually recovered and was discharged after 15 days. This case underscores the importance of considering chronic methamphetamine use as a potential etiology for gastrointestinal ischemia and sepsis, even in patients presenting with subtle abdominal complaints. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes in this high-risk population."

    "abstract": "This report presents a rare case of pneumorrhachis, pneumothorax, and pneumocephalus in a patient with multiple traumatic injuries following a gunshot wound to the chest. Pneumorrhachis, the presence of air within the spinal canal, can arise from iatrogenic, nontraumatic, or traumatic causes and is classified as extradural or intradural, the latter often linked to severe trauma. Pneumothorax, air in the pleural space, may impair ventilation and presents as simple, communicating, or tension types, with causes including trauma, iatrogenesis, or spontaneous events. Pneumocephalus, an accumulation of gas within the neurocranium, typically resolves spontaneously but rarely occurs in combination with pneumothorax after thoracic gunshot trauma. This report aims to elucidate the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of air migration and highlight the multidisciplinary management challenges inherent in this rare traumatic triad. A 45-year-old Syrian male presented with multiple traumatic injuries following a gunshot wound to the chest. Initial assessment revealed respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, and decreased oxygen saturation. Clinical evaluation and imaging confirmed a tension pneumothorax, which was treated with an emergent chest tube placement. Subsequent computed tomography scans showed extensive pneumocephalus, with air pockets in the intracranial cavity, and pneumorrhachis, with air tracking along the spinal canal. Both findings were attributed to the high-pressure air leakage through fascial planes and anatomical pathways caused by the penetrating trauma. The patient was managed with supplemental oxygen, careful neurological monitoring, and supportive care. Despite the severe injuries, his condition stabilized, and no surgical intervention was required for the pneumorrhachis or pneumocephalus, which resolved spontaneously over time. However, the patient's clinical course was complicated by persistent infection and respiratory failure, and he ultimately succumbed to his injuries 3 months after admission. The coexistence of pneumorrhachis, pneumothorax, and pneumocephalus following chest gunshot trauma is exceedingly rare. This case underscores the importance of early recognition, prompt imaging, and multidisciplinary care in managing such complex injuries, contributing valuable insights to the limited literature on these conditions."

This case series reports on adults with penetrating head and neck injuries caused by airbag malfunctions, treated at a maxillofacial trauma center in Paris, France, from November 2021 to September 2024. We also performed a literature review of cases published from 1992 to 2024, focusing on similar penetrating injuries. Three cases of penetrating trauma were analyzed, highlighting complex facial injuries requiring extensive surgical interventions, including reconstructions with free flaps. The literature review revealed seven reported cases, predominantly affecting young males, with high mortality rates due to vascular injuries from foreign bodies. The findings underscore the severe consequences of airbag malfunctions, emphasizing the need for urgent medical interventions and reconstructive surgeries. This case series calls for a reevaluation of airbag safety standards to prevent future injuries and ensure enhanced training for healthcare providers managing such trauma."

Its incidental discovery during emergent trauma surgery is rare. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who sustained blunt abdominal trauma in a dirt-bike accident, presenting to the emergency department the same day with progressive abdominal pain. Emergent exploratory laparotomy for a suspected bowel perforation revealed characteristic \"creeping fat,\" inflammatory adhesions, and an enterocolonic fistula, suggesting undiagnosed Crohn's disease. The presence of acute inflammation necessitated extended small bowel resection and precluded primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient developed recurrent intra-abdominal abscesses, including a subhepatic collection measuring 5.7 × 2.6 × 5 cm, as well as pleural effusions, necessitating multiple drainage procedures, targeted antibiotics, and nutritional optimization. A multidisciplinary team-including trauma surgeons, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, and interventional radiologists-collaborated to manage both acute injuries and the newly recognized chronic inflammatory condition. Final pathology revealed multifocal colonic mucosal ulceration with acute inflammation, ileocolic fistula formation, and colonic perforation, consistent with a penetrating (fistulizing) phenotype, ileocolonic Crohn's disease. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a broad diagnostic perspective during trauma surgery and highlights how an unrecognized inflammatory bowel disease can complicate postoperative recovery. Early suspicion and tailored interventions are crucial for mitigating complications such as abscess formation and sepsis. A prompt gastroenterology consult and confirmatory investigations are recommended to guide long-term management of Crohn's disease. Ultimately, this report underscores that vigilance for atypical findings in emergent settings can significantly improve patient outcomes."

Point-of-care cardiac ultrasound (POCUS) revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with a \"swinging heart\" and diastolic collapse of the right chambers, consistent with cardiac tamponade. Urgent ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis drained thick purulent fluid, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Targeted intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated. Following drainage, the patient showed clear clinical improvement, including stabilization of blood pressure, improved oxygen saturation, reduction of tachycardia, and resolution of chest pain. Residual loculated collections required pleural drainage and a video-assisted thoracoscopic pericardial window.

    "abstract": "Penetrating trauma stands out as the predominant cause of vascular injury in the upper extremity, with the brachial artery being the vessel most frequently affected. While in the pediatric population, a traumatic injury to the brachial artery usually results from a distal humerus fracture; such scenarios are exceptionally reported in the adult population. We report the case of a 21-year-old woman who sustained a comminuted displaced distal humerus fracture associated with a weak radial pulse with no other ischemia signs. Only following open reduction and internal fixation did she present all signs of an acute ischemic limb. An emergency surgery showed a complex brachial artery injury over 3 cm of length. The vascular repair using a venous graft yielded a complete recovery of the patient. While brachial artery injury may be associated with distal humerus fractures in the pediatric population, this complication is exceedingly rare in adults. Our surgical case report serves as a call for clinicians to maintain a heightened awareness and suspicion for brachial artery injury, particularly in cases of severe elbow fractures. The absence of full signs of limb ischemia, owing to a rich collateral blood supply, underscores the importance of careful consideration and proactive management to address this serious complication."

He had progressive easy fatigability over the last three months. An external chest X-ray indicated a globular heart, suggestive of pericardial effusion to rule out cardiomyopathy. Cardiac POCUS revealed a massive pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. Immediate ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed, draining 800 ml of purulent fluid, followed by an additional 200 ml with an underwater seal setup. Post-procedure, serial POCUS examinations were conducted to monitor for adequate drainage and to detect any possible re-accumulation of pericardial fluid. The symptoms resolved, and a 2-week follow-up showed sustained improvement.

Understanding its incidence, indications, and outcomes is crucial for improving patient care and surgical safety. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of re-exploratory laparotomies over a 10-year period in a major tertiary care center. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients who underwent re-exploratory laparotomy following obstetric or gynecological surgery between 2014 and 2024. Data on patient demographics, primary surgery, indications for re-exploration, time to re-intervention, procedures performed, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and t-tests to identify significant associations. A total of 117 cases of re-exploratory laparotomy were identified. The mean age of patients was 31.8 ± 7.0 years. The most common primary surgeries were Cesarean Sect. (46.2%) and total abdominal hysterectomy (23.1%). The leading indications for re-exploration were postpartum hemorrhage (26.5%), muscle hematoma (20.5%), and burst abdomen (17.1%). The mean time to re-exploration was 4.7 ± 2.7 days. The overall mortality rate was 8.5%, and the postoperative complication rate was 46.2%. No significant association was found between the level of emergency and patient outcome (p = 0.637). Re-exploratory laparotomy remains a critical event in obstetric and gynecological practice, with hemorrhage and postoperative wound complications being the primary drivers.

This was an observational study of dogs presenting to a university-based emergency department between August 2021 and March 2022 within 2 hours of traumatic injury and healthy, age-matched controls. We obtained EDTA plasma at arrival and 3, 6, and 24 hours later. Degree of injury was classified based on Animal Trauma Triage score (mild, 0 to 3; moderate, 4 to 6; and severe, ≥ 7). Data collected included signalment, modified Glasgow Coma Scale score, interventions, diagnostic results, and patient outcomes. Plasma concentrations of syndecan-1, hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, and vascular endothelial-cadherin (cadherin-5) were determined via ELISA. 19 canine trauma patients and 16 age-matched controls were enrolled. Hyaluronan was significantly lower at arrival versus 24 hours later and demonstrated a significant increase over all time points. There was a significant negative correlation between heparan sulfate and lactate. Vascular endothelial cadherin was significantly higher in penetrating trauma than blunt trauma at arrival and 6 hours later. Measurement of the 4 markers of endothelial glycocalyx damage in canine trauma patients was generally feasible, and further study may determine clinical application. This was the first evaluation of these glycocalyx biomarkers in canine trauma patients. Additional studies evaluating these and other glycocalyx biomarkers longitudinally are needed to determine the effect of injury and fluid resuscitation on the glycocalyx and outcome in canine trauma patients."

Although diaphragmatic hernias can be congenital, traumatic, or iatrogenic, colonic herniation and subsequent perforation into the thoracic cavity are exceedingly uncommon and diagnostically challenging. We report the case of a 53-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, admitted to the emergency department (ED) with severe respiratory distress. Despite multiple prior visits to the ED with nonspecific symptoms, this time the patient presented in shock. Chest radiography revealed a left-sided tension pneumothorax, and insertion of a chest tube resulted in the unexpected drainage of feculent material. Computed tomography confirmed a left hydropneumothorax secondary to central diaphragmatic hernia with intrathoracic colonic perforation. Emergency surgery included segmental colectomy with colostomy, diaphragmatic repair, and chest tube placement. Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. Despite subsequent improvement, a secondary empyema necessitated repeat drainage. Persistent infection and loss of lung viability led to left lower lobectomy. After 65 days of hospitalization and a multidisciplinary approach involving intensivists and surgical teams, the patient was discharged with a favorable clinical evolution. This case highlights the diagnostic complexity and severity of tension faecopneumothorax due to colonic perforation in a diaphragmatic hernia, particularly in the absence of trauma. It underscores the importance of considering atypical etiologies in patients with unexplained respiratory distress and the need for prompt imaging, surgical intervention, and comprehensive intensive care. Given the rarity of such presentations, reporting these cases contributes to improved clinical awareness and management strategies."

    "abstract": "Purulent pericarditis is a rare but life-threatening condition, and Salmonella Typhimuriumis an uncommon pathogen. Its simultaneous occurrence with a mycotic aortic aneurysm is exceptionally rare and has been documented only in a very limited number of cases. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman with long-standing systemic lupus erythematosus managed with chronic corticosteroid therapy who presented with fever and pleuritic chest pain. Laboratory tests showed elevated inflammatory markers, and the electrocardiogram demonstrated diffuse ST-segment elevation with PR-segment depression. She was diagnosed with acute pericarditis and discharged with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Nine days later, she returned with recurrent fever, chest pain, dyspnea, and orthopnea. Computed tomography revealed a large pericardial effusion and a saccular aneurysm of the aortic arch. Given the presence of arterial hypotension and echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade, urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with drainage of purulent fluid, and intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated on the first day. Pericardial fluid culture isolated Salmonella Typhimurium. Despite clinical and laboratory improvement, serial echocardiograms demonstrated progressive features of constrictive pericarditis. Due to the evolving constrictive pericarditis and the concomitant presence of a mycotic aortic arch aneurysm at risk of rupture, complete pericardiectomy and aortic arch replacement were performed. This case illustrates an exceptionally rare presentation of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella infection manifesting exclusively with extra-intestinal symptoms and complications (purulent pericarditis and a mycotic aortic aneurysm). Early recognition, prompt pericardial drainage, targeted antibiotic therapy, and timely surgical intervention were essential for a favorable outcome, especially in an immunosuppressed patient."

    "abstract": "Tuberculous pericarditis (TBP) is a rare but potentially life-threatening manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in regions with low tuberculosis (TB) prevalence. It accounts for a small fraction of pericardial effusion cases in high-income countries, yet remains a significant diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific presentation and overlap with other infectious, inflammatory, or malignant causes. Here, we present a case of a tuberculous pericarditis in a 32-year-old male, originally from Congo, who presented with constitutional symptoms, pleuritic chest pain, and tachycardia shortly after migrating to the United Kingdom from South Africa. Initial investigations revealed a large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade, prompting urgent pericardiocentesis and further imaging. This case reinforces the need for timely recognition, multidisciplinary management, and public health awareness to mitigate the morbidity associated with tuberculous pericarditis."

    "abstract": "Pylephlebitis is an uncommon but severe complication of intra-abdominal infections, particularly associated with conditions such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. Although it is more frequently observed in older men, it can occur in other age groups and carries significant mortality if not diagnosed in a timely manner. Acute appendicitis remains the leading cause of emergency abdominal surgery worldwide, with a higher risk of complications in elderly patients due to diagnostic challenges. Situs inversus totalis, an unusual anatomical condition, may delay diagnosis by altering the clinical location of symptoms. We report the case of a geriatric patient with previously undiagnosed situs inversus totalis who developed complicated appendicitis with pylephlebitis and hepatic abscess, highlighting the clinical and therapeutic challenges of this combination."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy, the coexistence of an intrauterine and an ectopic gestation, remains a rare but potentially life-threatening condition in spontaneous conceptions. Its diagnosis is often delayed due to the misleading reassurance provided by the confirmation of an intrauterine pregnancy. We report the case of a 41-year-old gravida 6, para 3 woman with a history of triple-scarred uterus and prior ectopic pregnancy, who presented in hemorrhagic shock at 5 weeks and 4 days of gestation. Initial transabdominal ultrasound identified an intrauterine gestational sac and a suspected ruptured adnexal mass. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a ruptured right tubal ectopic pregnancy with massive hemoperitoneum. A right salpingectomy and hemostatic uterine curettage were performed, and the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilization. This case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of heterotopic pregnancy in spontaneous conception, the importance of systematic adnexal assessment even after identifying an intrauterine pregnancy, and the need for urgent surgical intervention in hemodynamically unstable patients. Preservation of the intrauterine pregnancy remains a primary consideration when feasible; however, maternal stabilization is paramount. Early recognition and prompt surgical management are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with heterotopic pregnancy. Increased vigilance is warranted, particularly in patients with risk factors such as prior ectopic pregnancy or tubal pathology."

    "abstract": "Cocaine inhalation is a known cause of various pulmonary complications, both acute and chronic, including spontaneous pneumothorax, which may be exacerbated by unrecognized underlying lung diseases such as bronchiectasis or emphysema. We report the case of a 33-year-old man with a history of chronic cocaine use who presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and right-sided chest pain. Imaging revealed a right-sided tension pneumothorax associated with bronchiectatic changes and bullous emphysema, likely secondary to previous pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient was treated conservatively with chest drainage, resulting in marked clinical improvement. This case underscores that cocaine-induced pneumothorax, though rare, should be suspected in young adults presenting with acute respiratory distress in the absence of trauma. Deep inhalation, Valsalva maneuvers, and barotrauma may contribute to alveolar rupture, while cocaine use can unmask or worsen chronic pulmonary damage. Clinicians should systematically assess for underlying structural lung disease, especially post-tuberculosis changes, to guide management and prevent recurrence through pleurodesis or drug cessation."

    "abstract": "Needle thoracostomy (NT) is a frontline intervention for suspected tension pneumothorax in prehospital trauma care. The necessity for intervention in patients with relative indications is unclear, and locoregional protocols guiding NT placement by prehospital personnel vary. This study aims to identify factors associated with a positive response to NT and how often objective measures are utilized to prompt intervention, which may help better define indications for the procedure. A retrospective review of adult trauma patient who received prehospital needle decompression was performed utilizing the trauma registry database from a level 1ACS accredited trauma center in Omaha, Nebraska. A positive response was defined as increased oxygen saturation by 10 %, increased systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg, improved ventilation or breath sounds, or return of spontaneous circulation. A total of 214 patients were included, with an overall mortality rate of 52 % of which 144 (68 %) sustained blunt trauma and 67 (32 %) penetrating trauma. Mortality was 49 % for blunt trauma and 60 % for penetrating trauma (p = 0.182). Only 63 patients (30 %) responded to NT with an improvement in clinical parameters. The most common indication(s) for NT was documented as absent/reduced breath sounds (n = 118, 55 %), CPR (n = 79, 37 %), and hypoxia (n = 40, 19 %). After excluding patients with CPR en route (n = 135/214, 63 %), positive NT response increased to 48 % and overall mortality rate decreased to 26 %. There was no significant change in systolic blood pressure (mean difference: 0.3 mm Hg, 95 % CI:4.8-5.3, p = 0.910) or heart rate (-1.1 bpm, 95 % CI:5.8-3.6, p = 0.650) post-decompression. The incidence of hypoxia decreased from 68 % to 48 % (p < 0.001). Complications were identified in 14 % of patients and one patient did have a needle inserted into the heart, required a cardiac operation, and had subsequent anoxic brain injury. This study highlights the low success rates of prehospital NT, with the majority of procedures being performed based on subjective indicators. Prehospital protocols should be refined by incorporating objective criteria, such as confirmed hypoxia, to better identify patients who may benefit from NT."

    "abstract": "Orbital emphysema commonly occurs following traumatic orbital fractures, which usually resolve spontaneously. However, in rare cases, it can progress to tension orbital emphysema, leading to orbital compartment syndrome (OCS), a potentially blinding condition if not treated promptly. We report a 47-year-old man who developed OCS one day after sustaining blunt trauma to his right cheek. Initial examination revealed periorbital hematoma, emphysema, chemosis, and a raised intraocular pressure (IOP) of 28 mmHg without proptosis. Computed tomography showed a right orbital floor blowout fracture with orbital emphysema. His condition worsened the following day with a new onset of proptosis, total ophthalmoplegia, and an IOP of 48 mmHg. Emergency right lateral canthotomy and systemic acetazolamide reduced IOP to 28 mmHg, with full recovery after five days with 6/9 visual acuity, no relative afferent pupillary defect, resolved chemosis, normalized IOP and full range of extraocular movement. He remained stable for two weeks, after which he was lost to follow-up. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and prompt management of tension orbital emphysema to prevent permanent visual loss."

    "abstract": "Severe hypothyroidism is a recognised but uncommon cause of large serous effusions, and massive pericardial involvement with haemodynamic compromise remains particularly rare. We describe a 39-year-old woman presenting with progressive dyspnoea, peripheral oedema, and abdominal distension. Imaging revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion measuring 5.8 cm with tamponade physiology, accompanied by bilateral pleural effusions and ascites. Serum CA-125 was markedly elevated, prompting concurrent oncologic and endocrine evaluation. She underwent emergency pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade before the underlying cause was known, which yielded serous, non-malignant fluid with benign cytology. Cardiac, hepatic, and renal investigations were unremarkable, and subsequent endocrine testing confirmed severe primary hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) >150 mIU/L, undetectable free thyroxine) with positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies, consistent with autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The patient was commenced on combined levothyroxine and liothyronine therapy, after which she developed brief self-limiting generalised seizures attributed to mild hyponatraemia during metabolic recovery. With gradual thyroid hormone replacement, her cardiovascular function stabilised and all serous effusions resolved completely. This case highlights a rare presentation of severe autoimmune hypothyroidism with massive pericardial effusion causing tamponade, multi-serosal involvement, and transient metabolic seizures, demonstrating its ability to mimic malignant or systemic disease while remaining fully reversible with timely endocrine therapy."

    "abstract": "There are few reports of time effect for postoperative outcomes in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) complicated by malperfusion syndrome (MPS), especially transfer time difference from diagnosis to operation room (OR). To elucidate whether time between diagnosis and OR might be a significant factor, this study evaluated surgical outcomes of ATAAD complicated by MPS. Between October 2013 and June 2024, 159 patients with ATAAD underwent emergent aortic repair; 54.7% (87/159) presented with MPS, 45.3% (72/159) without MPS. Of 87 patients with MPS, 69.0% (60/87) were transferred to the OR within 150 minutes from initial diagnosis (immediate repair), whereas 31.0% (27/87) were transferred to the OR after 150 minutes (late repair). In the MPS group, there was a significant difference in 30-day mortality rate between immediate and late repair, 20.0% (12/60) vs 48.1% (13/27; P < .01). Mean follow-up time was 33.0 ± 35.8 months. Cumulative survival rate in 5 years of patients with MPS was 64.6% for immediate repair and 46.1% for late repair. A significant difference was noted in long-term outcome between the groups (P = .03), whereas there was no difference in the non-MPS group (P = .11). On multivariable Cox regression analysis, age >65 years, cardiac tamponade, and late aortic repair were associated with increased long-term mortality (P = .02, .02, and <.01). Immediate transfer from diagnosis to OR significantly improved long-term outcome in patients with ATAAD complicated by MPS. Older age and preoperative cardiac tamponade worsened long-term mortality in this cohort."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a frequently silent congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. While complications such as bleeding and obstruction are more common, traumatic perforation remains extremely rare, particularly from penetrating injuries. To date, isolated perforation of MD following self-inflicted abdominal stab wounds has been reported only sporadically. We present the case of a 39-year-old male with a long-standing history of schizophrenia and epilepsy who arrived at the emergency department following his fifth self-inflicted abdominal stab injury over the past decade. On physical examination, a segment of small bowel was found protruding from a 4 cm periumbilical wound. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed extensive intra-abdominal adhesions and an isolated perforation of a Meckel's diverticulum located 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. No other visceral injuries or hemorrhage were detected. The diverticulum was resected using a linear stapler, and serosal defects were repaired. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day five. Isolated MD perforation caused by penetrating abdominal trauma is exceedingly rare and diagnostically challenging. When occurring in psychiatric patients with repetitive self-harm behavior, it presents an even more complex scenario. This case underscores the importance of meticulous intra-abdominal exploration in stab wound patients and contributes novel insight to the limited literature on traumatic MD injuries. Meckel divertikülü (MD), gastrointestinal sistemin en yaygın konjenital anomalilerinden biridir, ancak komplikasyonlarla birlikte görülme sıklığı düşüktür. MD perforasyonu genellikle divertikülit, ülserasyon veya yabancı cisim ile ilişkilidir. Travmatik perforasyon, özellikle penetran abdominal yaralanmalar sonucu gelişen izole MD hasarı ise son derece nadirdir. Bu makalede, tekrarlayan kendine zarar verme davranışı gösteren psikiyatrik bir hastada, yalnızca Meckel divertikülüne sınırlı, diğer intraabdominal yapılarda hasar gözlenmeyen bir bıçaklanma yaralanmasına bağlı MD perforasyonu sunulmuştur. Otuzlu yaşlarında erkek hasta, acil servise karın ağrısı ve önceki bıçaklanma girişimlerine benzer yeni bir bıçaklanma travması ile başvurdu. Fizik muayene, hassasiyet ve defans ile uyumlu klinik bulgular gösterdi. Bilgisayarlı tomografi, net bir perforasyon bulgusu içermemekle birlikte bağırsak anslarında segmenter distansiyon ve sıvı izlenimi nedeniyle hasta acil laparotomiye alındı. Operasyon sırasında, ileoçekal valvden yaklaşık 60 cm proksimalde yer alan Meckel divertikülünde tek başına perforasyon saptandı. Diğer intestinal yapılar sağlamdı. Perfore MD segmenti rezeksiyonla çıkarıldı ve histopatolojik inceleme, heterotopik mukoza veya neoplazi içermeyen perfore divertikül tanısını doğruladı. Hastanın postoperatif dönemi sorunsuz geçti ve stabil klinik durumda taburcu edildi. Olgu, hem travmatik MD perforasyonlarının tanısal güçlüklerini hem de psikiyatrik hastalarda abdominal travmaların yönetiminde dikkat edilmesi gereken ayırıcı tanıları vurgulamaktadır. Literatürde çok az sayıda benzer vaka bildirilmiş olup, bu olgu serisi travma cerrahlarının klinik farkındalığını artırmak amacıyla literatür bilgileri ile karşılaştırmalı olarak sunulmuştur."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital small-bowel anomaly and is usually asymptomatic. However, torsion of Meckel's diverticulum is an extremely rare complication that can mimic other acute abdominal conditions such as appendicitis or small-bowel obstruction, posing a clinical challenge to surgeons that may result in misdiagnosis, especially in the absence of advanced imaging. A 16-year-old Syrian male patient presented to the emergency department with 24-hour duration of severe right lower quadrant pain, vomiting, nausea, and 2-day history of obstipation. Physical examination showed abdominal distention and tenderness in McBurney's point, while plain abdominal X-ray showed air-fluid levels consist with small bowel obstruction. Computed tomography was not conducted since the device was out of service. Initial diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made on the basis of the clinical findings, and the patient underwent surgery, revealing a normal appendix, prompting exploratory laparotomy where a giant torsed Meckel's diverticulum with necrosis was demonstrated 45 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, measuring 7 × 4 × 3 cm. The torsed diverticulum was excised through enterectomy and an end-to-end anastomosis was performed without complications. Postoperative intravenous antibiotics were given (please refer to Graphical Abstract). This case demonstrates that torsion of Meckel's diverticulum can mimic appendicitis and present with small-bowel obstruction and may only be identified during surgery, particularly when advanced imaging is inaccessible. Clinicians should remain vigilant regarding Meckel's diverticulum and its differential diagnoses in young patients with right lower‑quadrant pain and perform diagnostic exploration if deemed necessary."

    "abstract": "Suturing techniques play a crucial role in wound healing and the overall outcome of surgical procedures. The debate between the effectiveness of interrupted versus continuous suturing techniques remains unresolved. This study aims to compare the outcomes of these two suturing methods in terms of Burst Abdomen in patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy, with a focus on personalized surgical strategies. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of General Surgery BPS GMC Khanpur. Ninety patients requiring emergency midline laparotomy were randomized into two groups: Group A (Interrupted Closure) and Group B (Continuous Closure). The rectus sheath was closed using No. 1 Prolene suture, either interrupted or continuous. The primary outcome was the incidence of wound dehiscence, with secondary outcomes including closure time and patient demographics. The overall incidence of burst abdomen was higher in the continuous group (14.4%) compared to the interrupted group (6.7%), though this was not statistically significant (p = 0.071). The time taken for rectus closure was significantly longer in the interrupted group (mean 28.36 min) compared to the continuous group (mean 17.31 min, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly lower incidence of burst abdomen in patients with tubercular perforation peritonitis in the interrupted group (7.7%) compared to the continuous group (57.1%, p = 0.01). The Study showed that interrupted closure technique showed a lower incidence of burst abdomen and preferred in tubercular perforation peritonitis although it requires more time for closure."

    "abstract": "Frailty is prevalent among geriatric patients and is a risk factor for worse outcomes in this population. The aim of this study is to provide setting-specific evidence by comparing outcomes of emergent laparotomy between frail and nonfrail geriatric blunt trauma patients. A 5-y (2017-2021) retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program was performed. Older adult (age ≥65 y) blunt trauma patients who underwent emergent laparotomy were included and stratified using the 11-factor modified frailty index into frail (F) and nonfrail (NF) groups. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS), and major complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, sepsis, surgical site infection, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses, adjusting for potential confounding factors, were performed. We identified a total of 1655 geriatric blunt trauma patients who underwent laparotomy (F: 273, NF: 1382). The mean age was 74 (7) y and 66% were male. The median injury severity score was 14 [9-25] and the median time to laparotomy was 112 [52-223] min. There was no significant difference in terms of injury characteristics and time to laparotomy between F and NF groups. On univariate analysis, there was no difference in terms of mortality (P = 0.161), intensive care unit LOS (P = 0.204), and major complications (P = 0.969); however, F group had significantly longer median hospital LOS (F: 10 [5-15] versus NF: 8 [2-14], P = 0.001). On multivariable regression analysis, F group was independently associated with higher odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.665, 95% confidence interval [1.194-2.321], P = 0.003) and longer hospital LOS (β: +2.131, 95% confidence interval [+0.492 to +3.771], P = 0.011). In older adults undergoing emergent laparotomy after blunt trauma, frailty identifies patients at increased risk of in-hospital mortality and prolonged length of stay; incorporating frailty assessment at presentation can guide perioperative counseling and resource planning."

    "abstract": "Firearm-related injuries have become the leading cause of death for US children. Although a \"volume-outcome\" relationship is well-established in adults, it is less understood in pediatric penetrating trauma. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between trauma center volume and patient outcomes in pediatric penetrating injuries. Utilizing the National Trauma Data Bank (2017-2021), we conducted a retrospective database study of pediatric patients (1-18 y) with stab or gunshot wounds (GSWs), treated at level I or II trauma centers. Patients with GSW to the head, interfacility transfers, or emergency department deaths were excluded. Trauma centers were categorized into quartiles based on penetrating injury volume. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit length of stay, and ventilator dependency duration. Of 666,111 patients, 34,064 with penetrating trauma were included, with 22,237 sustaining GSW. In-hospital mortality (4%-5%) did not significantly differ across volume quartiles. Patients at the highest-volume facilities (q4) experienced longer intensive care unit stays (4.33 d in q1 versus 5.45 d in q4, P < 0.001) and longer ventilator duration (3.22 d in q1 versus 4.90 d in q4, P < 0.001). After 3:1 matching to minimize confounding, prolonged ventilator dependency remained statistically significant in q4 facilities (relative risk = 1.256, P = 0.008), a trend also seen in the GSW subgroup (relative risk = 1.264, P = 0.016). This study indicates that while trauma center volume may influence resource utilization for pediatric penetrating trauma, it does not significantly affect in-hospital mortality. Further research with more anatomically precise injury matching is warranted."

This raises concerns about the preparedness of the German healthcare system for such scenarios, particularly in terms of personnel and structural resources for the treatment of penetrating injuries, which are typical for the military context. An online survey was distributed via email to members of the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV). Respondents were asked about structural prerequisites in emergency care capabilities at their institutions and personal experiences managing penetrating trunk injuries (n = 411; 94.6% from civilian hospitals). Despite increasing specialization 34% of visceral surgeons reported performing emergency thoracotomy themselves. Access to a thoracic surgeon is available in only 50% of the hospitals and to a cardiac surgeon in 26%. The majority of respondents felt inadequately prepared to manage penetrating injuries, especially those resembling military trauma patterns (e.g., shrapnel, blast injuries) as opposed to civilian gunshot wounds. Given these findings and the evolving geopolitical and security landscape, basic military surgical knowledge must be more broadly disseminated and systematically integrated into national emergency preparedness and disaster response frameworks in order to strengthen the capability for treatment in exceptional situations. HINTERGRUND: Der russische Angriff auf die Ukraine hat Deutschland mit der medizinischen Versorgung kriegsverletzter Soldaten und Zivilisten konfrontiert. Dies wirft die Frage auf, wie gut das deutsche Gesundheitssystem auf solche Szenarien vorbereitet ist – insbesondere hinsichtlich personeller und struktureller Ressourcen für die Behandlung penetrierender Verletzungen, wie sie im militärischen Kontext typisch sind. Eine Online-Umfrage wurde an Mitglieder der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie (DGAV) versendet (n = 411, davon 94,6 % in zivilen Krankenhäusern tätig). Erfragt wurden strukturelle Voraussetzungen zur Notfallversorgung sowie persönliche Erfahrungen mit penetrierenden Rumpfverletzungen. Es führten 34 % der Viszeralchirurgen im Notfall selbst Thorakotomien durch. Nur in 50 % der Kliniken steht ein Thoraxchirurg zur Verfügung, in 26 % ein Herzchirurg. Die Mehrheit der Befragten fühlt sich unzureichend auf die Versorgung penetrierender Verletzungen vorbereitet. Dabei unterscheiden sie klar zwischen zivilen (z. B. Schussverletzungen) und militärischen (z. B. Schrapnell, Explosivmunition) Verletzungsmustern. Angesichts einer sich verschärfenden Sicherheitslage sollte militärchirurgisches Basiswissen in die chirurgische Weiterbildung integriert und strukturell in Katastrophenschutz- und Notfallpläne eingebettet werden, um die Versorgungsfähigkeit in Ausnahmesituationen zu stärken."

    "title": "A rare case of abdominal gunshot trauma: Isolated common bile duct injury within the portal triad accompanied by liver and lung injury.",
    "abstract": "Injuries to the common bile duct (CBD) have been reported in 0.4-0.5% of penetrating trauma cases across several series. Gunshot wounds pose unique challenges due to the thermal injury caused by the projectile, combined with the close anatomical proximity of the CBD, portal vein, and hepatic artery within the hepatoduodenal ligament. This proximity often results in combined injuries to these vital structures, which are associated with high perioperative morbidity or mortality. Isolated injuries to the CBD within the hepatoduodenal ligament are exceptionally rare, given the structure's protective location and the interconnected nature of its compo-nents. The management of isolated CBD injuries remains a topic of ongoing debate. Here, we present a rare case of a gunshot wound causing an isolated CBD injury within the portal triad, accompanied by concomitant injuries to other intra-abdominal and thoracic organs.We present a 41-year-old male patient with an isolated CBD injury within the portal triad, accompanied by liver and lung injury sustained from a gunshot. Emergency computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a bullet trajectory of 14 cm extending from liver segment 6 to segment 4B, associated with laceration and contusion. Exploration revealed thermal damage to the gallbladder wall, and the integrity of the hepatoduodenal ligament was disrupted. A cholecystectomy was performed, and dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament revealed that approximately 70% of the CBD wall was transected. Importantly, the portal vein and hepatic artery remained intact. The proximal CBD was clamped, and complete transection of the duct was performed. Reconstruction involved a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy after preparing the jejunal segment. The patient experienced an uneventful recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 7 following drain removal. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no evidence of late complications.We believe that dissection of the hepatoduodenal ligament is necessary in patients with penetrating injuries near the hepatoduodenal ligament after hemostasis. Hepaticojejunostomy is an effective surgical treatment for patients with full-thickness transection of the CBD and reduces the risk of postoperative complications. Koledok kanalı yaralanmaları, penetran batın travması vakalarının %0.4-0.5’inde görülmektedir. Ateşli silah yaralanmaları, merminin neden olduğu termal hasarın yanı sıra, koledok kanalı, portal ven ve hepatik arterin hepatoduodenal ligaman içerisindeki yakın anatomik komşuluğu nedeniyle tüm yapılarda hasar meydana getirebilir. Bu yakınlık, genellikle bu hayati yapıların bir arada yaralanmasına yol açarak yüksek perioperatif morbidite veya mortalite ile ilişkilidir. Hepatoduodenal ligaman içerisindeki izole koledok kanalı yaralanmaları son derece nadirdir. İzole koledok kanalı yaralanmalarının yönetimi halen tartışmalı bir konudur. Olgu raporumuzda, karaciğer ve akciğer yaralanmasına eşlik eden hepatoduodenal ligamanın diğer bileşenlerine zarar vermeden portal triad içerisinde yalnızca koledok kanalının yaralandığı nadir bir ateşli silah yaralanması vakasını sunmaktayız. 41 yaşında, ateşli silah yaralanmasına bağlı koledok kanalı yaralanması nedeniyle acil servise başvuran erkek hastayı sunuyoruz. Acil serviste çekilen bilgisayarlı tomografi (BT) görüntülemesinde, karaciğerin 6. segmentinden 4B segmentine kadar uzanan 14 cm’lik bir mermi yolunu ve buna bağlı laserasyon ve kontüzyonu olduğu saptandı. Eksplorasyonda safra kesesi duvarında termal hasar tespit edildi ve hepatoduodenal ligamanın bütünlüğünün bozulmuş olduğu görüldü. Hastaya kolesistektomi uygulandı ve hepatoduodenal ligamanın diseksiyonu uygulanması ardından koledok duvarının yaklaşık %70 oranında açılmış olduğu tespit edildi. Portal ven ve hepatik arter salim izlendi. Proksimal koledok kanalı klemplendi ve tam transeksiyon uygulandı. Roux-en-Y hepatikojejunostomi ile rekonstrüksiyon uygulandı. Hasta postoperatif 7. günde taburcu edildi. Altı aylık takipte hastada komplikasyon saptanmadı. Hepatoduodenal ligaman yakınında penetran yaralanması olan hastalarda, hemostaz sağlandıktan sonra hepatoduodenal ligamanın diseksiyonunun gerekli olduğuna inanıyoruz. Tam kat koledok yaralanması olan hastalar için hepatikojejunostomi etkili bir cerrahi tedavi yöntemi olup, postoperatif komplikasyon riskini azaltmaktadır."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a rare but life-threatening condition in children, typically requiring urgent percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Despite its clinical importance, comprehensive data on paediatric cardiac tamponade are limited. We retrospectively reviewed 251 paediatric patients (0-18 years) with cardiac tamponade who underwent emergency percutaneous pericardiocentesis to evaluate the aetiological spectrum, age distribution, and associated clinical factors between November 2003 and May 2025. Diagnosis was based on echocardiographic criteria indicating haemodynamic compromise. Patients were categorised by age group, underlying aetiology, and recent history of cardiac intervention. Structural heart diseases were the leading cause of cardiac tamponade (51.6%), particularly in neonates and infants. Pericardiocentesis was most frequently performed in children aged 6-12 years (28.2%). Cardiomyopathies were more prevalent in older age groups. Infectious causes were the second most common aetiology (11.5%). Cardiac Tamponade occurred more frequently following cardiac surgery (12.3%) than after catheter-based interventions. Iatrogenic tamponade was identified in six patients, most commonly during high-risk transcatheter procedures. Genetic syndromes were present in 30 patients, with Down syndrome being the most common. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest single-centre cohort of paediatric cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis. Cardiac causes, particularly structural heart diseases, represent the most common aetiology across all age groups; therefore, these patients should be promptly evaluated for cardiac tamponade when presenting with relevant symptoms."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a rare, potentially fatal complication of deep vein thrombosis characterized by sudden limb swelling, pain, and cyanosis. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism is estimated to be 1.5 to 3.5 times higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in the general population. Without prompt treatment, it may progress to venous gangrene, compartment syndrome, or circulatory shock. Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder, increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to persistent inflammation and hypercoagulability, which can precipitate phlegmasia cerulea dolens. CASE REPORT A 26-year-old male smoker with a history of fistulizing Crohn's disease, nonadherence to his prescribed regimen, chronic pulmonary embolism, and prior inferior vena cava filter placement presented with acute right lower limb swelling and pain. Doppler ultrasonography revealed extensive iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis extending into the inferior vena cava; clinical evaluation confirmed compartment syndrome. Emergency fasciotomy and popliteal artery embolectomy restored circulation and prevented ischemic injury. Subsequently, the patient required a blood transfusion due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding, followed by an emergent exploratory laparotomy with right hemicolectomy, ileocecal resection, and ileostomy after colonoscopy failed to identify an active bleeding source. The patient recovered well postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the importance of early recognition and prompt management of phlegmasia cerulea dolens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly among younger individuals with an increased risk of thrombotic complications."

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading preventable cause of early death after trauma. The Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) examination is widely used to detect free intraperitoneal fluid, but its prognostic value for hemorrhage grading and trauma severity classification requires synthesis. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched through March 2025 for human studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic utility of FAST in blunt or penetrating trauma. Studies were selected based on the population (or patient/problem), intervention, comparison (or control), and outcome (PICO) framework, excluding case reports, editorials, conference abstracts, animal studies, and those without extractable outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies, Version 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Seven studies, including approximately 7,310 patients, met the inclusion criteria. FAST demonstrated high specificity up to 97% for detecting clinically significant hemoperitoneum. Positive findings were associated with increased transfusion requirements, greater need for surgery or embolization, higher intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, elevated injury severity, and higher short-term mortality. Semi-quantitative interpretations, such as the number and distribution of positive zones, enhanced hemorrhage stratification. Combining FAST with physiological parameters in validated trauma scoring systems improved the prediction of massive transfusion and operative urgency. Despite operator dependence and limited sensitivity for small or retroperitoneal bleeds, standardized protocols and serial assessments can strengthen its role in early trauma decision-making."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade in patients with bacterial pericarditis has a high mortality rate. A timely diagnosis is crucial and can only be achieved through repeated systematic clinical evaluation, the use of POCUS and awareness of cognitive biases in clinical reasoning. A 56-year-old male was admitted to the emergency room with shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient became haemodynamically unstable and was treated for a septic shock. A POCUS showed signs of a cardiac tamponade, but these were not acknowledged as such. The diagnosis was delayed until the patient had a circulatory arrest. He was successfully resuscitated, and a pericardiocentesis showed a haemophilus influenzae pericarditis. The patient recovered well after pericardiocentesis and treatment with antibiotics. For unstable patients, it is essential to conduct systematic assessments at regular intervals and whenever there is a change in clinical status. Cardiac and lung POCUS have proved to be useful in undifferentiated shock patients. Importantly, pericardial effusion should always be ruled out. For every clinician, it is important to be aware of possible cognitive biases in clinical reasoning and to use strategies to mitigate these risks. The central venous pressure should be assessed in all shock patients before and after fluid resuscitation.POCUS should be performed on all patients in shock to evaluate central venous filling and rule out pericardial effusion.If any significant pericardial fluid is found, tamponade should be considered as a contributing cause of hypoperfusion.Pericardial fluid removal rapidly improves haemodynamic status; the patient will not recover unless this is done.Awareness of cognitive biases in clinical reasoning, and strategies to mitigate them, are essential because such biases can contribute to medical errors."

    "abstract": "Complications occur in approximately 12% of cases of diverticulitis, with perforation occurring in up to 10% of complications. Typically, patient with perforated diverticulitis present intraperitoneally with abdominal pain and peritoneal signs. By contrast, pneumoretroperitoneum and pneumomediastinum are rare complications and lack typical symptoms, making their diagnosis difficult and often delayed, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. A 66-year-old man presented with lower abdominal pain for 3 days. On examination, his vital signs were stable, and the abdomen was soft with mild distension and left lower quadrant tenderness, but no peritoneal signs were noted. Laboratory tests indicated leukocytosis and a markedly elevated C-reactive protein level. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed focal wall thickening and fat stranding near the rectosigmoid junction as well as pneumoretroperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, and minor pneumoperitoneum. Suspecting hollow organ perforation, an emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed which revealed a retroperitoneal abscess with mesocolonic necrosis, likely due to perforated sigmoid diverticulitis. The patient underwent sigmoid resection with Hartmann's procedure and retroperitoneal drainage. Follow-up CT on postoperative day 14 confirmed resolution of the free air, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 40 with an uneventful recovery. Pneumoretroperitoneum and pneumomediastinum are rare complications of perforated diverticulitis, often with delayed diagnosis due to the absence of peritoneal signs. CT aids detection, and timely surgical intervention is crucial."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal perforation is a very common surgical emergency with significant mortality and morbidity, which needs urgent intervention. Foreign body-related perforations are very rare, accounting for less than 1% of cases. However, Colonic perforation by Eel fish is an extremely rare phenomenon; only three cases have been reported in the existing literature. Here, we report a rare case of traumatic colonic perforation with septic shock by a rectally inserted Eel fish. A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of abdominal pain, accompanied by high-grade fever and a loss of consciousness lasting 1 day. Initial workups suggested the case might be a case of intestinal perforation with septic shock. However, in the abdominal X-ray, there was a bizarre radiopaque shadow in the right iliac fossa. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was done, and a large perforation was found at the rectosigmoid junction. Multiple pieces of fish bone were found in the peritoneal cavity. A putrefied Eel fish was found in the peritoneal cavity, approximately 25 cm in length. After thorough peritoneal toileting, a Hartmann-like procedure, where the distal end was closed and secured with a silk suture and the proximal exteriorized for fecal diversion, was done, and the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. However, despite the best medical care, the patient expired on the third postoperative day. Live animals causing rectal perforation have rarely been documented in the literature. Unusual healthcare beliefs, inadvertent sexual conduct, or criminal aggressiveness may be involved. However, the cause may remain a mystery. Rapid diagnosis with proper history, aided by imaging, with urgent surgical intervention, may increase patient survival. Therefore, emergency care physicians should also be conscious of the rare and unusual causes of intestinal perforation to reach the diagnosis promptly."

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic injuries are uncommon but are associated with high mortality rates in acute and chronic presentations. Mortality increases with complications of diaphragmatic hernia, which include strangulated bowel, perforation, and peritonitis. Traumatic diaphragmatic injury (TDI) is notoriously underdiagnosed and delayed presentations are common. Firearm injuries and stab wounds account for the majority of TDI. Blunt TDI is frequently associated with severe injuries including pneumothorax and hemorrhaging shock. Contrast enhanced computed tomography imaging is the gold standard for diagnosis in both blunt and penetrating mechanisms of injury. Laparoscopy is a useful nonoperative tool for diagnosing TDI. Small lacerations may not warrant further investigation or repair at the index admission. Patients with clinical instability and/or evidence of TDI with blunt trauma warrant emergent operative intervention. Recognition of TDI is essential for nurse practitioners and physician assistants, given disease mortality, frequency of delayed presentations, and the lack of guidance on surveillance for initially nonoperative injuries."

    "title": "Prospective Randomised Control Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Hypochlorous Acid as a Peritoneal Lavage Agent to Prevent Surgical Site Infection After Exploratory Laparotomy for Perforation Peritonitis.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major concern following emergency gastrointestinal procedures, particularly exploratory laparotomy for perforation peritonitis, where infection risk is amplified by the inherent contamination of the operative field. Despite prophylactic antibiotics, the microbial burden frequently surpasses host defence thresholds. Intraoperative peritoneal lavage with antimicrobial agents such as hypochlorous acid (HOCl) has emerged as a promising strategy, combining physical removal of contaminants with direct microbicidal action. Methods This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial and 148 patients were included in the study who presented with peritonitis secondary to gastrointestinal perforation. Participants were randomly assigned to receive intraoperative lavage using either HOCl (Group A) or normal saline (Group B). The primary endpoint was the rate of SSIs within 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included early wound progression, postoperative fever, and rates of wound healing by postoperative days 15 and 30. Additional variables such as patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical parameters, and anatomical factors were evaluated. Results The HOCl group demonstrated a marked reduction in SSI incidence (20.3%) compared to the saline group (39.2%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 19%. Early postoperative indicators - wound severity escalation and fever by day 3 - were predictive of subsequent SSI. No statistically significant associations were found between infection rates and patient-related or operative variables. By day 15, 79% of patients in the HOCl group showed complete wound healing, significantly outperforming the saline group (50%, p<0.001). All HOCl-treated wounds achieved complete healing by day 30. No adverse reactions or resistant organisms were identified among HOCl intraperitoneal lavage recipients. Conclusion Intraperitoneal hypochlorous acid lavage has a significant role in reducing the rate of SSI in perforation peritonitis cases."

    "abstract": "Understanding a patient's medical history and comorbidities before arrival at a hospital can help select the appropriate medical institution for transport and may be related to outcomes by assisting with treatment after arrival at the hospital. This study aimed to clarify the comorbidities associated with blunt trauma outcomes. Using the Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB), a nationwide large dataset in Japan, we studied 119,929 cases of blunt trauma among patients admitted to JTDB-participating hospitals from January 2019 to December 2022, excluding those with cardiac arrest before hospital arrival. We compared the groups according to the severity of the trauma, age, sex, and each item of the original Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) at the time of discharge and then used Cox regression analysis, a multivariate analysis, to explore the relationship between the outcome and each item of the CCI. There were significant differences in 10 of the 19 CCI items between the mortality and survival groups. However, Cox regression analysis, including the bootstrap method, was narrowed down to seven items, and the comorbidities that were significantly associated with mortality were leukemia, moderate or severe liver disease, metastatic malignant neoplasm, moderate renal disease, congestive heart failure, collagen disease, and chronic pulmonary disease in that order. Comorbidities that can affect the prognosis of blunt trauma were identified from the items in the original CCI. It is beneficial for emergency medical personnel to know about pre-existing comorbidities associated with the prognosis of blunt trauma cases when selecting a transport facility before arrival at the hospital, and the condition of trauma cases with pre-existing or dysfunctional major organs, such as the liver, kidneys, heart, and lungs, should not be underestimated."

A 17-year-old patient with no history of sexual activity and under chronic antipsychotic medication presented to the emergency department with signs of acute surgical abdomen and fever up to 37.9°C. Laboratory markers of inflammation were elevated. An emergency computed tomography scan revealed a large, solid echogenic pelvic mass of unclear origin. The clinical and laboratory findings, along with the imaging results, led to the decision to perform an emergency exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, a large, solid ovarian mass in torsion, along with the ipsilateral fallopian tube, was identified. A right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a torsed ovarian fibroma. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. This article also includes a brief narrative review of the literature regarding ovarian fibromas with torsion, focusing on their rarity, diagnostic challenges, management, and prognosis."

While this commonly affects the colon, in rare cases, chronic diverticulitis can lead to scarring and fibrosis that impact the small bowel. This case report describes the clinical course of a 56-year-old male with multiple comorbidities who presented to the emergency department for acute abdominal pain with worsening abdominal distention. Imaging revealed extensive intraperitoneal free air, and he was emergently taken for an exploratory laparotomy. Surgery revealed feculent peritonitis, multiple bowel perforations, and a closed-loop small bowel obstruction between the tethered area of pelvic adhesions and a large bowel obstruction extending from the ileocecal valve to the stricture in the distal large bowel. This report highlights the uncommon presentation of simultaneous small and large bowel obstructions originating from related but distinct mechanisms, and emphasizes the importance of understanding how chronic diverticulitis can lead to significant and life-threatening complications. It emphasizes the need to identify causes of bowel ischemia and illustrates the critical role of a multidisciplinary team in managing complex postoperative complications and maintaining nutritional status in patients with significant comorbidities."

    "abstract": "Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a stress-induced cardiomyopathy that causes transient left ventricular dysfunction. Although generally considered benign, TTS occasionally leads to serious complications such as cardiac rupture or left ventricular thrombus, both of which carry significant risks. A 69-year-old woman presented to our hospital with dyspnoea after physical and emotional stress. Based on the findings of ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram and wall motion abnormality of the left ventricular apex on echocardiography, an acute coronary syndrome was suspected. Emergency coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis in the coronary artery, but left ventriculography showed typical apical ballooning, consistent with TTS. Anticoagulation with heparin was initiated to prevent left ventricular thrombus formation. On the fifth day after admission, echocardiography revealed a left ventricular apical thrombus and slight pericardial effusion, which developed into cardiac tamponade on day 6. While being prepared for emergency surgery, the patient was diagnosed with cardiac rupture and went into cardiac arrest. Therefore, venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was initiated prior to the surgical procedure. Successful repair of the ruptured free wall site in the left ventricular anterolateral region resulted in complete recovery. The patient was discharged on day 35. To our knowledge, this is the first case of TTS complicated by cardiac rupture during anticoagulation treatment for a left ventricular thrombus. Although anticoagulation therapy may have precipitated the bleeding associated with cardiac rupture, the early diagnosis of TTS complications and prompt management, including emergency surgery, may have contributed to the patient's favourable outcome."

    "abstract": "Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) remains one of the most formidable challenges in acute care, with global survival rates persistently below 7.5% despite significant advances in trauma systems and resuscitative strategies. Through a comprehensive scoping review of literature from 2016 to 2025, this study delineates the shifting epidemiology, modern management, and key determinants of outcomes in TCA. Our synthesis reveals that TCA predominantly affects young males and results primarily from blunt mechanisms, with severe hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury as leading critical lesions. While pioneering interventions such as resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta and emergency resuscitative thoracotomy have been widely adopted, robust evidence for their survival benefit remains limited and context dependent. Early identification and correction of reversible causes, targeted hemorrhage control, and timely application of advanced life support measures-especially prehospital thoracostomy and vascular access-significantly increase the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurological outcomes. Conversely, routine use of epinephrine shows at best inconsistent benefits and may be detrimental in blunt trauma. Survival is further influenced by initial rhythm, presence of signs of life, rapid patient triage to trauma centers, and tailored protocols for pediatric and older populations. Notwithstanding notable progress, major knowledge gaps persist in defining optimal intervention timing, reporting standards, and long-term neurologic recovery. The findings underscore the critical need for multicenter, prospective research, harmonized trauma registries, and global consensus to inform future guidelines and optimize outcomes for TCA patients."

    "abstract": "Although rare, athletic head and cervical spine injuries can be devastating. All health care professionals involved in the on-field care of athletes with these injuries should be aware of updated national guidelines as well as individual institutional practices regarding head and neck immobilization after on-field injuries. Appropriate prehospital management-including evaluation, equipment removal, spine board immobilization, and patient transfer-can mitigate further risk for these injured athletes. The goal of spinal-motion restriction is to reduce spinal instability and prevent further neurologic injury. Indications include blunt trauma with altered level of consciousness, cervical spinal pain or tenderness, or concern for spinal instability, loss of cervical motion, bilateral neurologic complaints, or anatomic deformity of the spine after a sports-related injury. This video will describe critical aspects of on-field management of head and neck injuries, featuring a video demonstration of current care concepts and recommended best practices for spinal motion restriction, removal of athletic equipment, and patient transfer techniques for on-field spine boarding. The video demonstrates removal of the helmet and shoulder pads, as well as transfer techniques for athletes in the supine or prone position. The videos also highlight appropriate communication throughout the transfer process, which is paramount to successful stabilization. Preinjury preparedness allows health care providers to optimize on-field emergency care safely and efficiently. The appropriate method of spinal-motion restriction is dictated by the athlete's clinical examination, position on the playing field, body position (eg, supine, side-lying, or prone), and the number of rescuers available. Stabilization using more rescuers (≥6) has been shown to minimize spinal motion across an unstable spine injury. Return to sport is managed on a case-by-case basis, determined by the type and the severity of the injury sustained, and by the necessary interventions performed upon transfer to a higher center of care. Optimizing on-field management of athletic cervical spine injuries with thorough communication and collaborative stabilization techniques can help mitigate the risk of further neurologic compromise in the injured athlete. Understanding various techniques for immobilization, equipment management, and patient transfer will enable health care professionals to provide safe and reproducible care for these injured athletes.

We report the case of a 17-year-old male who sustained a right atrial appendage rupture with pericardial tamponade after a high-speed auto-versus-pedestrian collision. There was no evidence of chest injury, including rib fractures, upon presentation. The initial assessment revealed hemodynamic instability and a positive Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam in the right upper quadrant, with equivocal pericardial space findings, prompting emergent exploratory laparotomy and pericardial window. Upon decompression of a significant pericardial effusion, cardiothoracic surgery identified and repaired a 2 cm defect of the right atrial appendage via emergent median sternotomy. The patient recovered well following surgical intervention and was discharged home on hospital day 12. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of blunt cardiac injury in the absence of apparent external chest trauma. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for occult cardiac injury in patients with unexplained hypotension following high-energy mechanisms, even when chest imaging and exam findings are discordant. Early surgical intervention remains critical for survival in these rare but potentially survivable injuries."

We report a 92-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice and complete distal common bile duct obstruction, in whom standard ERCP failed. A percutaneous-endoscopic rendezvous (PE-RV) approach successfully established biliary drainage via a transhepatic guidewire and stent placement. However, the patient developed pneumoperitoneum, tension pneumothorax, and subcutaneous emphysema following abrupt catheter removal. These manifestations are collectively referred to as \"air leak syndrome,\" which encompasses the abnormal presence of air in the peritoneal cavity, pleural space, and subcutaneous tissue. Imaging showed no pneumoretroperitoneum, suggesting gas migration through an immature percutaneous tract. Urgent drainage and antibiotics led to gradual recovery. This case highlights PE-RV as a valuable salvage technique but underscores the risk of rare gas-related complications when percutaneous tract closure is premature. To minimize the risk of such complications, procedural protocols may need to incorporate delayed catheter removal or tract embolization to ensure safe outcomes.

Both single- or multivessel endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting procedures were analysed. Patients were excluded if they underwent a redo-operation, coronary unroofing procedure, or conversion to sternotomy. A total of 476 patients were included in the final analysis: 246 patients in the conventional drain removal protocol and 230 patients in the early drain removal protocol. Patients in the early drain removal group had significantly higher rates of preexisting comorbidities, preoperative antithrombotic therapy, and urgent procedures (52.6% vs. 36.2%, p < 0.001). The total drain time (5.1 vs. 22.4 h, p < 0.001) and the total drain volume (135 vs. 310 mL, p < 0.001) were both significantly lower in the early postoperative drain removal protocol.

After accepting blood transfusion, the hemoglobin level still decreased. On POD6, we performed an exploratory laparotomy and found a rupture in the right lobe of the liver, followed by liver rupture repair packing and cesarean section. But the patient still had obviours abdominal drainage. At night, the interventional radiologist performed an emergency liver arteriography, which revealed bleeding from the right hepatic artery branch, and interventional embolization was performed. Finally, the hemodynamics became stable. The patient was discharged 2 weeks later. Three months after surgery, an enhanced CT scan indicated that the liver had basically returned to normal. Infection can lead to liver rupture in pregnancy without high blood pressure. Appropriate targeted antibiotic therapy is essential and should be accompanied by prompt surgical or endovascular treatment to improve maternal and fetal outcomes."

    "abstract": "A 33-year-old woman at 37 weeks of gestation presented with progressive dyspnea and cough, initially misdiagnosed as pneumonia. Imaging revealed a large (>15 cm) anterior mediastinal mass compressing the pulmonary arteries and bronchi, along with a significant pericardial effusion. Echocardiography confirmed tamponade physiology. Given the high risk of cardiovascular collapse during labor, a multidisciplinary team, including obstetrics, cardiology, anesthesia, and cardiothoracic surgery, proceeded with emergent cesarean delivery under general anesthesia, followed by subxiphoid pericardial window and excisional biopsy. Postoperative recovery occurred in the intensive care unit, and both the mother and infant remained stable. Pathology confirmed primary mediastinal high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and the patient was promptly started on systemic chemotherapy with DA-REPOCH (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (hydroxydaunorubicin), and rituximab). This case underscores the importance of early recognition, rapid multidisciplinary coordination, and integrated oncologic planning in the management of life-threatening cardiothoracic pathology during pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Cesarean delivery has become one of the most frequent interventions in obstetrics, and abnormal fetal presentation continues to be a major indication. External cephalic version (ECV) is commonly used to reduce the need for cesarean delivery, but when performed in uncontrolled settings, it may lead to serious complications. We report the case of a 39-year-old grand multipara (G11P11) referred from a rural community after undergoing an emperic ECV attempted by a traditional birth attendant eight days before admission. She developed premature rupture of membranes with persistent leakage for one week, followed by severe abdominal pain, intrauterine fetal demise at 34 weeks, sepsis, and severe anemia. Ultrasound revealed oligohydramnios and fetal death. An urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed with antibiotic coverage and transfusion. Intraoperatively, a complete uterine rupture with retroperitoneal extension was identified, with the intact amniotic sac containing the fetus free in the left iliac fossa and the placenta completely separated within the abdominal cavity. Emergency hysterectomy with left oophorectomy, serosal bowel repair, bilateral uterine artery ligation, and extensive abdominal lavage was undertaken. The patient recovered favorably with intensive postoperative care and was discharged on day eight. This case emphasizes that uterine rupture can occur even in women without previous uterine surgery, particularly in the context of extreme multiparity and non-medical obstetric practices. It highlights the importance of performing ECV exclusively in hospital settings, ensuring timely referral, and strengthening community education to prevent catastrophic maternal outcomes."

    "title": "Post-operative Infections After Emergent Laparotomy for Traumatic Perforated Viscera: An Assessment of Risk Factors and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Trauma involving perforated viscera is at high risk for surgical site infection (SSI). Standard practice is to give peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics within one hour before surgery. There is still uncertainty regarding the best specific agents and how trauma-related variables interact with prophylactic antibiotics. Methods This retrospective cohort study assessed patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy due to traumatic hollow visceral perforation between 1/1/2020 and 12/31/2023. The primary objective was to assess risk factors for post-operative infections. Other outcomes were death, hospital and ventilator days, and intensive care unit treatment. Significance testing for categorical and continuous data was performed with the chi-squared test and t-test, respectively. Multivariate analysis for binary and continuous outcomes was performed with logistic and linear regression, respectively. Results Two hundred thirty-one patients were included. SSI occurred in 26 (11%) with superficial, deep, and organ space infections documented in six, six, and 14 patients, respectively. Ertapenem was the most common antimicrobial prophylaxis (168, 73%). Antimicrobial prophylaxis without expected activity against anaerobes was given in 46 patients (20%). No antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered in 10 patients (4%). Antimicrobials were administered within 60 minutes prior to the procedure in 150 patients (65%). Patients who received peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis with any agent had six SSIs (2.9%) versus four SSIs (15.4%) for patients who received no antibiotic prophylaxis of any kind (p=0.017). Patients who received ertapenem prophylaxis had one trauma-related SSI (0.6%) versus four SSIs (6.2%) for patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis with any other agent (p=0.008). On multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio for infection associated with ertapenem prophylaxis versus any other agent was protective at 0.05 (p=0.01). Hospital length of stay (LOS) was 20.3 days for patients who received post-operative antibiotics versus 12.1 days for those who did not receive post-operative antibiotics (p<0.01). Patients who received massive transfusion protocol (MTP) had eight SSIs (22.2%) versus 17 SSIs (8.8%) for those who did not receive MTP (p=0.02). Patients who received post-operative vasopressors had nine SSIs (22%) versus 17 SSIs (9%) for those who did not receive post-operative vasopressors (p=0.02). Patients whose abdominal fascia was left open at the end of the index operation had 21 SSIs (16.4%) versus five SSIs (4.9%) for those whose fascia was closed immediately (p=0.01).  Conclusion Lack of antibiotic prophylaxis, MTP, post-operative vasopressors, and open abdomen predict SSI. Ertapenem was associated with a lower traumatic wound infection rate, but not SSI. Other specific antibiotic agents and timing intervals were not significant. Variables that are surrogates for trauma severity are more accurate predictors of SSI than specific antibiotic agents and timing."

The inability to recognize a complication can delay meeting the 5-minute metric. To improve nurses' recognition of cardiac tamponade and awareness of equipment needed for resternotomy and to decrease response time from start of cardiac arrest to resternotomy. In coordination with key stakeholders, the nursing professional development specialist created a 4-hour multimodal education program that included classroom engagement, deliberate practice, and a high-fidelity simulation with detailed prebriefing and debriefing. In 2023 the course was increased to 8 hours to allow for a repeat of the simulation. A total of 444 nurses participated. The mean (SD) setup time in preparation for sternotomy in 2021 was 311.2 (101.7) seconds, or 5.2 minutes; in 2022 was 323.8 (183.7) seconds, or 5.4 minutes; and in 2023 (after the repeated simulation was added to the course) was 254.8 (170.4) seconds, or 4.2 minutes, which was less than the 5-minute metric. After attending the course, nurses' response time during simulation of an open chest emergency improved."

Organ referral occurred in 79 ​%, yet only 1 ​% became donors(13 organs), all from blunt injury largely without SOL. Blood-product utilization was highest in penetrating thoracic and blunt with SOL. Surveys showed low support of EDT for teaching or blunt trauma without SOL, though nearly half supported for donation. Occupational exposure occurred in 17 ​%, with 50 ​% requiring prophylaxis.

    "abstract": "Spontaneous rupture of the spleen during pregnancy or after delivery is an extremely rare, potentially life-threatening complication that poses major diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. A 33-year-old woman at 27 weeks of gestation presented with a 1-week history of polyhydramnios and progressive abdominal distension. She had no history of trauma and recognized risk factors. On presentation, abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated large-volume ascites, which was not evident on the initial non-contrast whole-abdominal CT performed because of maternal instability. The patient showed a progressive decline in hemoglobin and abnormal fetal umbilical artery flow. After multidisciplinary consultation involving surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, radiology/ultrasound, and neonatology, an emergency cesarean delivery with exploratory laparotomy was undertaken. Intraoperative exploration revealed active hemorrhage originating near the splenic hilum with a ruptured splenic capsule and omental adhesions. A total splenectomy was performed after family consent after discussion with the team, and postoperative paraffin-embedded tissue confirmed spontaneous splenic rupture. However, this was a rare case. We hypothesize that marked polyhydramnios with increased intra-abdominal pressure and traction of omental adhesions contributed to splenic capsular rupture, intraperitoneal hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic shock. This case emphasizes the importance of close monitoring of amniotic fluid volume and prompt evaluation of acute abdominal pain in pregnancy, particularly in patients with polyhydramnios. Our review of published literature highlights that spontaneous splenic rupture, although rare, can occur during the antenatal period and is frequently associated with delayed diagnosis and poor outcomes. Early recognition and timely surgical intervention remain essential for improving maternal and fetal survival."

    "abstract": "Isolated hepatic tuberculosis is a rare clinical entity, particularly in immunocompetent patients. It is characterized by frequently silent symptoms and nonspecific radiological abnormalities, which complicates its diagnosis in the absence of specific clinical guidance. We present the case of a 39-year-old man with no significant medical history who was admitted to the emergency department with acute peritonitis resulting from gastric perforation. An exploratory laparotomy confirmed the prepyloric perforation and incidentally revealed the presence of two subcapsular hepatic nodules located in segment II. Histopathological analysis of liver biopsies revealed the presence of epithelioid and giant cell granulomatous inflammation, accompanied by caseous necrosis, strongly suggestive of hepatic tuberculosis. The staging assessment, which included a chest CT scan (showing no pulmonary lesions or mediastinal lymphadenopathy), and abdominal imaging, proved negative, reinforcing the diagnosis of isolated hepatic tuberculosis.The patient was placed on standard anti-tuberculosis treatment, with positive clinical results. This case highlights the importance of considering hepatic tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of hepatic nodular lesions, even in immunocompetent patients, particularly in endemic areas. It also highlights the crucial importance of histopathological analysis in the diagnostic process and in the rapid adjustment of therapeutic management."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous uterine rupture in a non-gravid, unscarred uterus is an exceedingly rare and life-threatening gynecological emergency. This report details a unique case of such a rupture in a postmenopausal woman, secondary to a fulminant pelvic infection. A 55-year-old grand multipara postmenopausal woman, with a history of recurrent lower abdominal pain, presented with severe abdominal pain, malodorous vaginal discharge, and fever of six days duration. Physical examination revealed a diffusely tender abdomen with guarding, and laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis and anemia. Abdominal ultrasound revealed intra-abdominal collection with an echo complex mass in the paracolic gutter, suggestive of abscess collection in the abdominoplevic cavity. Due to hemodynamic instability, the patient was resuscitated with crystalloids and underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy involving both surgical and gynecologic teams. Intraoperatively, about 2000 ml of purulent material was sucked out, and the uterine fundus was found ruptured, necrotic, and eaten up for which a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done. Microbiological analysis confirmed Escherichia coli infection, and histopathology ruled out malignancy, showing only inflammatory changes. A spontaneous uterine rupture in a non-gravid, unscarred uterus resulted from fulminant pelvic infection, establishing chronic pelvic inflammatory disease as an etiology through direct tissue erosion. This case underscores the necessity of considering genital tract sepsis in postmenopausal women presenting with acute abdomen and highlights the critical importance of emergent surgical intervention, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and rigorous adherence to PID management guidelines for preventing this life-threatening complication."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a rare but serious complication of myocardial infarction, most often occurring in cases of complete myocardial rupture. Atypical forms, such as oozing-type rupture, without macroscopic rupture, can also cause a tamponade. We report an exceptional case of hemorrhagic tamponade due to subacute myocardial infarction without obvious myocardial rupture, occurring in a patient with no known medical history. We report a case of a 70-year-old man who was found in shock on a public street after several weeks of atypical chest pain. On admission, he presented with cardiogenic shock and signs of peripheral hypoperfusion, severe hypotension, and tachycardia. Emergency echocardiography revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion associated with global left ventricular hypokinesia. Biomarkers showed severe myocardial injury. CT angiography, performed before drainage to exclude aortic dissection requiring emergency surgery, confirmed the hemorrhagic effusion without dissection. While pericardial drainage was planned, the patient experienced refractory cardiac arrest. Salvage thoracotomy revealed a hemorrhagic effusion without macroscopic myocardial rupture. Post-infarction hemorrhagic tamponade may result from complete myocardial rupture (blowout) or from an \"oozing\" form, related to micro-tears or epicardial vascular fragility. In the present case, the rapid progression to terminal shock contrasts with previously reported cases in the literature, which were generally more subacute. Echocardiography provided an immediate diagnostic orientation, demonstrating its crucial role in managing shock. This case illustrates a rare but lethal complication of subacute myocardial infarction, i.e., hemorrhagic tamponade without complete myocardial rupture. It shows the importance of early tamponade diagnosis, the important contribution of emergency echocardiography, and the severity of silent-evolving infarctions in the context of unrecognized atherosclerotic disease."

This study assessed the predictors of morbidity and mortality among elderly patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy at Jinja, Lira, Hoima, and Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospitals. This was a prospective observational cohort in which elderly patients (≥ 65 years) that underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy from 15th November 2024 to 14th February 2025 were enrolled and followed up until 30 days post-operatively to assess for the occurrence morbidity and mortality. The complications assessed included hemorrhage, surgical site infection, deep venous thrombosis, respiratory complications. SPSS version 26 was used for analysis, with Poisson regression done to determine the significant predictors. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Of the 86 participants, 29.1% were above 80 years of age. Majority were male (74.4%). Complications were seen in 25.6% of the participants. The commonest complication was surgical site infection. Mortality occurred in 10.5%. In the multivariable analysis, being older than 80 years, having DM or hypertension and having a perforation were associated with complications; delayed presentation to hospital and blood transfusion associated with mortality (P < 0.05 for all). The rates of morbidity were high. More attention is required among the elderly undergoing surgery in order to reduce the rate at which they get morbidity and mortality with emphasis on wound care. Health education and sensitization in communities should be strengthened, advocating for timely seeking of medical attention by the elderly group."

    "abstract": "The transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) concentrates represents an emerging approach in paediatric trauma management, even in the prehospital period. Nevertheless, distinctive parameters for predicting the need for transfusion in children are still lacking. This study aimed to identify indicators for early in-hospital RBC transfusions that are primarily accessible either in the prehospital or in the early in-hospital setting in a large paediatric trauma cohort. This study comprised a retrospective analysis of the German TraumaRegister DGU®. It included children and adolescents aged 1 to 16 years from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland over a 15-year period. Contingency tables were used to identify risk factors, which were then assessed through multivariate regression analysis. The model's predictive capacity was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A total of 11,849 patients were included, with RBC transfusion performed in 5.9% of cases. Polytraumatised patients (adjusted odds ratio (adj. OR) 4.18 [95% confidence interval 3.26-5.34]) and those with penetrating injuries (adj. OR 4.32 [2.96-6.30]) and abdominal injuries (adj. OR 4.18 [3.34-5.24]) exhibited the highest risk of requiring an RBC transfusion. The need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (adj. OR 2.46 [1.84-3.28]), endotracheal intubation (adj. OR 2.51 [1.93-3.28]), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8 (adj. OR 2.49 [1.85-3.36]) were also significant, but weaker, predictors. A model based on the mentioned parameters achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.87 [0.85-0.88], whereas predictive performance was lower but still acceptable when only parameters available in the prehospital setting were included (AUC 0.80 [0.78-0.82]). The likelihood of requiring an RBC transfusion is increased in cases of polytrauma, abdominal and penetrating trauma, patients with a GCS ≤ 8, and those requiring tracheal intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Therefore, the proposed risk factors can help identify patients at risk of severe haemorrhage and subsequent transfusion requirement. Not applicable."

The Animal Trauma Triage (ATT) score and modified Glasgow Coma Scale (mGCS) are used to assess illness severity, but their clinical utility in veterinary patients remains undervalued. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of ATT and mGCS scores and their association with organ dysfunction and survival in polytraumatized veterinary patients. We hypothesized that multi-organ failure (MOF) is more prevalent in non-survivors and correlates with higher ATT and lower mGCS scores. A prospective observational study was conducted for 30 patients (20 dogs and 10 cats) admitted to two veterinary hospitals. Clinical data, trauma scores, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. The overall survival rate was 83.3%; blunt trauma accounted for 80% of cases. Non-survivors (n = 5) had higher respiratory rates at admission (p = 0.01). The ATT score accurately predicted all fatalities, while the mGCS score showed limited prognostic value. MOF was the leading cause of death in 60% of non-survivors. ATT appears to be a more reliable tool for outcome prediction, enabling improved triage, resource allocation, and early intervention in veterinary trauma cases."

    "abstract": "Occupational eye injuries (OEIs) remain a major public health issue despite regulatory efforts toward increasing protective eyewear use. OEIs encompass a wide spectrum of trauma, from superficial injury to tissue melt and globe rupture. These injuries are associated with substantial medical, economic, and social burden. This narrative review identifies risk factors associated with OEIs, differences based on workplace, and barriers to OEI prevention. Risks for OEI include male sex, low educational attainment, low income, or being a temporary or migrant worker. Certain industries such as metalworking, construction and manufacturing, chemical handling, and agriculture, also carry unique ocular hazards that predispose workers to OEIs. Although many OEIs are minor, those that cause severe injury can result in permanent visual loss and blindness. Industrial and construction workers are frequently exposed to high-velocity foreign bodies (FBs) and blunt trauma, while agricultural workers are at elevated risk for open globe injuries, FBs and the vision-threatening sequalae of infection from organic material. Chemical injuries, although less common, are notable for high rates of bilateral eye involvement, often requiring urgent intervention. Unfortunately, most OEIs occur in the absence of proper protective eyewear. Barriers range from discomfort and poor fit, inadequate access, and lack of perceived need, all of which contribute to low compliance in various occupational settings. Current evaluations of behavioral and regulatory interventions to increase adherence show promise but with mixed results. Advances in protective eyewear technology that optimize comfort and usage tracking may be helpful for employers to ensure compliance. A comprehensive understanding of OEI mechanisms and the obstacles to increased protective eyewear use is critical to mitigate the impact of OEIs on workers."

Epidemiological data from Germany, Austria and Switzerland are lacking. The objective of this study was therefore to collect data on the use of REBOA intervention and the characteristics of the affected patient population. A retrospective analysis of the TraumaRegister DGU® between January 2020 and December 2022 was conducted to evaluate the frequency of REBOA interventions, injury patterns, injury severity, epidemiology and additional therapies received by patients treated with REBOA. Between 2020 and 2022, 95,510 patients were documented in Germany, Austria and Switzerland (DACH), of whom 62 received REBOA. 44 of 62 patients (71%) were under 60 years of age and 57 (92%) suffered a blunt trauma. Severe injury (AIS ≥ 3) was present in the following regions: head 36%, thorax 77%, abdomen 58%, extremities 65%. 23 of 59 patients (39%) did not have a systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg. Of the 62 patients, 42 (68%) received at least one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC), and 24 (39%) received ≥ 10 PRBCs within the first 48 h. Thoracotomy was performed in nine patients (15%), laparotomy in 24 (39%), and 15 (23%) underwent surgical pelvic stabilisation. The expected mortality according to the RISC II score was 43%, while the observed mortality was 45%. Fourteen REBOAs (22%) were performed at one centre; two centres conducted six (10%) and seven (11%) procedures, and 27 centres performed a single REBOA within the three-year period. The use of REBOA is extremely rare in the DACH. Only a few centres perform REBOA more than once per year. A striking proportion of patients treated with REBOA had no hypotension, received no blood or massive transfusions, and underwent no emergency surgery, which may indicate that some patients were not in severe haemorrhage when REBOA was applied. On average, the REBOA-treated cohort was severely injured and critically ill. Whether REBOA use was beneficial and/or necessary in these patients cannot be determined from the present study."

We present a case series of four patients with penetrating gastric, hepatic, and pulmonary injuries successfully managed using MIS, highlighting its role in emergency care. Four hemodynamically stable patients presented to the ED with penetrating abdominal or thoracic trauma: (1) Stab wound to epigastrium: Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a 1 cm anterior gastric body perforation, repaired laparoscopically. The patient recovered uneventfully and remained asymptomatic at 3-year follow-up. (2) Gunshot to upper abdomen: Laparoscopic wedge resection of a gastric cardia perforation was performed. Recovery was uneventful, with 1-year follow-up showing no complications. (3) Gunshot to right upper abdomen with hepatic injury: Laparoscopic hemostasis and bullet extraction under fluoroscopy were successfully performed. Four-year follow-up was uneventful. (4) Gunshot to left upper chest: Video-assisted thoracoscopic left upper lobe segmentectomy and bullet extraction were carried out. Five-year follow-up revealed preserved pulmonary function and no complications. Early identification and triage in the ED, combined with MIS, enabled rapid diagnosis and definitive treatment while minimizing morbidity. Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy provide excellent visualization, reduce unnecessary open procedures, and shorten hospital stays. MIS is a safe, effective, and feasible approach for selected hemodynamically stable penetrating thoracic and abdominal injuries in the ED. Careful patient selection and surgical expertise are essential for optimizing outcomes."

    "title": "Surgical Retrieval of Protective Guidewire That Spontaneously Fractured in the RCA and Penetrated the Vessel.",
    "abstract": "Guidewire fracture is a rare and serious complication of percutaneous coronary intervention, especially when it is \"standing by\" as a protective one. We present a case in which a protective guidewire in the right coronary artery spontaneously fractured during percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion lesion of the left anterior descending artery. The fractured guidewire pierced the vessel and entered the pericardium before any measures could be taken, and a percutaneous retrieval attempt using the twisting wire technique failed. The patient developed cardiac tamponade, and emergency surgery was performed to remove the fractured guidewire. Greater prudence is required when choosing guidewires during percutaneous coronary intervention. Coiled guidewires may not be suitable for use as a protective guidewire."

    "title": "UK Resuscitation Advanced Life Support Guidelines: Should the Paradigm be Extended?",
    "abstract": "Cardiac arrest continues to be a predominant cause of mortality worldwide, necessitating its rapid identification, and intervention by reversible aetiologies to optimise successful outcomes. The established 4H 4T framework has served as a foundational guide for advanced life support (ALS) protocols since its formal introduction in the 2000 International Guidelines on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC), effectively targeting critical conditions such as hypoxia, hypothermia, hypo-/hyperkalaemia, hypovolaemia, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, thrombosis, and exposure to toxins. However, this framework inadequately addresses other significant factors: specifically hypoglycaemia and tachy- and bradyarrhythmias. Hypoglycaemia, a reversible and treatable metabolic state, poses substantial threats to cardiovascular stability, particularly in people with diabetes and in association with sepsis. It disrupts myocardial repolarisation, prolongs the QT interval, and may instigate the R-on-T phenomenon, which can precipitate life-threatening arrhythmias. Likewise, tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias often precipitate cardiac arrest, thereby warrant dedicated attention within ALS protocols. This paper advocates expanding the current 4H 4T framework to include hypoglycaemia and tachy- and bradyarrhythmias as critical and reversible causes of cardiac arrest (5H 5T). The rationale for such a paradigm shift is supported by evidence from clinical studies, case reports, and experimental models that demonstrate the adverse effect of these conditions on cardiovascular integrity and alert clinicians to look for these reversible factors. The inclusion of these factors into ALS protocols will necessitate revising resuscitation guidelines, modifying training for healthcare practitioners, and including systematic monitoring of blood glucose alongside routine assessment of cardiac rhythm during resuscitation procedures. Future research should focus on elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions, to establish operational thresholds for intervention, and validate their integration into resuscitation frameworks. By expanding the conceptualisation of reversible causes, the proposed 5H/5T framework would offer a more rational and practical approach to the management of cardiac arrest, to improve the survival and recovery of these critically ill patients."

    "abstract": "Clinically apparent cardiac involvement in mycosis fungoides (MF) is a rare phenomenon. A 61-year-old man presented with dyspnea 11 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for MF. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis and effusion analysis confirmed disease relapse isolated to the pericardium in the setting of full donor chimerism. Despite reduction in immunosuppression, relapse with cardiac tamponade later recurred. Combined-modality chemotherapy and radiotherapy was administered. Systemic disease relapse occurred 22 months after isolated pericardial relapse. This unique case of life-threatening isolated cardiac involvement in relapsed MF exposes the heart as a potential sanctuary site that may sequester lymphoma cells from systemic therapies and the graft-versus-lymphoma effect. Optimal management of this rare complication is unknown. Pericardial or myocardial infiltration should be considered in patients with MF presenting with cardiac symptoms, conduction disturbance, or shock."

    "abstract": "Tuberculous pericarditis (TBP) is a rare but potentially life-threatening manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB), representing a clinically important subset of pericarditis cases. Diagnostic uncertainty arises from variable symptoms and the low sensitivity of available tests. Although culture is the gold standard, it is reliable but too slow to enable a timely diagnosis. Acute and fulminant presentations have been reported in immunosuppressed patients. A 61-year-old woman, recently receiving infliximab and corticosteroids for Crohn's disease, presented to the emergency department with signs of sepsis and obstructive shock. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion, prompting urgent pericardiocentesis. Analysis of pericardial fluid was negative for acid-fast bacilli. She remained unwell, with persistently elevated inflammatory markers, bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules, intra- and extra-thoracic lymphadenopathy, and subsequently developed heart failure. After nearly two weeks, endobronchial ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration with Cepheid GeneXpert TB PCR confirmed rifampicin-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This case is unusual because it combines three rare features: fulminant TBP presenting as acute tamponade, reactivation of TB in the setting of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, and transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction following pericardial drainage. It highlights the importance of considering TB pericarditis in immunosuppressed patients, recognizing the limitations of conventional fluid-based diagnostics, and pursuing timely tissue sampling to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy."

We report a 42-year-old female with uncontrolled RA, markedly elevated anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF), and type 2 diabetes mellitus, who presented with severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Rapid accumulation of a large pericardial effusion led to cardiac tamponade, requiring emergency pericardial drainage during a peri-arrest state.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatient outcomes in emergency general surgery (EGS) may be influenced by the time of day, with prior studies suggesting worse outcomes for nighttime procedures. This study examines differences in damage control laparotomy (DCL) utilization and mortality between daytime and nighttime emergent laparotomies.MethodsRetrospective cohort study from January, 2015 to December, 2023 of patients undergoing emergent exploratory laparotomy during either daytime (7:00 AM-5:00 PM) or nighttime (5:00 PM-7:00 AM) was performed. The primary outcome was all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes included DCL rates, complications, critical care metrics, and hospital length of stay. Between-group differences were assessed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of nighttime presentation on DCL and mortality.ResultsAmong 1279 patients, 710 received daytime surgery (56%). Nighttime patients (n = 569, 44%) had higher ASA class 5 proportions (8.6% vs 4.8%, P = .0062) and greater intraoperative vasopressor use (62% vs 52%, P = .0350). Damage control laparotomy was more frequent at night (50.4% vs 38.7%). Mortality was higher for nighttime cases (18.3% vs 14.1%), independent of treatment DCL. Nighttime surgery was associated with significantly greater rates of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use, but durations of these therapies were not significantly different between groups. Nighttime surgery showed an odds ratio of 1.42 for receiving DCL (95% CI 1.06-1.90, P = .017), but it was not clearly associated with mortality.ConclusionsFor EGS patients, nighttime surgery is associated with higher DCL utilization and mortality compared to daytime surgery. These findings are likely due to higher patient acuity and hemodynamic instability at night."

    "abstract": "Trauma is a major health burden in low- to middle-income countries, with penetrating injuries being a leading cause of death. South Africa's trauma rates are estimated to be 5-9 times higher than the global average. Penetrating injuries, compared to blunt trauma, carry higher morbidity and mortality. This study describes the epidemiology and resource burden of penetrating non-extremity injuries presenting to a teriary hospital Emergency Department (ED) in Gqeberha, South Africa. This descriptive retrospective study was conducted at Livingstone Tertiary Hospital (LTH) ED in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape, and included all patients with non-extremity penetrating trauma from 1 June 2020 to 31 January 2021. During the study period, there were 6020 consecutive trauma presentations to the ED, of which 1107 cases met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The study revealed a male predominance, with a male-to-female ratio of 5.6:1 (p < 0.001). The median age was 29 years (range: 1-80 years). Most patients presented over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) [N = 488, 44%, p < 0.001] and after hours on weekdays (N = 444, 40%). Resource utilisation in the ED increased during these periods, including increased diagnostic imaging, procedural interventions, and blood product requests. Of the study participants, 828 (75%) were brought to the ED using private transport. There were a total of 30 deaths (3%), of which 17 (57%) were deceased on arrival in the ED; the remaining 13 deaths (43%) occurred while in the ED or after disposition to a specialist. This study offers insight into the epidemiology and outcomes of non-extremity penetrating trauma, including prolonged hospital stays and ICU admissions. It underscores the need for multidisciplinary prevention strategies, structured trauma systems, and comparative research to guide best practices, improve resource allocation, and reduce the broader economic impact of trauma on individuals and communities."

We report a well-managed case of delayed hemothorax diagnosed on post-treatment computed tomography (CT) and managed through endovascular intervention in a hybrid emergency room system. A 24-year-old woman presented in shock after falling from a height of 10 meters. With no external signs of trauma, initial whole-body CT revealed an unstable pelvic ring fracture with active extravasation. Following resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta, transarterial embolization was performed for pelvic bleeding 1 h after patient arrival. CT performed immediately after embolization revealed a delayed right hemothorax. Selective angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm in a lateral upper intercostal artery branch, which was successfully treated via embolization. In cases of severe blunt trauma requiring invasive interventions, post-treatment CT should be considered even in the absence of abnormalities on the initial scan because of the potential for delayed hemothoraces."

    "abstract": "Rib fractures are common conditions often associated with significant complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, prolonged hospitalisation, and chronic pain. Adequate pain management is crucial to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity in these patients. Despite the wide adoption of multimodal analgesia, the optimal combination of analgesic strategies remains uncertain. To review and synthesize current evidence on analgesic strategies for acute pain management in patients with rib fractures. We conducted a narrative review by searching scientific literature on PubMed and Scopus to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on analgesia for rib fractures from blunt trauma. Included studies assessed pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic and regional anaesthesia interventions. Studies describing surgical treatment of multiple rib fractures or addressing analgesia for non-traumatic causes of rib fractures (e.g. neoplasms) or study design other than RCTs were excluded. Forty-seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Opioids remain the most studied class of analgesics in the context of rib fracture. While effective for acute pain relief, they pose significant risks, especially in the elderly population. Non-opioid agents - especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol -are effective components of opioid-sparing strategies. Thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks offer superior analgesia and respiratory benefits but are associated with a steep learning curve, are time-consuming, and carry a significant risk of procedural complications. Emerging regional anaesthesia techniques, such as the erector spinae plane (ESP) and serratus anterior plane (SAP) blocks, demonstrated promising results due to their ease of administration and favourable safety profiles. Non-pharmacologic approaches, including cryotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and kinesiotaping, represent additional pain relief options, although evidence remains limited. Multimodal analgesia - combining pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic and regional anaesthesia approaches -is considered the most effective strategy to guarantee pain relief in patients with multiple rib fractures. However, substantial heterogeneity remains in the regimens employed. Further research is needed to standardize multimodal analgesic protocols and to assess their impact on long-term, patient-centred outcomes."

    "title": "Grade V AAST Intestinal Vascular Injury Secondary to Blunt Abdominal Trauma: A Case Report From a University Hospital in Saltillo, Mexico.",
    "abstract": "A 65-year-old male with no relevant medical history presented to the emergency department with generalized abdominal pain following blunt trauma caused by a bicycle handlebar impact to the mesogastrium 48 hours prior. The patient initially self-medicated with analgesics without improvement. Upon evaluation, he had stable vital signs, epigastric ecchymosis, decreased peristalsis, and signs of generalized peritonism. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis (17.6 x 109/L). Plain abdominal radiographs showed intestinal loops with diameters within normal limits and a few short air-fluid levels in the left hypochondrium. Notably, the distribution of intraluminal gas in that region revealed a \"string of pearls\" sign, raising suspicion for an obstructive process. An abdominal CT scan revealed inflammatory pelvic changes, mesenteric fat stranding, dilated ileal loops, and free fluid in the pelvic cavity. Exploratory laparotomy showed 150 mL of serosanguineous fluid, a mesenteric border hematoma of the ileum 100 cm from the ileocecal valve, a phlegmon with adhesions, and a 12.5 cm devascularized segment of ileum (bucket handle injury) with necrosis located 120 cm from the ileocecal valve, classified as AAST (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) Grade V injury and signs of acute appendicitis (erythema and fibrinopurulent coating). Resection with end-to-end anastomosis and appendectomy was performed. The patient tolerated oral intake by postoperative day 2 and was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Histopathology confirmed intestinal necrosis with regional peritonitis and periappendicitis. In patients with blunt abdominal trauma, the most frequently affected organs are the spleen, liver, and small intestine. Injuries to these organs can be missed when the trauma mechanism is underestimated; therefore, frequent physical re-evaluation is essential, as a single examination does not completely exclude the presence of injury."

    "title": "Myopericarditis and Pulmonary Edema.",
    "abstract": "This oral board case is intended to be used with senior emergency medicine residents. Pericarditis and myocarditis are two disease entities that refer to inflammation of the pericardium and the myocardium.1 In clinical practice, when they occur together the term myopericarditis is used.1 Myopericarditis is a disease etiology that is uncommonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of all cardiovascular admissions and myopericarditis is even more rare with an unknown exact incidence.2 These pathologies can present with a wide spectrum of complaints varying from a simple case of chest pain to more severe hypotensive pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.2 Since these pathologies primarily affect the younger patient population,2 they require careful consideration by the Emergency Physician (EP) as well as a systematic comprehensive approach to managing these critically ill patients. The majority of cases are of idiopathic origin; however, the causes of pericarditis are divided into infectious and noninfectious, with infectious cases primarily resulting from viral infections.3 Causes of myocarditis, on the other hand, can be divided into infectious, immune-mediated, and toxic.2 Although myopericarditis is a rare disease, its high acuity makes it an important case to enhance the educational experience of emergency medicine residents and their associated faculty. At the end of this oral board session, learners will be able to: 1) Demonstrate the ability to evaluate and treat a somnolent and hypoxic patient, 2) Identify a critical airway situation and manage it with a holistic approach, 3) Interpret the history, physical examination, ECG, and chest x-ray findings and discuss the list of differential diagnoses, 4) Identify a state of cardiogenic shock induced by myopericarditis and treat it appropriately, 5) Assess the presence of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade utilizing bedside echocardiography. This is an oral board case and is implemented in a face-to-face setup or virtually on multiple available technological modalities. This oral mock code was developed for senior emergency medicine residents to prepare for their oral board exams. Each session lasted approximately 25 minutes, with 10 minutes for the case and 15 minutes for debriefing. The case, initially designed as myopericarditis-induced pulmonary edema progressing to shock and rhabdomyolysis, was later simplified because it was challenging for residents to identify all the elements within the time allotted. Positive feedback indicated the case was educational and beneficial, though extending the case duration to 15 minutes was recommended. Performance was assessed using the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies with a scoring scale of 1 - 8, with 1 - 4 being unacceptable performance and 5 - 8 being acceptable. Efficacy was determined by case completion and participation in structured debriefing. Immediate verbal feedback and a post-session Likert-scale survey further supported its educational value. The case is also adaptable for simulation-based group learning. Five senior residents (three PGY4 and two PGY3) completed the oral case, achieving an average score of 6.01/8, with only one resident completing all critical actions. The most commonly missed intervention was administering aspirin or ibuprofen, and none considered advanced circulatory support despite persistent hypotension. The case was rated highly for educational value (5/5), all of them reported that it increased their medical knowledge, and it was similar to real-life scenarios. Some also noted it increased their confidence level and the case difficulty was rated as moderate (3/5) by the majority of the residents. The educational content of this case is effective because it is multifaceted and requires consideration of multiple factors during both the approach and management. These elements produce an excellent case for discussion, practice, and examination. Points learned while implementing the case were that, 1) its degree of difficulty is more suitable for senior rather than junior learners because it involves a critically ill patient with multiple simultaneous issues to be managed, 2) it requires a well-rounded and systematic approach to achieve all critical actions, and 3) the appropriate prompts should be utilized to cover all aspects in the allotted 15 minutes for the case.

    "abstract": "Abdominal ultrasound (AUS) is increasingly utilized as a diagnostic adjunct in neonates undergoing evaluation for intestinal injuries such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), volvulus, and intestinal obstruction, which need urgent surgical evaluation and often emergent intervention. However, the interpretability of AUS-defined as the number of explicit documentations of high-risk ultrasound findings (HRF)-varies in radiology reports, potentially influenced by clinical and technical factors. To identify clinical and technical factors associated with increased interpretability of neonatal AUS in the evaluation of suspected intestinal injury needing surgical intervention. This retrospective, single-center case series reviewed AUS exams performed from 2022 to 2024 at a level IV neonatal intensive care unit. All neonates who had AUS performed prior to exploratory laparotomy were included in the study. For this project \"interpretability of AUS\" was defined as the number of explicit reporting of eight predefined HRF indicative of surgical need: pneumoperitoneum, increased or decreased bowel wall thickness, reduced intestinal perfusion on color Doppler, absent or decreased peristalsis, bowel dilation, complex intra-abdominal fluid collections, and reversed orientation of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Clinical and technical factors that may have potentially influenced interpretability were analyzed. Twenty-eight AUS exams from 18 neonates were analyzed. The median gestational age at birth was 34+2 weeks, and the median birth weight was 1.93 kg. The median HRF of all AUS exams were 2 (range 0-8). Higher-frequency ultrasound transducers (>10 MHz) improved interpretability of AUS images (HRF 4 vs. 1), particularly in neonates weighing <2 kg. Serial ultrasound evaluations within seven days of surgery were associated with greater interpretability compared to a single isolated exam (HRF 6 vs. 3). Clinical symptoms with hypotension or abdominal discoloration and examinations ordered with comprehensive clinical details for the attention of radiology team showed trends towards improved interpretability. In our pilot study, interpretability of neonatal AUS images was strongly influenced by using higher-frequency transducers (>10 MHz) with better resolution, particularly in neonates weighing <2 kg. Obtaining serial imaging improved subsequent interpretability."

    "abstract": "Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder characterized by persistent eosinophilia, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction. Despite its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, cardiac and neurological complications are the most significant contributors to patient disability and mortality. We report the case of a 66-year-old man who was emergently admitted to the hospital with the chief complaint of \"sudden unsteady walking accompanied by deviation of the corner of the mouth for 15 hours\". Laboratory tests revealed a significantly elevated eosinophil percentage (47.4%, count: 6.76×109/L). Initial diagnostic evaluation, including head computed tomography (CT) combined with CT angiography and CT perfusion, showed no significant abnormalities. However, magnetic resonance imaging confirmed an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia-paraventricular area. To control hypereosinophilia, dexamethasone (10 mg/day) was initiated. Due to the patient's suboptimal therapeutic response, treatment was escalated to prednisolone (15 mg three times a day) for intensive management 2 days later. Following clinical stabilization, the regimen was transitioned back to dexamethasone for maintenance therapy (2.25 mg once daily at discharge), in accordance with standard steroid tapering protocols in HES. On the seventh day, the patient developed sudden signs of generalized peritonitis, and imaging revealed intestinal ischemia. By the tenth day, the classic triad of strangulated intestinal obstruction had emerged; that is, progressive abdominal pain, positive fecal occult blood (+++), and CT findings of a pneumoportogram with terminal ileal wall edema. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed extensive intestinal necrosis, necessitating radical intestinal resection and jejunostomy. Following stepwise management, digestive tract reconstruction (jejunostomy reduction and end-to-side anastomosis of the small intestine and colon) was successfully performed. Current follow-up indicates a good prognosis. This case provides valuable clinical insights into the early identification and management of thrombotic critical conditions secondary to idiopathic HES. It also highlights multi-dimensional intervention strategies for short bowel syndrome, expanding post-intestinal resection management pathways."

This study retrospectively analyzed cases of PCI to provide insights into management strategies and outcomes. A retrospective observational study was conducted on 43 patients with PCI who underwent surgical management at our institution between 2008 and 2023. Eligible cases included patients who were alive upon hospital admission and had PCI confirmed intraoperatively during thoracotomy. Patients with incomplete or missing clinical records were excluded. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were extracted for analysis. The mean age was 33.8 ± 15.1 (15-80). Most patients had stabbed penetrating wounds (88.4%). The time from the injury to the hospital was 70 minutes. PCI at the region of \"cardiac box\" accounted for 83.7%. Hemorrhagic shock and cardiac tamponade upon arrival at the hospital occurred in 60% and 62% of the patients, respectively. Median sternotomy and left anterolateral thoracotomy were the most frequently used procedures, accounting for 97.7%. The most frequent injuries were simple wounds of the right ventricle (46.5%) and simple wounds of the left ventricle (27.9%). Intraoperative blood transfusion volume was 1513.1 ± 984.6 mL. Of 43 patients, 37 survived to hospital discharge (86.0%), while 6 patients died (4 intraoperatively and 2 postoperatively. Postdischarge follow-up revealed interventricular septal hypokinesia in 3 patients and a conal ventricular septal defect in one patient. This retrospective observational study delineates the surgical management and outcomes of PCI at a tertiary institution in Vietnam. While highlighting the importance of timely surgical intervention, its retrospective and observational nature limits causal interpretation. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and guide standardized management."

    "title": "Impact of collective orientation on the quality of teamwork of emergency medical personnel in simulated prehospital emergency medical care - a prospective observational study.",
    "abstract": "High-responsibility teams in prehospital emergency medicine regularly face multidimensional challenges. Collaboration in such teams is vital for the care, safety and outcome of our patients. Collective Orientation (CO) is simply defined as the individual willingness to work with others in a team. Collective Orientation has been proven to have a positive effect on team performance in clinical healthcare. However, data on prehospital emergency medicine is still lacking. This prospective observational study measured the collective orientation of n = 64 paramedic students in their third year of training using a validated questionnaire. Teams were formed based on the students’ collective orientation (high or low). Two simulation scenarios (tension pneumothorax and bronchospasm) were evaluated using the Time Key Item Product (TKIP) and Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM). There was no significant difference in the speed and completeness of patient care (TKIP) between low (M = 6605) and high (M = 6967) Collective Orientation (p = 0.133). There was no significant difference in time to diagnosis between low (M = 384 s) and high (M = 405 s) CO (p = 0.128). Teams with high CO undoubtedly achieved better results in teamwork-relevant factors. These factors include leadership (p = 0,031), teamwork (p = 0,052) and task management (p = 0,038). There was no significant difference between low and high CO when using cognitive aids (p = 0,471) or the 10-for-10 principle (p = 0,735). Collective Orientation must be considered a component of paramedics’ competence to act in paramedic education, as it is characteristic of good teamwork. Further research is needed. The study suggests that Collective Orientation only works in highly complex emergencies outside of linear standard operating procedures or when combined with unanticipated complications. It is clear that leading symptoms that require a wide differential diagnosis demonstrate the value of a high collective orientation.

    "title": "Orbital Compartment Syndrome as a Complication of Blepharoplasty: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Acute vision loss constitutes a true medical emergency, as a delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent visual impairment. Orbital compartment syndrome is most commonly associated with blunt trauma causing a retro-orbital hematoma and resulting compromise of the optic nerve. Orbital compartment syndrome, however, can occur in other scenarios including status post blepharoplasty. This is a case of a 67-year-old male who presented less than 24 hours after a bilateral upper blepharoplasty due to decreased visual acuity of his right eye. A lateral canthotomy was performed despite the absence of elevated intraocular pressures on tonometry. He regained visual acuity in his right eye shortly after the cantholysis. It is vital to consider the range of entities that can cause orbital compartment syndrome, including blepharoplasty. Recognition and emergent intervention improved the visual acuity in this case."

    "abstract": "Paratubal borderline tumors are exceptionally rare, particularly when presenting as giant adnexal masses complicated by torsion. Their clinical and radiological features often mimic ovarian lesions, and diagnosis is often only clarified intraoperatively or after definitive histological examination. This report highlights the diagnostic challenges and fertility-sparing management in a young woman with a giant paratubal serous borderline tumor. A 25-year-old nulliparous woman presented with acute abdominal pain and distension. Transabdominal ultrasonography by a senior obstetrician-gynecologist revealed a large left adnexal cystic mass (17 × 13 × 9 cm) with minimal vascular flow on Doppler. Laboratory results showed a normal complete blood count and serum CA-125 of 18.06 U/mL (reference <35 U/mL). No MRI was performed due to the emergency presentation with suspected torsion and limited availability. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a torsed giant left paratubal cyst; a fertility-sparing left salpingectomy was performed, preserving the ovary. Histopathology confirmed a serous borderline tumor arising from the paratubal region. This case illustrates the diagnostic difficulty of distinguishing paratubal from ovarian tumors, particularly in emergency torsion. MRI, frozen section, and extended tumor markers may aid diagnosis but are often unavailable in resource-limited settings. Fertility-sparing surgery remains a feasible option in carefully selected young patients, supported by literature showing favorable outcomes. Giant paratubal serous borderline tumors with torsion are rare and diagnostically challenging. Clinicians should consider paratubal origin in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. Recognition of limitations in low-resource settings and prioritization of fertility preservation are essential for optimal patient care."

    "abstract": "Norovirus is a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in children and is typically a self-limiting illness. Cardiac complications are exceptionally rare. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hemopericardium associated with norovirus infection in a child. We describe a 20-month-old previously healthy boy who presented with respiratory distress and fatigue two weeks after an episode of acute norovirus gastroenteritis. Investigations revealed severe anemia, elevated D-dimer, and a large hemorrhagic pericardial effusion with echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Extensive workup excluded trauma, coagulopathy, autoimmune disease, and other infectious causes. The patient underwent urgent pericardiocentesis, draining 200 mL of hemorrhagic fluid. He improved rapidly and remained asymptomatic, with serial echocardiograms showing complete resolution of the effusion up to six weeks post-discharge. Hemopericardium is a rare but life-threatening complication of pediatric norovirus infection. Clinicians should consider cardiac involvement in children with unexplained cardiopulmonary findings following viral gastroenteritis. Early echocardiography and prompt intervention are essential for favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Shock index (SI), the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure, is a valuable prognostic tool for assessing shock severity and predicting morbidity and mortality in trauma. Emergency department (ED) triage SI shows promise as an alternative prognostic tool for predicting hospital admission and inpatient mortality in adults. Pediatric age-adjusted shock index (SIPA) has been validated for identification of mortality in children with blunt trauma. To determine whether ED triage SIPA can be used to predict disposition. Retrospective chart review of patients aged 4-20 years who were either admitted or discharged from a quaternary care pediatric ED in 2019. Initial SIPA values were characterized as high or low based on established age-based cutoffs. Association between high SIPA and inpatient admission was evaluated. There were 29,064 eligible ED encounters in the study period. High triage SIPA was associated with female sex, age less than 12 years old, emergency severity index 1-2, and clinical conditions involving fever, sepsis, dehydration and respiratory distress. Overall, those with high triage SIPA were 2.4 (95% CI 2.21-2.60) times more likely to be admitted. Among admitted patients, high triage SIPA was associated with higher odds of intensive care unit admission (OR 3.2; 95% CI 2.5-4.2) and higher odds of rapid response (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.8-8.7) within the first 24 hours on the inpatient unit. Elevated triage SIPA is associated with higher odds of admission, intensive care unit admission and rapid response in first 24 hours of admission."

    "abstract": "Invasive pneumococcal disease, presenting as purulent pericarditis, is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Early recognition and targeted antimicrobial and supportive interventions are essential to improve outcomes, particularly in high-risk patients. A 62-year-old male with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted with community-acquired pneumonia, following a five-day history of respiratory symptoms prior to hospitalization. A thorax CT scan revealed left lower lobe consolidation and bilateral pleural effusion. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. As transthoracic echocardiography showed pericardial effusion and due to signs of myopericarditis, colchicine and lysine acetylsalicylate were added to the treatment. On the second inpatient day, he developed respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability with atrial fibrillation. A transthoracic echocardiography was repeated, which showed worse pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade. Emergent ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with purulent drainage. An immediate hemodynamic improvement was assessed. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from blood and sputum cultures, with sensitivity to the initial antibiotics. The pericardial fluid showed intense neutrophilic inflammation, though culture was negative. The patient recovered without surgical intervention and was discharged after 14 days of antibiotics, four weeks of corticosteroids, and three months of colchicine. No signs of constrictive disease were observed on the follow-up medical appointment. This case highlights the importance of vigilance for cardiac complications in invasive pneumococcal disease. In the presence of bacteremia and pericardial effusion, echocardiographic monitoring is crucial, as even small effusions can rapidly progress to tamponade. Prompt drainage, adequate antimicrobial therapy, and multidisciplinary care are key to successful outcomes."

    "abstract": "T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which usually affects adolescents and young adults. The usual presentation is characterized by B symptoms and adenopathy associated with a mediastinal mass. Here we describe a rare case of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in an adolescent, presenting as cardiac tamponade. The patient is a 17-year-old Moroccan adolescent with no medical history who presented with dyspnea. Echocardiography showed a large pericardial effusion, collapse of the right cavities, and noncompressible dilatation of the inferior vena cava. This tamponade picture required an emergency pericardiocentesis, and the thoracic computed tomography scan showed a mediastinal mass of 132 × 105 mm. Pleuropericardial biopsy made the diagnosis of certainty of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. The complementary management consisted of a combination of chemotherapy.

Serial echocardiograms over approximately 16 hours demonstrated the development of cardiac tamponade and obstructive shock. Emergency pericardiocentesis yielded purulent fluid, which grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite hemodynamic improvement, she subsequently developed constrictive physiology (CP), which was diagnosed with cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance. This case illustrates an uncommon and life-threatening presentation of purulent pericarditis. The patient's rapid progression highlights the importance of early recognition and timely drainage. Additionally, the development of CP emphasizes the need for appropriate diagnostic modalities. Purulent pericarditis is a rare condition that may present without a clear infectious source. It may be complicated by the development of CP, and both cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance are important diagnostic tools."

Early recognition and intervention are essential to prevent complications such as abscess formation, necrosis, or testicular loss. We report the case of a 39-year-old diabetic male with chronic alcoholism who presented with progressive left scrotal pain and swelling following a minor motorcycle accident. Ultrasonography confirmed rupture of the tunica vaginalis and collection of purulent fluid consistent with pyocele. Emergency incision and drainage were performed, and pus culture revealed Staphylococcus aureus, which was managed successfully with targeted antibiotics and analgesics. The patient recovered completely without complications. Scrotal pyocele is an uncommon sequela of blunt trauma, more often associated with infectious etiologies. In this case, ultrasonography played a crucial role in differentiating pyocele from hematocele and guiding early surgical intervention. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and chronic alcoholism increased infection risk, yet timely drainage and culture-directed therapy led to preservation of testicular function. The isolation of S. aureus is unusual compared to more typical urinary pathogens reported in previous literature. Traumatic scrotal pyocele is a rare but potentially life-threatening entity. Prompt diagnosis, surgical drainage, and culture-based antibiotic therapy are critical to favorable outcomes and testicular preservation."

    "abstract": "Firearm-related vascular trauma is a significant public health issue in Cape Town, South Africa, where gunshot wounds (GSWs) are a leading cause of penetrating extremity injuries. This commentary reviews the experience of Groote Schuur Hospital's Trauma Centre in managing extremity arterial injuries due to GSWs. Groote Schuur Hospital is a tertiary academic institution situated in Cape Town, South Africa. As one of the country's foremost teaching hospitals, we serve a population of approximately 4 million people from the greater Cape Town metropolitan area and surrounding regions. On average, we manage approximately 1000 trauma patients per month, including both blunt and penetrating trauma. We are a designated Level 1 Trauma Centre, offering comprehensive emergency trauma care. Our facility is equipped with advanced imaging modalities, including Lodox full-body radiography, standard X-rays, CT scanning, MRI, and interventional radiology. We also have 24-h access to fully staffed and operational trauma theatres, ensuring timely surgical intervention when required. The institutional approach emphasizes life-saving interventions, restoration of perfusion, limb preservation, and function. Vascular trauma, though infrequent, is more common in penetrating than blunt injuries, with the brachial and femoral arteries most commonly affected. Patient management is dictated by hemodynamic status and limb viability, using ATLS® principles and tools like the ankle-brachial index (ABI), arterial pressure index (API), duplex ultrasound, and computed tomography angiography (CTA). While open surgery remains the cornerstone for definitive repair, endovascular techniques are increasingly utilized in selected cases. Fasciotomy plays a critical role in preventing compartment syndrome in high-risk patients. Outcomes are influenced by injury severity, time to intervention, and associated injuries, with delayed care contributing significantly to limb loss and mortality. Although patient and limb survival is achievable with timely management, long-term complications, including graft failure, chronic pain, and psychological impact, are common. Improving outcomes requires systemic investment in trauma care, from prehospital triage to post-operative rehabilitation and follow-up."

    "title": "Rare occurrence of small bowel intussusception due to synchronous metastasis of renal cell carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Renal carcinoma is the third most common urological cancer, with 30% of patients presenting with metastases at diagnosis. Metastases to the small intestine are rare (0.7-1.1%), and their presentation as intestinal intussusception is even more uncommon, with only a few cases reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to present a case of stage IV clear cell renal carcinoma with a rare presentation of intestinal intussusception, leading to emergency department admission due to severe anemia and melena. A 62-year-old man presented with melena for 2 months and a critically low hemoglobin level of 2.9 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL). Abdominal and pelvic angiotomography identified an exophytic lesion in the left kidney consistent with renal carcinoma and an approximately 16 cm ileal intussusception. Exploratory laparotomy revealed intestinal intussusception and a 4 cm lesion on the antimesenteric border, suspected to be a tumor. A segmental resection with primary anastomosis was performed, resulting in a favorable postoperative recovery. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed poorly differentiated metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma. This report underscores the need to consider gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with renal carcinoma, as an intestinal metastasis, although rare, is a potential complication. Synchronous metastases are even rarer and present a significant diagnostic challenge. O carcinoma renal é o terceiro câncer urológico mais frequente, sendo que 30% dos pacientes apresentam metástases já ao diagnóstico. Raramente são encontradas metástases no intestino delgado (0,7–1,1%), e ainda menos frequente é a apresentação da metástase como intussuscepção intestinal, com poucos relatos na literatura até então. Relatar o caso de paciente com carcinoma de células claras renais em estágio IV, cuja rara apresentação foi manifestada por intussuscepção intestinal e admissão em serviço de emergência por anemia grave e melena. Homem, 62 anos, admitido com melena há 2 meses e achado crítico de hemoglobina de 2,9 g/dL (normal 13,5–17,5g/dL). Realizada angiotomografia de abdome e pelve com achado de lesão exofítica em rim esquerdo compatível com neoplasia primária e intussuscepção de alça ileal, por cerca de 16 cm. Foi submetido a laparotomia exploradora, com identificação de intussuscepção intestinal a 80 cm do ângulo de Treitz, e lesão de 4 cm na borda antimesentérica, suspeita para acometimento neoplásico. Foi realizada enterectomia segmentar com anastomose primária, com boa evolução pós operatória. O resultado anatomopatológico e imunohistoquímica foram compatíveis com carcinoma pouco diferenciado células claras renais metastático. O doente apresentado traz a importância de se manter suspeição para sintomas gastrointestinais em pacientes com diagnóstico de carcinoma renal, tendo em vista a possibilidade, ainda que em raros casos, de metástase intestinal. Há de se ressaltar, que em caso de metástases sincrônicas, o diagnóstico é ainda mais incomum e o grau de suspeição mais desafiador."

    "title": "Prevalence of ghost scans in point-of-care ultrasound for trauma patients: A multicenter study.",
    "abstract": "Ghost scanning refers to when a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is performed, but no images are saved. This is a common, yet understudied, problem with POCUS examinations and has consequences for patient care, billing, and quality assurance. Previous studies were single-site and have shown a high rate of ghost scanning, but there is a lack of direct comparison across institutions. The study aim was to compare the prevalence of ghost scanning across multiple institutions for patients with trauma activations who received an Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (eFAST) examination. This was a multi-center, retrospective cohort study that took place between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2023. Study sites included four urban Level 1 trauma centers with emergency medicine residencies and emergency ultrasound fellowships. Inclusion criteria were emergency department patients >18 years old who arrived as the highest level of trauma activation at each site. Patients were excluded if there was incomplete or missing electronic medical record (EMR) data, if the patient was determined to not be a trauma by EMR review, or if the patient was downgraded from a trauma. Investigators manually reviewed EMR documentation for performance of an eFAST examination, and then searched their respective image repository for corresponding saved images. The primary study outcome was the prevalence of ghost scanning at each site. Descriptive statistics were reported, along with site comparisons using an ANOVA test with a post-hoc Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD). Secondary outcomes included a comparison of ghost scanning rates for each site broken down both by trauma type (blunt or penetrating) and eFAST examination result (positive or negative). A total of 6078 patients were included in the analysis from the four study sites. Approximately 35 % (2182) of all trauma activations had an eFAST performed, ranging from a low of 24.5 % (444) to a high of 49.0 % (596). The overall ghost scanning rate was 49.8 % for the cohort, with 1086 images saved. The ghost scanning rate across institutions was highly variable, and ranged from 21.1 % to 93.2 % at the included sites. There was a significant difference between all sites when compared as independent pairs (p < 0.001). A statistically significant decrease in ghost scanning rates for positive eFAST examinations was seen at site 2 (p = 0.001), and site 3 had a statistically significant increase in ghost scanning rates for penetrating trauma (p = 0.02). Ghost scanning is problematic and has implications for accreditation, liability, billing, quality assurance, and patient care. There was variable, but universally high rates, of ghost scanning for patients with a trauma activations at the included sites. These results show that ghost scanning continues to be a concern in the emergency department and further studies are needed to test interventions to decrease its rates."

    "abstract": "To estimate advisability of laparoscopic selective clipping of splenic artery branches for isolated splenic trauma in hemodynamically stable patients. Treatment outcomes were analyzed in 584 patients with blunt abdominal trauma in 2024. Isolated splenic trauma, classified according to AAST, was diagnosed in 45 (7.71%) cases. We performed emergency laparotomy and splenectomy in 13 (28.9%) patients from this group (unstable hemodynamics, trauma grade II-V). Selective endovascular embolization of splenic artery branches was made in 15 (33.3%) hemodynamically stable patients (grade I - IV). Five (11.1%) patients (grade III-IV) with stable hemodynamics underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and selective clipping of splenic artery branches. Non-operative management (NOM) without angioembolization were used in 12 (26.7%) patients. Mean surgery time was 92±6 min, intraoperative blood loss - 260±128 ml. Contrast enhanced CT within 24-72 hours after laparoscopic selective clipping revealed regression of subcapsular hematoma in the spleen. Mean length of hospital-stay was 6.4±1.8 days. Complications occurred in 2 patients (Clavien-Dindo grade I and II, respectively). Laparoscopic selective clipping of splenic artery branches in hemodynamically stable patients is effective for surgical hemostasis and excludes «vain» laparotomy. Besides, laparoscopic selective clipping preserves quality of life due to normal spleen function and prevention of such complications after splenectomy as severe sepsis and hyposplenism. Оценка результатов и возможности применения малотравматичного метода лечения — лапароскопического селективного клипирования ветвей селезеночной артерии при изолированной травме селезенки у гемодинамически стабильных пациентов. Проанализированы результаты лечения 584 пациентов с диагнозом «закрытая травма органов брюшной полости», госпитализированных в экстренном порядке в ММНКЦ им. С.П. Боткина за 2024 г. В 45 (7,71%) случаях выявлено изолированное повреждение селезенки, классифицированное по степени тяжести в соответствии с критериями AAST. Из указанных больных 13 (28,9%) с учетом нестабильной гемодинамики и наличия гемоперитонеума потребовалось выполнение экстренной лапаротомии, спленэктомии, в результате повреждений II—V степени по AAST. У 15 (33,3%) пациентов со стабильной гемодинамикой (I—IV степени по AAST) выполнена селективная рентгенэндоваскулярная эмболизация ветвей селезеночной артерии. В 5 (11,1%) случаях — гемодинамически стабильным пациентам (III—IV степени по AAST) выполнена диагностическая лапароскопия, осуществлен гемостаз посредством селективного клипирования ветвей селезеночной артерии. Стратегия «без хирургического вмешательства» (non-operative management — NOM) без ангиоэмболизации применена у 12 (26,7%) пациентов. Средняя продолжительность операции составила 92±6 мин, средняя интраоперационная кровопотеря — 260±128 мл. Всем пациентам после проведения лапароскопического селективного клипирования ветвей селезеночной артерии в послеоперационном периоде (в течение 24—72 ч) выполняли компьютерную томографию (КТ) органов брюшной полости с внутривенным болюсным контрастированием, при которой отмечался регресс субкапсулярной гематомы селезенки. Средняя длительность пребывания пациентов в стационаре составила 6,4±1,8 сут. У 2 пациентов отмечено развитие послеоперационных осложнений, классифицированных по Clavien—Dindo: в одном случае — I степени, в другом случае — II степени. Лапароскопическое селективное клипирование ветвей селезеночной артерии у гемодинамически стабильных пациентов позволяет избежать выполнения «напрасной» лапаротомии, является эффективной и прецизионной хирургической методикой достижения гемостаза. Кроме того, лапароскопическое селективное клипирование ветвей селезеночной артерии дает возможность сохранить полноценное качество жизни пациента за счет сохранения функции органа и предотвращения таких грозных осложнений после выполненной спленэктомии, как постспленэктомический сепсис и гипоспленизм."

    "abstract": "Traumatic pneumothoraces occur in 25% of patients sustaining traumatic chest injury. Tube thoracostomy carries a risk of major complications leading to the necessity of tube thoracostomy insertion for traumatic pneumothoraces to be challenged. This meta-analysis analyses current evidence relating to the management of traumatic pneumothorax and synthesises the evidence to determine whether clinicians can safely omit tube thoracostomy in patients with traumatic pneumothorax presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). This meta-analysis was performed by searching electronic databases. Papers were included for analysis if they used patients sustaining blunt trauma and compared tube thoracostomy to conservative management. Comparisons were made for those undergoing tube thoracostomy and those undergoing conservative management. Fourteen studies comprising 1550 patients were included. There is a non-significant combined pneumothorax progression rate of 12% for those observed, and 7.6% for those with a tube thoracostomy (p = 0.8447) with an odds ratio of 1.33. There was an 11.9% rate for tube thoracostomy insertion among patients observed, and a 10.4% requirement for further tube thoracostomy placement in those already with a tube thoracostomy (p = 0.3436) with an odds ratio of 0.553. For patients receiving positive pressure ventilation, the rates were 18% in observed patients compared to 9% of those with a tube thoracostomy (p = 0.2848) with an odds ratio of 4.123. Conservative management of traumatic pneumothorax without positive pressure ventilation is a reasonable initial safe approach in the ED. Only ~12% of these patients will eventually require a tube thoracostomy."

It can appear anywhere across the abdominal wall. The most common type of hernia is inguinal, which affects the groove between the abdomen and thigh. We discuss the case of a 75-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital after presenting with a large right-sided inguinoscrotal hernia, which had been gradually growing for the last three years. The patient had acute pain, hard swelling, and redness for the past three days. The general assessment revealed a large irreducible hernia, which was tender in the area of erythema. An emergency CT of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) demonstrated a perforated ascending colon with the formation of abscesses within the hernia. The management involved an exploratory laparotomy, which showed evidence of a strangulated hernia; there was extensive ischaemia and congestion of the terminal ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and omentum. The surgical interventions included right hemicolectomy with ileostomy, drainage of the abscess in the abdominal wall, and hydrocelectomy. Postoperatively, the patient remained in the ICU for two days after the surgery; he developed a minor complication (surgical site infection (SSI) grade 1) and was later transferred to the ward and discharged after a week."

It is rare for a uterine leiomyoma to present with a massive hemoperitoneum; only a few cases have been reported in the literature. We present the case of a 41-year-old Ghanaian female with a history of bilateral tubal ligation who presented to the emergency department with syncope and severe abdominal pain. Initial evaluation revealed hypotension, tachycardia, and significant free intraperitoneal fluid on ultrasound. An exploratory laparotomy identified a massive hemoperitoneum secondary to a ruptured vessel overlying a uterine fibroid, necessitating subtotal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy.

    "abstract": "Abdominopelvic (A/P) computed tomography (CT) is frequently used in trauma evaluation, yet often yields clinically insignificant findings, especially in minor blunt trauma. Overuse of CT is associated with radiation exposure, contrast risks, and unnecessary healthcare costs. To derive a clinical decision instrument (DI) to guide selective A/P CT imaging in adult patients presenting with minor blunt trauma. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults presenting to the emergency department with minor blunt trauma and underwent A/P CT in the emergency department (ED) of Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center between 2018 and 2022. Clinically meaningful A/P injuries were defined as those necessitating therapeutic intervention or hospital admission for observation. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of injury. Diagnostic performance was assessed using ROC analysis, calculating its sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV). Among 894 patients (median age 43.8 years, 62.2% male), 89 (9.9%) experienced clinically meaningful outcomes. The DI incorporated five independent predictors for clinically meaningful injury: Distracting injury (aOR 5.5 [95% CI 2.9-10.4], p < 0.001), Abdominal / pelvic pain and/or tenderness (aOR 2.8 [95% CI: 1.5-5.0], p < 0.001), Abdominal / pelvic bruises/hematoma (aOR 2.2 [95% CI 1.2-4.1], p = 0.008), and chronic disease (aOR 2.8 [95% CI: 1.4-5.7], p = 0.003), and abnormal pelvic radiograph (predefined as mandatory). Application of the DI would have recommended imaging in 479 patients (53.3%). The DI achieved sensitivity of 96.6% (95% CI: 90.5-98.8%), specificity of 51.2% (95% CI: 47.5-54.8%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.3% (95% CI: 97.9-99.8%). ROC analysis demonstrated an AUC of 0.74 (p = 0.02). Of 89 patients with clinically meaningful injuries, 3 (0.3%) did not meet any DI criteria; all were managed conservatively. Our proposed DI demonstrated high sensitivity and NPV while potentially reducing A/P CT utilization by nearly half. Implementation of such a tool may safely decrease unnecessary imaging in minor blunt trauma, minimize radiation and contrast exposure, and improve resource use. Prospective validation is recommended."

    "abstract": "Injuries to the inferior vena cava (IVC) from penetrating trauma are uncommon but carry a high risk of fatality due to the potential for rapid, massive haemorrhage. We present the case of a 56-year-old man who sustained a stab wound to the right lower chest and presented in profound haemorrhagic shock. A bedside extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (eFAST) not only identified free abdominal fluid but also provided a direct, real-time visualisation of a tear in the IVC wall with an adjacent haematoma. Despite immediate surgical intervention, the patient died from his injuries. This case highlights a rare but critical sonographic finding, suggesting that evaluating the IVC during an eFAST exam can be a valuable tool for the early detection of life-threatening vascular injuries in haemodynamically unstable patients."

    "abstract": "Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is a potentially fatal complication associated with postoperative opioid use, even in low-risk populations. The subtle onset and progression of OIRD can delay detection, potentially leading to cardiorespiratory collapse within minutes. A 55-year-old opioid-naïve male who underwent emergency surgery for abdominal penetrating trauma and unstable pelvic fracture. Postoperatively, despite sufentanil-based patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), the patient experienced persistent moderate-to-severe pain. After acute pain service adjustment of PCIA parameters, the patient developed sudden unconsciousness with respiratory depression (respiratory rate, 7 breaths/min), hypoxemia (SpO2, 90%), bilateral 2-mm pinpoint pupils with sluggish reflexes, and generalized rigidity, despite no additional PCIA activations. The critical care team promptly recognized the signs of opioid-induced wooden-chest syndrome, a rare and severe form of OIRD and implemented targeted interventions. Initial administration of naloxone failed to reverse symptoms. The patient required urgent endotracheal intubation, during which marked chest wall rigidity was observed. These timely interventions enabled the successful rescue of the patient, who was transferred back to a general nursing unit on postoperative day 2. This case of OIRD due to opioid-induced wooden-chest syndrome underscores the danger of omitting dose titration in opioid-naïve patients. We therefore advocate for vigilant monitoring, strict titration protocols, and enhanced staff training to manage such emergencies."

    "abstract": "Chest trauma in children presents unique diagnostic challenges due to physiological and anatomical differences from adults. While pulmonary contusion remains the most common injury, meticulous evaluation with CT scan is crucial to rule out occult pathologies and ensure timely intervention for potential complications like alveolar hemorrhage. Pediatric chest trauma mandates a tailored management approach considering their delicate physiology. Early initiation of high-flow oxygen, judicious ventilatory support for acute respiratory distress, and proactive fluid management are essential, while pain control and hemodynamic monitoring remain critical throughout the recovery process. Here, we report a challenging case of a 6-year-old male child presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department with acute moderate-to-severe respiratory distress that was successfully treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The child was brought to our emergency department with only history of mild head trauma that occurred 2 h before presenting to the hospital. After triaging as Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) II, the child was managed in line with acute respiratory distress via ATLS abroach. We ruled out head, cervical spine, and other evidence of invasive chest as well as gross abdominal injuries, by ATLS abroach and adjuncts such as point-of-care ultrasound and chest and abdomen X-rays and PAN CT. Although the initial venous blood gas analyses were suggestive of mixed respiratory an metabolic acidosis, the CXR and the chest CT revealed that the child had significant lung parenchymal injury in the form of bilateral fluffy pulmonary infiltrates. This case indicates that even an uncertain history and absence of physical finding, chest blunt trauma causing lung injury, leading to severe manifestations and sometimes fatal complications such as pulmonary contusion, hemorrhage, and ARDS."

    "abstract": "A 20-year-old primary gravida at 26 weeks of gestation presented with acute abdominal pain. At a rural facility that she had consulted earlier, abdominal pelvic ultrasonography had suggested adnexal pathology, most likely ovarian torsion, and an exploratory laparotomy had been performed. No adnexal pathology had been found, and the procedure had been abandoned. The patient was transferred to our center in hemodynamic instability. Repeat ultrasonography identified a large right subhepatic cystic lesion with differentials including choledochal cyst (CC), benign retroperitoneal cyst, and ovarian/paraovarian cyst. MRIs subsequently confirmed a giant right upper quadrant cyst compressing hepatobiliary structures, correlating with the development of clinical jaundice. This clarified the etiology and eliminated the need for further unnecessary gynecologic surgery. The patient was managed with ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage, which safely decompressed the biliary system, relieved mass effect, and reduced rupture risk in the context of high maternal-fetal surgical risk. The intervention stabilized the patient, facilitated definitive cyst excision before normal vaginal delivery at 36+6 weeks. Based on this experience and a review of the relevant literature, we suggest that in selected cases of undifferentiated abdomino-pelvic cysts during pregnancy, particularly in resource-limited or emergency settings without access to advanced imaging, ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage may be a valuable diagnostic and temporizing measure. This approach can safely bridge patients to definitive management and may help avoid unnecessary laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Uterine rupture during gestation is an uncommon but serious complication involving a complete tear in all layers of the uterine wall. The median occurrence rate of this condition is estimated to be 5.3 per 10,000 total births. This condition is strongly associated with scarred uterus, with approximately 90% of ruptures occurring in women who have had prior uterine surgery while spontaneous uterine rupture of unscarred uterus is exceedingly rare and is a considerably more severe complication, posing a clinical challenge to obstetricians and prompting immediate diagnosis and management to manage the massive hemorrhage. A 44 year-old gravida 3, para 2 Syrian woman at 36 weeks of pregnancy presented with complaints of generalized fatigue and mild lower abdominal pain. The patient reported a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain approximately 2 hours prior to arrival, which resolved spontaneously. She had no significant medical history. On gynecological examination, the patient was not in labor and ultrasound examination demonstrated extramural fetus with a contracted and involuted uterus along with free intraperitoneal fluid, substantially corroborating the diagnosis of spontaneous uterine rupture in the absence of predisposing factors. Our patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, during which the deceased fetus and the placenta were removed from the peritoneal cavity, followed by total hysterectomy, and the follow-up course was uneventful. Spontaneous non-laboring uterine rupture of unscarred uterus may unexpectedly occur even in the absence of predisposing factors. The clinical suspicion is key to avoid confusion with other differential diagnoses. Clinicians must remain vigilant about the atypical presentations of uterine rupture to avoid delayed diagnosis and management of uterine rupture. Ultrasound may substantially corroborate the preoperative diagnosis. Hysterectomy remains the preferred management in cases of severe uterine ruptures."

    "abstract": "Prehospital procedures in urban penetrating trauma (UPT) are controversial. In certain locales, modes of immediate transport, such as police and private vehicle transport, are used with varying frequencies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis and developed evidence-based recommendations on whether UPT patients should receive police or private vehicle transport over waiting for emergency medical services (EMS) transport. Published literature was searched through MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase (via Elsevier), Web of Science (via Clarivate), and CINAHL Complete (via EBSCO) databases by a professional librarian. The date ranges for our literature search were January 1900 to July 2023. A systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available evidence were performed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. A total of six relevant studies were analyzed for police transport, with all being retrospective or prospective, observational studies. The pooled data found that EMS transport did not improve survival to admission (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.35) or discharge (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.84-1.35) over police transport. A total of two relevant studies were analyzed for private vehicle transport, with both being retrospective studies. The pooled data found that private vehicle transport improved survival (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.85) to admission over waiting for EMS transport. In UPT patients, we conditionally recommend police or private vehicle transport over waiting for EMS transport as adjuncts to traditional prehospital care.

    "abstract": "Trauma, a leading cause of disability and death globally, underscores the critical importance of timely medical intervention, particularly within the \"golden hour\" following trauma. Yet, in low-middle-income countries, the absence or fledgling state of emergency medical systems (EMS) exacerbates mortality rates. This study aims to retrospectively analyze mortalities at a level 1 trauma center in India, comparing patients who received prehospital care with those who did not. Conducted at a level 1 trauma center in India from April 2019 to April 2020, this retrospective observational study included trauma patients who died during hospitalization. Exclusions comprised (1) patients deceased upon arrival, (2) patients receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and (3) non-trauma deaths. Demographics, clinical profiles, causes of death, and transportation methods were scrutinized. Data encompassed patient transport details, clinical assessments, interventions, length of stay, and causes of death. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 14, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Among 55,277 trauma patients, 311 mortalities were recorded. Most were male (n=267, 83.9%), aged 21-40 years (n=133, 42.8%), with blunt trauma being the predominant cause (97.4%). The majority of patients had road traffic injuries (n=180, 57.9%) and falls (n=95, 30.5%). Threatened airway (n=144, 46.3%), tachycardia (n=159, 51.2%), and hypotension (n=74, 23.8%) were common on patients' arrival. Traumatic brain injuries (70.4%) prevailed. Private vehicles transported 46.6% of patients, while only 7.0% arrived within the golden hour. Although patients who received prehospital care experienced delayed hospital arrival, they exhibited higher oxygen saturation and systolic blood pressure. Augmentation of prehospital care and EMS infrastructure in low-resource settings is crucial to mitigating trauma mortality. Although prehospital care delayed hospital arrival, it positively impacted physiological parameters and potentially improved patient outcomes. This study underscores the imperative of timely interventions and comprehensive EMS development to address the global trauma burden effectively."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, typically diagnosed in older adults. Jejunal GISTs with spontaneous perforation leading to acute peritonitis are uncommon, particularly in young individuals. We report the case of a 32-year-old male who presented with acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and peritoneal signs. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed pneumoperitoneum and a heterogeneously enhancing mass at the jejunoileal junction, raising suspicion for a perforated GIST. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed a 6 × 6 cm perforated tumor on the antimesenteric border of the jejunum, which was resected with primary anastomosis. Histopathology confirmed a high-grade spindle-cell GIST with increased mitotic activity. The patient recovered well postoperatively and started on adjuvant imatinib therapy following oncological consultation. A four-week post-discharge positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) scan showed no residual disease or metastasis. Perforated jejunal GISTs are rare and carry a high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis if not promptly managed. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment, with adjuvant tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy recommended for high-risk cases. Given the aggressive nature of perforated GISTs, long-term surveillance is essential. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention in perforated jejunal GISTs, particularly in younger patients. Multidisciplinary management with adjuvant therapy and rigorous follow-up is crucial to optimizing outcomes."

    "abstract": "The spontaneous hemopericardium due to warfarin toxicity is uncommon but can be fatal if it leads to cardiac tamponade and timely interventions are not administered. An 80-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, he had tachycardia, hypotension, and muffled heart sounds. The 2-D echocardiogram confirmed pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. An emergent pericardiocentesis was performed in the emergency department (ED), following which the patient hemodynamically improved. The past medical history was significant for recurrent ED visit with warfarin toxicity in the form of calf hematoma. His most recent ED visit was three days ago, where he received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for a supra-therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 8.66 without bleeding manifestations and was discharged with an INR value of 2.27. During the current ED presentation, the hemopericardium was likely due to rebound warfarin toxicity, as the INR reported was found to be 6.38 despite having previously corrected to 2.27 and discontinuing warfarin after the recent ED discharge. In the current ED presentation, coagulopathy was corrected with FFP and vitamin K. The patient was admitted to the ward for evaluation. The pericardial fluid analysis showed no evidence of tuberculosis or other infections, and his recovery was uneventful. On follow-up after 3 months, he was doing well on dabigatran for stroke prevention. The treatment of warfarin toxicity requires consideration of the half-life of the offending agent, warfarin, as well as the antidotes (FFP and vitamin k) widely practiced in low-middle income countries to prevent rebound warfarin toxicity.

This study describes the clinical and psychosocial profile of such injuries in children from southern Tunisia and identifies poor prognostic factors. We conducted a retrospective study of 86 children hospitalized for penetrating ocular injuries at Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax from January 2015 to December 2021. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected, as well as impact on quality of life as measured using two validated psychometric scales. The mean age of the patients was 7.21 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.44. All injuries were unilateral, with 57% affecting the right eye, and most occurred during the summer and on weekends. Corneal injuries were observed in 91.9% of cases, with a mean wound size of 6.24mm. Iris herniation and traumatic cataract were the most common associated lesions. All patients underwent emergency surgery, with a mean delay of 15hours after the injury. At follow-up, 40.7% of patients had developed severe amblyopia, defined as a final visual acuity (FVA) ≤1/10 - the threshold used to define a poor functional prognosis. Poor prognostic factors included low initial visual acuity (IVA≤1/10), visual axis involvement, wound size>5mm, hyphema, aphakia, traumatic cataract, posterior segment involvement, and additional surgeries. The psychosocial impact, especially emotional distress, was significant, exceeding physical impacts. 14.5% of patients suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, requiring specialized psychiatric care. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for these children, but prevention remains the key strategy to reduce such injuries and their long-term consequences."

    "title": "Spontaneous uterine rupture after myomectomy in patients during pregnancy: Clinical cases in a single university center.",
    "abstract": "Uterine rupture is an infrequent yet sometimes fatal complication of a subsequent vaginal birth attempt following a previous uterine surgery. We have chosen to write about spontaneous uterine ruptures following myomectomy due to the scarcity of data on this subject, stemming from the limited number of reported cases. Furthermore, with the increasing trend of advanced maternal age, there is a growing cohort of pregnant women with a history of myomectomy, thereby presenting a timely opportunity to examine this phenomenon in greater depth. A total of 28 studies reporting pregnancies after prior myomectomy, resulting in 3.502 viable (≥24 weeks) deliveries, were reviewed. The overall incidence of uterine rupture after myomectomy of 0.6%, comparable with those reported in other reviews. Our review confirmed that the incidence of uterine rupture is very low, 0.4%, in the group of women who experienced a trial of labor after myomectomy (TOLAM). In particular, the difference of incidences of uterine rupture before or during labor was not statistically significant. Therefore, uterine rupture may not be significantly influenced by a TOLAM and so this option could be considered in pregnant women as feasible and relatively safe. This study presents three medical cases that occurred at our institution in 2023 of pregnant patients who had undergone surgery for myomectomy and experienced uterine rupture out of labor. The first is a clinical case of a 42-year-old woman affected by endometriosis who had undergone laparoscopic myomectomy 1 year before conception. The actual pregnancy was conceived by intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI). The patient presented at 22+4 weeks' gestation to the emergency department (ED) for abdominal pain. On hospital presentation, transabdominal ultrasound evidenced a single fetus, with fetal heart rate 163 beats/min and free fluid in the Morrison's pouch with a blood clot at the uterine fundus. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with and without contrast was performed due to the unclear origin of the hemoperitoneum. CT scan revealed abundant abdominal free fluid, especially perihepatic (3 cm), in the left hypochondrium (2 cm), parieto-colic gutter and anterior the uterus, without contrast spreading; the uterus had inhomogeneous density and profiles. One hour after hospitalization, the patient was admitted to the operating room: a 10 cm fundal uterine rupture with protruding amniotic sac was present. The second is a clinical case of a 32-year-old woman who had undergone laparoscopic myomectomy 23 months before conception. An intramural myoma 6 cm in diameter was located on the posterior wall of the uterus. The patient conceived spontaneously 23 months later. The woman presented at 36+3 weeks' gestation to the ED for irregular uterine contractions (1 uterine contraction every 10-15 min). Three hours after admission, irregular uterine contractions were still present (1 uterine contraction every 10-15 min): the patient was thereby hospitalized. One hour after hospitalization, the patient reported a prolonged contraction and the transabdominal ultrasound check evidenced fetal bradycardia. An immediate cesarean section was performed, showing a massive hemoperitoneum which was promptly drained. After fetal extraction and manual removal of the placenta, a close uterine inspection was performed, showing a 15 cm uterine rupture involving the posterior wall. The third is a clinical case of a 28-year-old woman who had undergone laparoscopic myomectomy 2 years before conception. The patient reported that the uterine cavity was opened to remove an intramural myoma of 6 cm in diameter located on the left anterolateral wall of the uterus. She conceived spontaneously 2 years later, and the course of the pregnancy was uncomplicated. The patient presented at 31+0 weeks' gestation to the ED for abdominal pain. On hospital presentation, transabdominal ultrasound scan evidenced a single fetus with normal heart rate and a growing blood clot at the uterine fundus. The patient was admitted to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy, confirming a massive hemoperitoneum. A 7 cm uterine rupture with protruding amniotic sac was present in the left posterolateral uterine wall. The surgeon hence proceeded to perform hysterotomy, amniorrhexis, fetal extraction of a fetus alive and vital, and manual removal of the placenta. The patient's uterus was surgically repaired with double layer suture. The amount of total blood loss was 1800 mL. A total of four units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused. The patient recovered well and was discharged 7 days after surgery."

    "abstract": "Hybrid Angio-CT suites have emerged in response to the growing demands for innovation and procedural complexity in minimally invasive therapies. It is hypothesized that enhanced image guidance capabilities enabled by multimodality imaging can improve procedural safety, accuracy, and efficacy. However, due to the current lack of sufficient data to support a systematic review, the objective of this article is to present a comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature through a narrative review. This narrative review is based on purposefully identified research reports, their critical evaluation, and synthesis by a group of experienced users. The analysis covers three key areas: (1) current state of available technologies and functionalities, (2) novel perspectives through 'Direct Intravascular Contrast media Injection CT' (DICI-CT), and (3) the role of Angio-CT in established and emerging image-guided procedures. The review presents typical configurations and room layouts for Angio-CT systems and discusses further technological improvement potential. Selected literature is complemented by expert experience to report on the current state of the art and demonstrate its use and efficiency. Based on our expert experience, it is demonstrated how DICI-CT can be used to reduce contrast dose and improve lesion visualization, targeting, and endpoint determination. Furthermore, in this review the advantages, including survival benefit (i.e., in trans-arterial chemoembolization and in blunt trauma) and cost-effectiveness (i.e., in emergency care), are reviewed with reference to oncologic and non-oncologic applications in both elective and emergency medicine. Hybrid Angio-CT suites can provide significant additional imaging information with the potential to improve image-guided procedures. This perspective is increasingly supported by retrospective data in interventional oncology and beyond. Provided that further technological advancements are achieved and prospective clinical data substantiates the anticipated clinical and economical benefits, hybrid Angio-CT suites are anticipated to play a key role in the multimodality interventional suite of the future."

    "abstract": "Thoracic blunt injuries are not uncommon, and they can cause severe cardiac and major vascular damage, leading to high mortality. Blunt cardiac rupture and traumatic aortic dissection are the primary fatal outcomes of these injuries. Many patients do not survive long enough to reach the hospital, and even those who present to emergency departments face challenges in timely diagnosis and management. This narrative review was conducted in accordance with the core principles of the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. A literature search was performed to summarize current evidence on blunt cardiac rupture and traumatic aortic dissection in thoracic blunt trauma settings. Early recognition of life-threatening complications from thoracic blunt trauma is essential for prompt and accurate diagnosis as well as appropriate clinical interventions. Cardiac rupture and traumatic aortic dissection from thoracic blunt trauma have traditionally been considered distinct entities, exhibiting different injury mechanisms and clinical outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the etiology, injury mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of fatal cardiac rupture and aortic dissection resulting from thoracic blunt trauma. The review is limited by the scarcity of high-quality studies and the predominance of case reports, but it highlights critical patterns in diagnosis and management that may inform clinical practice and guide future research. Overall, the findings underscore that improved understanding and awareness of these conditions can facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment, ultimately reducing mortality and improving patient care in real-world clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) has traditionally been seen as a non-survivable event. Advances in prehospital resuscitation have improved outcomes, and current guidelines emphasize addressing reversible causes of TCA, namely hypovolemia, hypoxemia, tension pneumothorax and tamponade. Understanding data on the causes and outcomes of TCA in a dense urban area may help improve treatment and prevention. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who experienced a prehospital TCA in Geneva from January 1st, 2008, to December 31st, 2022. Data was extracted from the databases of the prehospital physician-led emergency service (SMUR) and the forensic medicine service. During the 15-year period, a total of 673 TCA cases were identified, of which 464 (68.9%) patients were managed by the SMUR. The average age was 52 ± 22 years, with 72.1% of males. In 90.5% of cases, the TCA occurred before the arrival of the SMUR, although emergency response times were short (8.7 min ± 4.4). 216 (46.5%) patients underwent resuscitation. Of these patients, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in 71 (32.9%) and 62 patients (28.7%) survived to hospital admission. 8 patients (6 blunt, 2 penetrating) were alive at 30 days (3.7%). Pediatric TCA (< 18 years old) was rare, representing only 21 (3.1%) cases. Between 2008 and 2022, over 44 TCA cases per year were recorded in Geneva. Despite rapid emergency response times and ROSC achieved in more than one-third of patients who underwent resuscitation efforts, survival at 30 days was low. Factors associated with ROSC were crystalloid administration, timing of TCA, mechanism of injury, initial rhythm and the presence of an upper airway obstruction. This data underscores the need for the development and implementation of targeted interventions to enhance clinical outcomes and reduce preventable deaths within this specific patient population. This trial was approved by the regional research ethics committee, the Commission Cantonale d'Ethique de la Recherche sur l'être humain (CCER). (Project-ID: 2023 - 00767)."

    "abstract": "Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder characterised by arterial fragility, predisposing patients to life-threatening vascular complications. Endovascular aneurysm management in these individuals poses significant challenges due to their delicate vasculature and limited surgical options. This case report highlights the novel use of a direct percutaneous transhepatic approach for aneurysm coiling in a patient with a rapidly expanding hepatic artery aneurysm, demonstrating an innovative solution to a complex vascular emergency. A 17-year-old male with a known diagnosis of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome presented with a perforated sigmoid colon. After undergoing a midline exploratory laparotomy, imaging revealed a rapidly expanding 50-mm aneurysm in his common hepatic artery. Traditional endovascular coiling was infeasible due to significant proximal stenosis, creating similar limitations for vascular reconstruction and liver transplantation. The multidisciplinary team opted for a direct transhepatic approach to coil the aneurysm. The patient recovered without complications, and follow-up imaging confirmed haemodynamic stability and adequate liver perfusion. This case highlights the importance of an integrative multidisciplinary approach in managing complex vascular emergencies and successfully demonstrates how a direct percutaneous transhepatic approach can serve as a valuable reference for similar cases, expanding the repertoire of endovascular interventional radiology techniques for challenging pathologies."

    "abstract": "Current emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) guidelines do not distinguish between extrathoracic injuries. We hypothesized EDT is not associated with lower odds of mortality in pulseless penetrating neck trauma patients. We used Trauma Quality Improvement Project data, 2017-2021, including pulseless adults (≥16 y) with isolated penetrating neck trauma, proceeding to operating room (OR) or dying in the emergency department. The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were survival to OR and transfusion requirement. There were 262 patients. Of these, 110 (42.0%) injuries were gunshot wounds. A total of 30/262 patients (11.5%) underwent EDT. All 30 (100%) died in the hospital, while 9/232 (3.9%) non-EDT patients survived (P = 0.27). All 9 survivors had suffered stab wounds. Of the EDT patients, 7/30 (23.3%) survived to OR, whereas 24/232 (10.3%) survived to OR without EDT (P = 0.04). EDT may facilitate survival to operation in penetrating neck trauma, but is not associated with improved mortality. This may be due to the unique positioning of injuries proximal to aortic cross-clamp."

    "title": "Sociodemographic profile and injury characteristics of interpersonal violence: An emergency department perspective from Western India.",
    "abstract": "Interpersonal violence (IPV) is a broad term that includes all types of physical assault, involving the use of physical force or power against others by an individual or small group. Due to regional differences in resources, laws, and access to weapons, various patterns of violence and their associated risk factors are present worldwide. This study aims to examine the socio-demographic profile and injury characteristics of IPV cases presented at a tertiary care hospital in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. An observational study was conducted among victims of IPV who reported to the trauma and emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Rajasthan, India. A total of 243 cases were included in the study. Sociodemographic details of the individuals involved in IPV were collected, and various variables were defined according to the standard definitions of the Indian law and forensic literature. Among 243 cases of IPV, 189 (77.8 %) involved males, and 54 (22.2 %) involved females. The average age of victims was 32 years ±12.3 years. A total of 87 victims (35.8 %) were classified as illiterate. The face was the most frequently affected area among all victims, accounting for 152 cases (23.3 % of the total body parts involved). About 8.1 % of victims had consumed alcohol or other substances at the time of the incident. 161 victims (66.2 %) reported experiencing physical assaults by individuals known to them. Among males, simple injuries were common, occurring in 145 cases (76.7 %), and the most common weapon used by perpetrators was a blunt weapon, involved in 157 cases (83.1 %). Among female victims as well, simple injuries were more frequent, seen in 48 cases (88.9 %), and the most were attacked with a blunt instrument, used in 49 cases (90.7 %). Univariate analysis showed that males had 1.281 (1.116-1.471) times higher odds of lacerations, 1.289 (1.204-1.379) times higher odds of stab wounds, 1.161 (1.017-1.324) times higher odds of being assaulted with a dangerous weapon, and 1.183 (1.028-1.363) times higher odds of alcohol or substance use at the time of the incident than females in IPV. In this study, the young males tend to be the most common victims of IPV. These individuals are often subjected to attacks in outdoor settings during nighttime. Perpetrators more commonly used blunt weapons. Lacerations were the most common injuries. In two-thirds of the cases, the perpetrators were known to the victims. In more than one-tenth of the incidents, the victims had consumed alcohol at the time of the incident. Collaboration among multiple stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, law enforcement, community organizations, and policymakers, is necessary for a coordinated and comprehensive response to complex social and criminal issues, such as IPV."

    "abstract": "Trauma patients are a high volume and morbidity population, showing the importance of their prehospital care. This study aimed to evaluate the current status and consistency of prehospital trauma triage protocols in the United States. States with statewide emergency medical services (EMS) protocols and trauma triage criteria were included. For each state, EMS protocols were analyzed to assess trauma centers and categories, trauma triage criteria (including physiologic, anatomic, mechanism, and patient factors), and transport mode and destination guidance. Of 31 states with statewide EMS protocols, 29 (94%) included prehospital trauma triage criteria. States most commonly had two (15 (52%) states) or four (nine (31%) states) trauma categories identified with colors, numbers, or letters. Systolic blood pressure (29 (100%) states), Glasgow Coma Scale (15 (52%) states), and respiratory rate (29 (100%) states) were the most frequently used physiologic criteria. Anatomic criteria included central penetrating trauma (29 (100%) states), bilateral femur fractures (26 (90%) states), open skull fractures (25 (86%) states), bilateral extremity paralysis (28 (97%) states), amputation above the wrist/ankle (28 (97%) states), unstable pelvic fracture (27 (93%) states), and flail chest (27 (93%) states). Death from the same mechanism (27 (93%) states), ejection (28 (96%) states), or pedestrian/bike versus automobile (29 (100%)) were mechanistic criteria for motor vehicle accidents. Patient factors, including age, anticoagulation, and pregnancy were patient factors used as trauma criteria. Destination differed by trauma category in 22 (76%) states, and helicopter transport was advised for drive times exceeding thresholds ranging from ten to sixty minutes. In this national study of EMS protocols, we found heterogeneity in the structure and indications used for prehospital trauma triage criteria. This study highlights the need for standardization to ensure trauma patients receive timely and appropriate care."

    "abstract": "The pericardium is a membrane that envelopes the heart and the proximal great vessels. In normal physiological conditions, there is approximately 10-50 ml of pericardial fluid. However, accumulation of pericardial fluid can occur due to inflammation or infection of the pericardium and adjacent structures. This may be an asymptomatic and incidental finding following imaging for another disease process, or the patient may present in shock due to cardiac tamponade. It is important to note that it is the rate of accumulation, not absolute size, that primarily determines symptoms. Whilst the clinical suspicion may be raised by the history, examination, electrocardiogram, or chest X-ray, the echocardiogram is the mainstay of diagnosis. Options for treatment will depend on the cause and haemodynamic consequences. This article will consider the aetiology, pathophysiology, investigations and management of pericardial effusions."

The patients presenting with these injuries, practice guidelines, and use early of interventions including angioembolization (AE), exploratory laparotomy (EL), and preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP) have changed over time. It is not known if these changes are associated with mortality. Adults presenting with an open pelvis fracture between 2017 and 2022 were retrospectively identified from the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality identified by \"deceased\" or \"expired\" emergency department or hospital discharge disposition. Patient-level adjusted risk of mortality was calculated by multivariable logistic regression considering patient comorbid conditions, injury characteristics, interventions, and facility characteristics across observed years. Adjusted mortality risk relative to AE, EL, and PPP interventions was assessed per year by Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Of 10,172 eligible patients identified, 81.44% were male. The mean adjusted mortality was 10.78% and significantly decreased by 0.43% per year (p = 0.001). AE was performed for 4.42% of patients and did not significantly change per year. EL was performed for 8.03% of patients and decreased by 0.60%/year (p < 0.001). PPP was performed for 7.56% of patients and increased by 0.76%/year (p < 0.001). Trauma centers of mid-tier size (400-600 beds) reported increasing admissions of open pelvis fractures. In-hospital mortality after open pelvis fracture declined 2017-2022 as practice patterns evolved for the acute management of associated hypotension, including increased use of PPP and decreased use of EL.

    "abstract": "Car seat belts are safety devices that protect passengers during collisions in traffic accidents. However, seat belts can cause abdominal injuries during collisions. Many cases of injury to various intraperitoneal organs caused by seat belts have been reported, but reports of duodenal injury are relatively rare. In addition, diagnosing duodenal injury due to blunt trauma is not easy, and it is not uncommon for cases to be diagnosed long after injury. Here, we report a case in which a patient was diagnosed with perforation of the 4th portion of the duodenum 2 days after injury in a traffic accident. A 67-year-old woman was transported to our hospital after driving a car that collided with a wall. A seat belt mark was observed on her abdomen. A CT scan performed on the day of the injury confirmed a small poorly enhanced area in the duodenum, but no obvious signs of intestinal perforation were found. CT scan also revealed abdominal aortic dissection, a right clavicle fracture, and bilateral rib fractures. Two days later, a CT scan revealed expansion of the poorly enhanced area of the intestinal wall and a small amount of free air in the 4th portion of the duodenum. As duodenal perforation was suspected, emergency surgery was performed. Laparoscopic surgery was performed, and a quarter-circumferential perforation was found in the 4th portion of the duodenum. The perforation was closed with barbed sutures. The patient began oral intake of fluids on POD 7. The abdominal aortic dissection improved with conservative treatment, and the patient was discharged on POD 60 without any postoperative complications. We report a case of duodenal injury and abdominal aortic dissection caused by a seat belt during a collision. The reason may be that the seat belt moved toward the upper abdomen during the collision, causing compression of the abdominal organs between the seat belt and the spine. Considering the possibility of delayed duodenal perforation, it is important to perform a CT scan again and select an appropriate treatment according to the situation."

    "abstract": "Negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE) is a potentially fatal perioperative condition that requires increased awareness. This narrative review highlights the underrecognized aspects of the condition and analyzes the risk factors, diagnosis, management, and prevention of NPPE in the current literature. NPPE most frequently develops in the post-extubation period. It is a non-cardiogenic and non-fluid-overload pulmonary edema that occurs due to the generation of high negative pressure against a closed glottis, hence also termed obstructive pulmonary edema. NPPE is potentially lethal and requires intensive care therapy. Risk factors for developing NPPE include young age, male sex, and upper airway surgery or obstruction. Clinical manifestations include pink frothy sputum and respiratory distress. Chest X-ray and ultrasound reveal diffuse infiltrates and increased B-lines, respectively. NPPE should be differentiated from cardiogenic pulmonary edema, tension pneumothorax, aspiration pneumonia, and fluid overload by history and monitoring. Milder cases of NPPE improve with oxygen therapy and the use of non-invasive ventilation to maintain airway patency. Severe NPPE cases require intubation and invasive ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure. β-agonist therapy may help by accelerating alveolar fluid clearance. Severe cases of NPPE with persistent hypoxia may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Preventive measures include suctioning of endotracheal secretions before extubation, limiting the number of laryngoscopy attempts, considering deep or awake extubation, and the use of lidocaine."

    "abstract": "Angiomyolipoma (AML) of the small bowel is a rare entity. It usually presents with intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or intussusception. However, sometimes it may have an unusual presentation, posing intraoperative challenges. Here we report an unusual presentation of this rare disease. A 32-year-old male presented to the emergency department following an abandoned irreducible right inguinal hernia repair at a peripheral hospital. The patient had a transected segment of small bowel extruding from the incision site, sutured to the skin margin. On assessment, a 6x2 cm mass was discovered arising from the transected segment of the extruding bowel. After a formal exploratory laparotomy, a segment of small bowel, including the mass and transected bowel, was resected and brought out as a double-barrel ileostomy in the right iliac fossa. The right inguinal hernia was repaired with Bassini's herniorrhaphy. Histopathological examination confirmed the mass lesion as an AML. This case underlines the necessity of a comprehensive preoperative assessment and knowledge of uncommon intra-abdominal pathology. Proper diagnosis and surgical planning are required to prevent intraoperative complications and enable total excision, thereby minimizing the chance of recurrence."

We conducted a retrospective study of 1,867 patients aged more than or equal to 18 years, who presented with trauma-related complaints, underwent brain CT, and had residual samples collected less than or equal to 24 hours postinjury. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of GFAP and UCH-L1 using the Abbott i-STAT TBI Plasma test. Additionally, we assessed diagnostic accuracy within key clinical subgroups to define a proposed implementation cohort and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers within this cohort. Among 1,867 patients, 49 (2.6%) had clinically significant traumatic intracranial lesions. Elevated GFAP or UCH-L1 demonstrated 96% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 86% to 99%), 30% specificity (95% CI 28% to 32%), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.47), and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.13 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.53). Two patients had clinically significant CT lesions without elevated GFAP or UCH-L1. In the proposed implementation cohort of adults aged more than or equal to 18 years without coagulopathy elevated GFAP or UCH-L1 had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 86% to 100%), specificity of 33% (95% CI 31% to 36%), LR+ of 1.50 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.56), and LR- of 0.00 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.95). Plasma GFAP and UCH-L1 in combination, measured ≤24 hours postinjury, demonstrated high sensitivity for clinically significant acute traumatic intracranial lesions. Further research is needed to determine whether deploying these biomarkers in the proposed implementation cohort decreases avoidable brain CT scans."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Necrotizing soft tissue infections, known as NSTIs, are well known for being acute, aggressive, and rapidly progressive and can cause systemic sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and multi-organ failure. Clinical presentation varies from tense edematous skin to blisters and necrosis. The correlation between necrotizing fasciitis and cesarean section has been reported to be 1.8 per 1000 women, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood. CASE REPORT We present a case of a 28-year-old woman who underwent emergency cesarean section and presented 1 week later with septic shock and profuse foul-smelling wound discharge. IV antibiotic therapy began with meropenem, vancomycin, and clindamycin for suspected necrotizing fasciitis. Upon exploration, we found complete uterine dehiscence, necrotizing fasciitis of the anterior lower abdominal wall, and cutaneous fistulation. Emergency hysterectomy, extensive wound debridement, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) were performed. Tissue culture revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis. Multiple VAC dressing changes and debridement of the abdominal wall were performed. The histopathology results confirmed a diagnosis of acute suppurative endometritis with bilateral acute salpingitis. The patient was discharged 22 days after exploratory laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS Endomyometritis can lead to severe complications, including uterine dehiscence, with infection rapidly spreading along fascial planes and into subcutaneous tissue, ultimately resulting in necrotizing fasciitis, which is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Management in this case required extensive surgical debridement and emergency postpartum hysterectomy, in addition to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. This case of an uncommon yet life-threatening complication strongly reinforces the critical importance of early diagnosis and prompt management of postpartum endometritis to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality."

We examined agreement between best practice advisory recommendations, PECARN risk categories, and head CT use, as well as risk factors associated with deviation from PECARN guidance. Group comparisons were analyzed by Mann-Whitney rank-sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Fisher exact test, or χ2 test, as indicated. Best practice advisory and PECARN agreement was 47%. The best practice advisory aligned with CT use in 39% of cases, whereas PECARN aligned 73%. In children <2 years, 42% received a head CT despite a PECARN recommendation against it (P < .001). In children ≥2 years, 38% received a head CT against PECARN recommendations (P < .001). Overall agreement among best practice advisory, PECARN, and head CT use was 35%. Symptoms such as speech changes, lethargy, altered mood, and gait abnormalities were associated with deviations from PECARN. Findings suggest that although PECARN guides imaging decisions, numerous clinical factors and best practice advisory recommendations influence provider behavior, highlighting opportunities to improve decision support and reduce unnecessary CT scans."

    "abstract": "Emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) is a high-risk, salvage procedure performed during the resuscitation of critically injured patients who are in extremis or experience cardiac arrest immediately before or after arrival at the emergency department (ED) following trauma. Despite its potential to improve outcomes in selected patients, its indications and ideal clinical applications remain controversial due to significant risks of morbidity and mortality. In Saudi Arabia, trauma is responsible for approximately 20% of fatalities and is the leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years lost among males. However, there is limited research on EDT outcomes in this region. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary academic trauma center in Riyadh with dedicated trauma and surgical services. Medical records from 2015 to 2023 were reviewed to identify adult patients who underwent EDT, using trauma team activations as a screening criterion. Data collected included demographics, mechanisms of injury, procedure indications, and timing. During the study period, the center averaged 151 trauma activations per year, identifying 11 patients who underwent EDT. All were male, with a mean age of 35.64 ± 8.89 years. Blunt trauma was the cause in 64.6% of cases. Of these, 45.4% met the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guideline recommendations for EDT, while 18.2% had contraindications. Traumatic arrest in the ED or prehospital settings was the most common indication 72.7%. Mean time between ED arrival to procedure initiation was 25.45 ± 15.85 min. One patient survived to discharge. Among 45 traumatic arrests screened, 4.44% lacked documentation for withholding EDT despite conditional guideline recommendations. Given the limited data available on EDT in the MENA region, our study offers important perspectives from a high-volume trauma center in KSA, where the rate of EDT was found to be very low. This low rate is likely due to the predominant injury patterns observed, presenting few candidates who might benefit from the procedure. At the same time, most patients who may have benefited based on guideline recommendations did undergo the procedure. These findings emphasize the need for heightened clinician awareness and systematic decision-making regarding EDT in trauma care. To enhance the generalizability of our findings and assess EDT's utility in regional settings, further research involving larger multicenter registries is necessary in the country and the region."

This study describes the computed tomography (CT) location of PTX detected after an initial negative prehospital EFAST. Trauma patients treated by New South Wales Ambulance (Aeromedical Operations) who underwent prehospital EFAST between 1st August 2022 and 31st December 2023 were included if they were found to have PTX on CT imaging following a negative or indeterminate prehospital EFAST ultrasound. Patients were excluded if prehospital pleural decompression was undertaken. Corresponding CT imaging was manually analysed for the location of each PTX and mapped to two-dimensional coordinates on an unfurled thoracic cage. Of 58 patients median (IQR) age was 29 (20, 58) years. The majority (76 %) were male who had sustained blunt trauma. The median (IQR) estimated PTX volume was 8 % (4-10) with 43 % of patients having a pneumothorax located to either the second intercostal space or most anterior portion of the chest on CT-mapping. The midpoints of each locule were anatomically distributed with a median (IQR) of 4th (3rd-5th) intercostal space and distance from the sternal edge (cm) of 4.1 (2.5-5.1) on the right, and 4.4 (3.5-5.2) on the left. Most PTX were sonographically occult due to apical, retrosternal, or posterior position. Most traumatic PTX missed by prehospital EFAST were truly sonographically occult, but a significant number corresponded with the traditional scanning landmarks, particularly the parasternal 4th intercostal space. This reinforces current literature advocating this scanning region. The balance between optimal detection and sono-paralysis should be considered for ongoing education and governance."

We present the case of a 26-year-old female with a history of chronic alcohol use and a recent hospitalization for acute pancreatitis, who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed necrotizing pancreatitis (Balthazar D) and a splenic collection. Following signs of hemodynamic instability and a critical drop in haemoglobin levels, an urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed. Splenic complications in the context of acute or chronic pancreatitis are uncommon. A high index of clinical suspicion combined with early diagnosis through CT scan or other imaging modalities is crucial to improving prognosis. Given the potential for rapid deterioration, prompt and appropriate intervention can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with splenic rupture. Spontaneous splenic rupture should be suspected in patients with acute pancreatitis who develop hemodynamic instability.Computed tomography scan is essential for early detection and assessment of splenic complications.Prompt surgical management can significantly improve outcomes in unstable patients."

Management typically centers on fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and treatment of precipitating factors, but clinicians must remain alert to rare and life-threatening complications. We report a 28-year-old male with no prior history of diabetes who presented with influenza-associated DKA. Despite standard therapy, he developed worsening shock and persistent abdominal tenderness. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed portal venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis, prompting emergent laparotomy. Intraoperative findings confirmed extensive ischemic necrosis of the terminal ileum, right colon, and appendix, requiring resection with temporary abdominal closure. A second-look procedure 48 hours later demonstrated viable remaining bowel, and an ileo-transverse anastomosis with definitive closure was performed. The patient improved steadily, was extubated, and discharged home in stable condition. This case highlights the need for vigilance when abdominal pain or hemodynamic instability persists in DKA patients despite appropriate management. Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), although rare and more often described in older individuals with vascular risk factors, can occur in young adults in the setting of profound hypovolemia and shock. Early recognition, aggressive fluid resuscitation, careful titration of vasopressors, and timely surgical intervention are critical to improving outcomes and preventing mortality in these patients."

Data were collected from institutional trauma registry and nonregistry data repository for patients ≥65 y presenting directly to a level I trauma center with blunt trauma, preguideline, and post guideline revision. The repository encompasses activation patients with no injuries or minor injuries who are discharged home from the ED or admitted for noninjury related reasons. Trauma team activation rates, resource utilization, and outcomes were examined. After revision, trauma registry (prerevision: 295 versus post revision: 915 patients) and nonregistry (prerevision: 132 versus post revision: 1703 patients) activations markedly increased. The most common activation criterion post revision was elderly fall on antithrombotic (prerevision: 34.9% versus post revision: 69.6%). Activated registry patients had significantly lower median Injury Severity Scores (prerevision: 10 versus post revision: 5) and mortality rates (prerevision: 8.1% versus post revision: 4.3%), with higher emergency department to home discharge rates (prerevision: 10.2% versus post revision: 28.9%) post guideline revision. Activations were associated with prerevision: 4.5-fold and post revision: 4.0-fold faster time to index computed tomography scan completion than nonactivations. Activations markedly increased post guideline revision with many patients having no injuries or minor injuries that did not meet registry inclusion criteria. The increased activations were largely associated with elderly falls on antithrombotics. Among those meeting criteria, the Injury Severity Score was low, and they were more frequently discharged home from the ED. An opportunity for optimizing resource utilization may exist."

    "abstract": "Vaginal dehiscence with evisceration is a surgical emergency where all cases are surgically managed. However, identifying the optimal approach in a patient with a history of prior chemoradiation and multiple native-tissue pelvic reconstructive surgical procedures may be challenging. We present here a multidisciplinary case of a 74-year-old patient where flap and graft material placement were utilized as part of her management. She presented as a transfer from an outside hospital for vaginal evisceration of small bowel contents. She was hemodynamically stable, and physical examination revealed 14 cm of edematous, nonreducible, hyperemic bowel protruding beyond her introitus. General surgery and plastic surgery services were consulted for multidisciplinary management. She underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy with an oblique rectus abdominus flap (performed by plastic surgery), small bowel resection and right hemicolectomy (by general surgery), and closure of the distal posterior vaginal wall dehiscence site with placement of a saline-reconstituted decellularized fish skin xenograft within the vaginal defect (by urogynecology). Her postoperative course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged home on postoperative day (POD) 11. She was recovered and asymptomatic at her 4-week postoperative follow-up visit, where she declined scheduling further follow-up appointments. In conclusion, vaginal incision dehiscence with evisceration is best approached early on in a multidisciplinary manner. Select patients, such as those with an extensive pelvic surgical history, multiple vulnerable vaginal incision lines, and history of recurrent prolapse may benefit from consideration of flap placement and application of graft material for wound healing and surgical site integrity at the time of repair."

    "abstract": "Right ventricular perforation by pacemaker leads is often reported. However, reports of delayed lead perforation, defined as the perforation that occurs >1 month after implantation, are rare. Despite the fact that delayed pacemaker lead perforation can be an emergency, no clear treatment strategy has been defined. Herein, we report our experience with a case of delayed lead-associated perforation causing cardiac tamponade. A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency room with chest and back pain and dyspnea. He had undergone pacemaker implantation for advanced atrioventricular block eight years ago. He was found to have cardiac tamponade due to right ventricular lead-associated perforation. Emergency surgery was performed to drain the fluid and control the bleeding via a median sternotomy. The lead screw had perforated a vein on the cardiac surface. The perforating lead was retained because the threshold and impedance of the lead were unchanged. Only the perforation was repaired. After seven days, the ventricular lead threshold increased. This was managed by adjusting the pacemaker settings. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged home. The treatment of right ventricular lead-associated perforation generally entails removal and reinsertion of the lead. However, in our patient, a definitive diagnosis could not be made before the operation because the right ventricle was not completely perforated by the lead tip. Furthermore, the patient had concomitant cardiac tamponade with signs of shock. Therefore, open surgery was performed. After the perforation site is repaired, the area around the myocardium may deteriorate for several reasons (e.g., edema, fibrosis, and partial myocardial tissue necrosis). Therefore, if the pacemaker lead cannot be removed (or reinserted), as in our patient, measures such as insertion or implantation of a temporary pacemaker lead need to be taken in anticipation of deterioration of the myocardium around the retained lead."

    "title": "Management of Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest with Hemoperitoneum from LUCAS Device: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Witnessed hypothermic cardiac arrest is a rare injury with high mortality, particularly at extreme temperatures. We describe a case of witnessed accidental hypothermia with a profoundly low core temperature of 20°C, resulting in pre-hospital cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully treated with cardiopulmonary bypass rewarming, but the clinical course was further complicated by a liver injury from device-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), necessitating exploratory laparotomy. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old man was found roadside in -15°C weather and suffered pre-hospital cardiac arrest, witnessed by emergency medical personnel. Rewarming treatment with cardiopulmonary bypass was performed at our level-1 trauma center after the patient presented with a core temperature of 20°C and underwent 195 minutes of CPR. Intraoperatively, he was noted to have constant loss of volume on bypass as well as a tense, distended abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy was performed showing hemoperitoneum from a liver laceration secondary to CPR with a Lund University Cardiopulmonary Assist System (LUCAS) device. Delayed sternal and abdominal closure was performed with definitive closure occurring on hospital day 3. The patient experienced full neurologic recovery and was discharged home on hospital day 23. CONCLUSIONS Extracorporeal rewarming is a definitive treatment for cardiac arrest from accidental severe hypothermia and can be accomplished with cardiopulmonary bypass. Providers should have heightened clinical suspicion for solid organ injury when CPR is facilitated by a LUCAS device rather than manual compressions. Disproportionately low return volumes on the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit should prompt consideration of a differential diagnosis which in post-resuscitation patients can include traumatic hemoperitoneum."

    "abstract": "Tension pneumothorax(TP) is defined as a pneumothorax in which the pressure of intrapleural air exceeds atmospheric pressure, producing adverse effects, including contralateral mediastinal shift associated with cardiovascular collapse, due to reduced venous return (because of compression of the SVC and IVC) and hypoxia. Usually, patients with TP present to the Emergency Department with vague pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, but being considered a red flag it should be diagnosed during the primary assessment and managed promptly with large bore needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion. Presence of extensive subcutaneous emphysema(SCE) can further aggravate the respiratory distress and make the airway management even more challenging in the ER. Situation can become even worse when such a patient needs cardiopulmonary resuscitation on arrival. We report an unusual case of a 55 years old man, who presented in the ER with history of sudden onset respiratory distress while taking bath. Patient was brought to the ER in a state of gasping, hypoxia and shock. Needle decompression of the pneumothoraces was not sufficient as he also had extensive subcutaneous emphysema which resulted in cardiac arrest. The CPR and the airway management extremely were practically difficult. He was finally tracheostomised in the ER and accompanied by bilateral chest-tube thoracotomy. He was discharged for home after pleurodesis without any neurological deficit. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is an uncommon condition but can rarely end up in tension pneumothorax and accompanying subcutaneous emphysema can make the management further challenging. Airway skills of the ER team are important in saving such patients ives."

    "title": "Delayed Diagnosis of Hirschsprung Disease in an 18-Year-Old Male Patient With Fecaloma and Colonic Perforation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder most commonly diagnosed in the neonatal period or early childhood, typically due to failure to pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life. However, diagnosis may also occur later in adolescence or adulthood in patients with longstanding significant constipation, often leading to delayed recognition and the development of serious complications. We report the case of an 18-year-old male patient with a longstanding history of chronic constipation since infancy, who presented to the emergency department with progressive abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and failure to pass stools. Physical examination revealed severe fecal impaction, and imaging studies demonstrated generalized colonic dilation without evidence of free air. Laboratory findings included hyponatremia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and evidence of acute decompensation with tissue hypoperfusion. Initial conservative management with intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement, and enemas provided only partial improvement, and due to progressive deterioration, an urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed megacolon with spontaneous perforation of the descending colon and a large fecaloma. A subtotal colectomy with colostomy was carried out. The diagnosis of short-segment Hirschsprung disease was confirmed histopathologically by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. The postoperative course was favorable, and intestinal transit was later restored in a staged surgical approach. This case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in adolescents with chronic constipation, particularly in the presence of metabolic compromise or acute abdominal complications, as timely surgical intervention can be lifesaving in the context of perforation."

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TOHCA) is consistently associated with poor survival outcomes. Although the prehospital interventions may influence prognosis. This study aimed to identify independent prehospital factors associated with survival to hospital admission among patients of blunt TOHCA in Thailand. This retrospective cohort study used nationwide data from the Information Technology of Emergency Medical System database between 2012 and 2022. Patients of all ages with blunt TOHCA who received prehospital resuscitation and were transported to the emergency department were included. The primary outcome was survival to hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify associated prehospital factors. Of 18,612 patients with blunt TOHCA, 3,004 (16.1 %) survived to hospital admission. The survival rate declined from 28 % in 2012 to 13 % in 2022. Several independent factors associated with improved survival, including external bleeding control (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.20, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.40), endotracheal intubation (aOR 2.12, 95 % CI: 1.74-2.58), intravenous fluid administration (aOR 1.65, 95 % CI: 1.32-2.06), defibrillation (aOR 2.40, 95 % CI: 1.99-2.90), longer on-scene time (aOR 1.03, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.03), and head/neck injuries (aOR 1.30, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.51). In contrast, longer hospital-to-scene distances, chest/clavicle injuries, and open/closed fractures were associated with decreased odds of survival. This study highlights critical challenges in the prehospital management of blunt TOHCA in Thailand. Timely and appropriate interventions, including bleeding control, airway management, intravenous fluid administration, and defibrillation, may enhance survival outcomes."

    "abstract": "An 11-year-old spayed female terrier mix dog weighing 6.38 kg was presented to the emergency department of a large specialty hospital for hyporexia and lethargy. The dog was diagnosed with a perforated duodenal mass. On exploratory laparotomy, a perforated mass along the duodenal flexure was identified, an intestinal resection and anastomosis was performed, and a nasogastric tube was placed. Two days after surgery, the dog erroneously received 16 mL of a commercially formulated liquid diet through a triple-lumen jugular catheter. When the medical error was detected, 4 mL of diet and blood was aspirated from the jugular catheter. The catheter tip and a sample of the diet were submitted for culture. Culture results of the catheter revealed no growth, but the food grew methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. At 5 d following the inadvertent administration, the dog was discharged on clindamycin 11 mg/kg, q12h and cefpodoxime 7.5 mg/kg, PO, q12h for 10 d. Histopathology of small intestinal mass was consistent with large cell lymphoma. The dog was re-evaluated 2 wk following surgery and was doing well. Key clinical message: Inadvertent intravenous administration of enteral feed is a serious medical error; however, this case report serves to describe a successful outcome.

    "abstract": "Hemopericardium, the accumulation of blood within the pericardial sac, can lead to fatal cardiac tamponade if untreated. Its subtle presentation often obscures classic tamponade signs, complicating timely diagnosis. Essential thrombocythemia (ET), a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm, predisposes patients to both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. While aspirin is effective in reducing thrombotic risks associated with ET, it can also precipitate life-threatening bleeding, such as hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade. A 71-year-old hemodialysis-dependent woman with ET experienced worsening dyspnea and chest tightness 1 month after starting dual antiplatelet therapy. This therapy was initiated immediately following a percutaneous coronary intervention for an acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Computed tomography revealed a massive pericardial effusion, and echocardiography confirmed cardiac tamponade. Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis yielded hemorrhagic fluid, establishing the diagnosis of hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis resolved the effusion, but recurrent non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions and in-stent restenosis necessitated repeated balloon angioplasty. Discontinuation of aspirin and the addition of cilostazol to clopidogrel failed to prevent further complications. The patient later developed pulse ventricular tachycardia in the emergency department, and after her family declined cardioversion, she died. This case exemplifies the complex challenges of managing thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks in ET patients with cardiovascular disease and renal impairment, highlighting the necessity for tailored therapeutic strategies and further research."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular condition that can result in sudden death. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and thanatological features of sudden deaths due to aortic dissection. We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of autopsy-confirmed cases over a 12-year period (2011-2023). Aortic dissection accounted for 3.28 % of all sudden deaths. The mean age of the deceased was 54.7 years (range: 19-82 years), with a male predominance (sex ratio M/F = 9). Hypertension was identified in 37.5 % of cases, and Marfan syndrome in 10 %, all in individuals under 40 years of age. Chest pain was reported in 25 % of cases, while discomfort was the most frequent symptom (30 %). The ascending aorta was involved in 60 % of cases. Cardiac tamponade was the most common cause of death (62.5 %), mainly related to type A dissections (92 %). The events occurred predominantly in the morning. In 48 % of cases, individuals were found deceased at home. Sudden death due to aortic dissection occurs most often without prior diagnosis and affects a relatively young, predominantly male population. Autopsy findings provide crucial data to improve early detection and emergency management of this fatal condition."

    "title": "Balloon Pericardiotomy: A Comprehensive Review and Case Series.",
    "abstract": "Pericardial effusions can occur owing to a variety of reasons such as trauma, infection, autoimmune disease, and malignancy. Cardiac tamponade depends on the rate of fluid accumulation and not solely on the volume of the pericardial effusion. Rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid can lead to impaired cardiac filling and output with hemodynamic consequences, requiring urgent or emergent intervention. Despite initial intervention on patients with cardiac tamponade, recurrence of pericardial effusions has been estimated at approximately 20%, with a mean interval to recurrence of approximately 1 month. Both interventional and surgical techniques have been developed to relieve excess pericardial fluid including pericardiocentesis, surgical pericardiotomy, and percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy (PBP) with the latter 2 generally reserved for recurrent effusions. Rarely, surgical pericardiectomy is pursued. While safety and outcomes data are readily available for both pericardiocentesis and surgical pericardiotomies, PBPs are performed less frequently and at the few medical centers with the necessary expertise. In this case series, we present our center's experience with PBP in the management of recurrent pericardial effusions in 4 different patients. We highlight their comorbidities and corresponding high surgical risk as well as review the technical considerations and outcomes of each patient. Aside from a small pneumothorax managed conservatively, there were no adverse side effects encountered. Balloon pericardiotomy is a safe and effective modality for pericardial effusion drainage in high-risk patients, which can improve patient comfort and hemodynamics."

    "abstract": "A 54-year-old woman visited our hospital due to abdominal pain after a fall. Computed tomography (CT) showed abdominal distention, massive ascites, and membranous structures of unknown origin, but no mass lesions in the abdomen. Blood tests showed increases in CRP to 31 mg/dL, CA19-9 to 2100 U/mL, and CA125 to 10020 U/mL. Ascitic fluid analysis showed no malignant cells, an increased cell count, and an elevated adenosine deaminase level of 174 U/L. Positron emission tomography showed no avid accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the abdomen. We, therefore, drained the ascites for symptom relief, which unintentionally resulted in marked decreases in CA19-9 and CA125 to 221 U/mL and 1802 U/mL, respectively. Thereafter, an exploratory laparotomy showed a large amount of dirty ascites, abscess, fibrin clots, and no ovarian tumors. A cell block analysis of the ascites taken during the operation showed positivity of CK7, ER, and PAX8 and negativity of CK20 and CDX-2, leading to the diagnosis of a possible uterine or ovarian tumor. The second operation, six weeks after the exploratory laparotomy, showed multiple peritoneal implant-like lesions and a large ovarian tumor with a capsule, which released massive fluid of 6.6 L due to the capsule rupture during the operative procedures. Postoperative pathological study showed that the ovarian tumor was a unilocular cystic tumor with no solid components, had partially thickened cyst walls with hyalinization, and scant presumed invasion of atypical cells in a tubular fashion, finally making the diagnosis of ovarian serous borderline tumor (SBT). The patient recovered uneventfully and has been well without any recurrence for two years. Emergency physicians should note that ovarian SBTs can rupture even with minor trauma and cause underdiagnosis due to the lack of evident solid parts in the tumor."

This study aims to determine clinical characteristics and assess trauma scores in predicting positive WBCT findings in emergency trauma patients. This prospective observational study was conducted at a level I trauma center. Patients over the age of 18 who presented to the emergency department due to high-energy trauma and were indicated for WBCT were included. Demographic characteristics, injury mechanisms, vital signs, physical examination findings, and trauma scores (Injury Severity Score (ISS), Triage Revised Trauma Score (T-RTS), Circulation, Respiration, Abdomen, Motor, and Speech (CRAMS) score of the patients were recorded. The study included 1363 patients. 75.7% (n = 1032) of the patients were male, with a mean age of 36 years. 36.8% (n = 502) of patients had a positive (+) WBCT. Falls > 5 meters (p = 0.002) and injury to more than 2 body regions (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with a higher rate of (+) WBCT in trauma patients. Patients with (+) WBCT had statistically significantly higher mean pulse rate (p = 0.001), respiratory rate (p < 0.001), and shock index (p = 0.007), while the mean oxygen saturation was lower (p < 0.001). The CRAMS score demonstrated higher predictive power than the T-RTS (AUC: 0.618; 95% CI: 0.586-0.650; p < 0.001; cutoff: 7.5) for identifying the presence of CT findings. In multitrauma patients, the indication for WBCT should be determined not only based on trauma mechanism but also by considering physical examination findings, vital signs, and trauma scores collectively."

    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Blunt trauma injury of the diaphragm is uncommon. Even after imaging examination, accurate diagnosis remains difficult. We sought to identify clinical factors that raise suspicion of such injuries, which can be applied during the initial evaluation of trauma patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with blunt trauma who were diagnosed with diaphragmatic injury between January 2015 and July 2025. Demographic variables, clinical findings, operative records, and imaging findings were reviewed. Results: The most common mechanism of injury in patients with diaphragmatic injury was traffic accidents (64.2%), and 77.4% were identified as severe injuries with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16. Computed tomography (CT) scans of these patients frequently showed hemothorax, hemoperitoneum, and pneumothorax, but 49.1% of cases did not show diaphragmatic injury on preoperative imaging. In these patients, pneumothorax, lower rib fractures, and liver injury were more common. Notably, pneumothorax strongly suggested the possibility of diaphragmatic injury in patients where intrathoracic herniation was not clear. Conclusions: In patients with polytrauma and unstable vital signs, CT evaluation of torso injuries and careful interpretation are essential. Even when CT does not reveal diaphragmatic injury, suspicion should be elevated in cases with high ISS accompanied by pneumothorax, hemoperitoneum, hemothorax, lower rib fractures, or extremity injuries. If the injury mechanism further raises clinical suspicion, repeated physical examinations and imaging studies should be performed. When suspicion remains high, surgical intervention should be considered to confirm the diagnosis."

Although abdominal computed tomography (CT) did not confirm MVT, persistent clinical suspicion and the presence of metabolic acidosis prompted an exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, extensive intestinal ischemia was identified, and given the patient's hemodynamic instability, damage control surgery was performed, including resection of necrotic bowel, temporary stoma formation, and temporary abdominal closure using the \"sandwich\" technique. After stabilization in the ICU, a second-look operation allowed for jejunocolic anastomosis, stoma reversal, and definitive abdominal closure. A postoperative venous-phase CT scan confirmed MVT.

We developed and evaluated a physical training model that simulates cardiac tamponade and allows for practice of the pericardial window procedure. The model was constructed using layered anatomical structures and simulated blood to replicate tamponade physiology. Emergency physicians and surgeons performed pericardiotomy using the model, after which a structured survey was conducted to assess its realism, educational value, and the participants' confidence in performing the procedure. Eight emergency or trauma physicians completed the procedure using the model and responded to the survey. The median participant age was 42 years, and three had no prior operative experience. The model received high ratings for both realism and educational value (median Likert score: 4). This simulation model provides a realistic, reproducible, and portable platform for training in rare, high-acuity procedures without the need for live patients.

Patients were included if they were ≥18 years old and underwent emergent nontraumatic laparotomy. Or primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included the usage of DCL, complications, intensive care unit admission, postoperative ventilation, and hospital length of stay.ResultsA total of 1249 patients were included with 745 (59.6%) direct admissions and 504 (40.4%) transfers. Transferred patients had higher PESAS scores (5 vs 3, P < 0.0001) and ASA classifications (ASA 4: 31% vs 22%, P = 0.0004). They also had higher rates of DCL (52% vs 42%, P = 0.0008), ICU admissions (52% vs 40%, P < 0.0001), and increased ventilation in transfers (47% vs 37%, P = 0.0004). While overall complications were higher in transferred patients (50% vs 39%, P = 0.0002), mortality rates were not significantly different (18% vs 14%, P = 0.1479).ConclusionsTransferred EGS patients presented with greater preoperative severity and required DCL at higher rates. Transferred patients had increased complications, ICU, and ventilation needs. They also had an increase in complications however no difference in mortality. This suggests that while transferred patients are at increased preoperative acuity effective transfer systems and utilization of DCL may mitigate mortality risk in these patients."

    "abstract": "Purulent pericarditis is a rare but severe presentation of acute pericarditis that can rapidly progress to effusive-constrictive pericarditis (ECP), a syndrome characterized by concomitant cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis. A 62-year-old woman with diabetes presented with chills, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain. Despite initial treatment for idiopathic acute pericarditis, she rapidly developed cardiac tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis yielded purulent fluid consistent with Streptococcus pneumoniae pericarditis, and postdrainage echocardiogram demonstrated constrictive physiology, supporting a diagnosis of ECP. The patient subsequently underwent partial pericardiectomy, with marked clinical improvement. This case highlights the rapid progression of nontuberculous purulent pericarditis to ECP and underscores the importance of serial echocardiography in diagnosing, monitoring, and managing ECP. ECP is a rare but under-recognized complication of purulent pericarditis, requiring a high clinical suspicion. Given the diagnostic challenges, early recognition, close monitoring, and timely intervention are critical to improving outcomes."

    "title": "A Case of a Perforated Duodenal Ulcer in the Context of Acute Tubular Necrosis and Urosepsis.",
    "abstract": "Duodenal ulcer perforation is a life-threatening complication of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), often manifesting with acute abdominal symptoms. However, PUD itself can be asymptomatic, potentially delaying diagnosis, particularly in individuals without recognized pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions. While Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are well-established primary risk factors for PUD, the condition can also develop in the absence of these common triggers or due to other less apparent causes. This report details the case of an 80-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 3A and a recent complicated urinary tract infection (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli) who presented with confusion and increased urinary frequency. His initial evaluation revealed acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to severe dehydration and metabolic acidosis, which then progressed to urosepsis and ischemic acute tubular necrosis. Unexpectedly, during his hospital admission, he developed a sudden anterior duodenal ulcer perforation. His condition was managed successfully with an emergency exploratory laparotomy and surgical repair, followed by postoperative hemodialysis, leading to a full recovery without complications from the ulcer repair. As this patient lacked typical PUD risk factors, the ulcer was likely idiopathic in origin, with its acute presentation likely exacerbated by AKI-associated uremia, metabolic acidosis, and the physiological stress of his critical illness. This case underscores the importance of recognizing stress-related risk factors for peptic ulcer formation in critically ill patients with AKI, as prophylactic measures recommended to prevent stress ulcer bleeding may also help reduce the risk of life-threatening complications such as perforation."

    "abstract": "Large hiatal hernias are typically managed conservatively; however, in rare instances, they can lead to life-threatening mechanical cardiovascular complications through direct extrinsic compression of the cardiac chambers rather than pericardial fluid accumulation, producing \"functional\" tamponade physiology. An 88-year-old man presented to the emergency department with sudden worsening of a three-day history of chest and upper abdominal pain radiating to the back. On arrival, he was vomiting, dyspneic, pale, and hypotensive (blood pressure: 96/52 mmHg). A CT angiogram revealed a massive hiatal hernia containing the stomach and transverse colon, complicated by gastric volvulus and anterior cardiac compression consistent with tamponade physiology. Nasogastric decompression was unsuccessful due to distorted anatomy. The patient subsequently underwent an urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) within one hour of CT acquisition, which aspirated 1.1 L of thick gastric contents, leading to the resolution of the cardiac compression. OGD was chosen over immediate surgical intervention due to the patient's frailty and comorbidities, with the aim of rapid decompression and minimizing the perioperative risk. He made a full recovery and was discharged shortly thereafter, remaining symptom-free at the three-month follow-up. This case highlights a rare but critical complication of massive hiatal hernia causing functional cardiac tamponade. Prompt recognition through CT imaging and timely endoscopic decompression can be life-saving."

    "abstract": "Testicular rupture caused by blunt scrotal trauma can be repaired routinely, but for severe testicular rupture often accompanied by a large area of tunica albuginea defect, it is impossible to suture the tunica albuginea without tension unless excess normal testicular tissue is removed. This case report highlights the surgical challenge of using a pedicled tunica vaginalis in the case of severe tunica albuginea defect in testicular rupture. Two underage boys both experienced severe pain in the scrotum due to trauma, and ultrasound examination showed testicular rupture. Emergency surgical exploration was performed, and severe testicular rupture was observed during the operation, with a large area of tunica albuginea defect that could not be repaired routinely. After trimming the necrotic testicular tissue, a pedicled testicular sheath was sutured to the residual tunica albuginea. After one year of postoperative follow-up, the recovery was good and hormone levels were normal. Surgical repair of testicular rupture presents certain challenges, especially for severe tunica albuginea defects. The use of a pedicled testicular tunica vaginalis can more easily solve this problem, but the location and size of the tunica vaginalis need to be designed during surgery, especially to ensure blood supply to the tunica vaginalis. For severe testicular rupture, the use of pedicle testicular sheath repair is a recommended option, but it requires certain surgical techniques."

We present an unusual case of an 8-month-old infant with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), tracheostomy, and gastrostomy-tube dependence, with radiographic evidence of pneumatosis intestinalis and free intraperitoneal air. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed which identified air within the mesentery of the small and large intestine, without evidence of true pneumatosis, perforation, inflammation, or ischemia. The patient recovered from their surgery uneventfully without any complications.

A 26-year-old male presented with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain and vomiting. He had a similar episode seven years prior that self-resolved. Physical examination revealed generalized abdominal tenderness, guarding, and mild distention. Imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasound and CECT, confirmed midgut volvulus due to nonrotation. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and Ladd's procedure, leading to an uneventful recovery and discharge on postoperative day seven. A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted for case reports on midgut nonrotation in adults. 15 relevant cases were selected, and including the present case, 16 cases were reviewed. The mean age at presentation was 55.19 years (range: 26-86), with a slight male predominance (56.2%). The most common symptoms were acute abdominal pain (50%) and vomiting (31.25%). Notably, 50% of cases were identified incidentally during evaluations for unrelated conditions or procedures. CT scans confirmed diagnoses in 87.5% of cases. Positional anomalies included right-sided small bowel and left-sided colon in 37.5% and reversed SMA/SMV relationships in 33%. Ladd's procedure was performed in 25% of cases. Midgut nonrotation, resulting from abnormal embryonic bowel rotation, can occur at any age, more commonly in males. It may present as a surgical emergency due to bowel obstruction and volvulus or remain asymptomatic throughout life. CT imaging and surgical intervention, particularly Ladd's procedure, are effective management strategies. The frequent incidental discovery of cases suggests that asymptomatic nonrotation may be more prevalent than clinically recognized."

    "abstract": "The optimal site for needle decompression in tension pneumothorax patients with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 remains debated. This study aimed to identify the most suitable site-second intercostal space at the midclavicular line (2nd ICS in the MCL) or fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line (5th ICS in the MAL)-by comparing skin-to-pleura distances using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Skin-to-pleura distance measurements at the right 2nd ICS-MCL and the right 5th ICS in the MAL, assessed by three different operators. The primary outcome was to compare the skin-to-pleura distances at the 2nd ICS in the MCL and the 5th ICS in the MAL using POCUS in volunteers with a BMI over 30. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the consistency of different operators in determining the most appropriate site for needle decompression in the management of tension pneumothorax among healthy volunteers with a BMI over 30, using bedside ultrasonography. A total of ninety-one volunteers were enrolled. The skin-to-pleura distance at the 5th ICS in the MAL was found to be statistically significantly greater than that at the 2nd ICS in the MCL in the measurements performed by each operator (Operator 1: p = 0.016; Operator 2: p = 0.002; Operator 3: p = 0.006). The MCL measurements obtained by all three operators demonstrated statistically significant agreement. In obese patients, the 2nd ICS-MCL may be considered the preferred site for needle decompression. Nevertheless, individualized assessment of both sites using bedside ultrasonography is recommended to optimize procedural success and reduce complications."

    "title": "Emergency Surgery Score as a Predictor of Post-operative Outcomes in Non-traumatic Emergency Laparotomy: A Prospective Observational Study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Most patients with acute abdominal conditions present with a unique set of problems because of acute physiological derangements, lack of optimization, and associated comorbidities. Emergency laparotomy in such patients is quite a morbid procedure. Predicting the surgical outcome and taking measures in advance to improve patient outcomes following emergency laparotomy is of utmost importance. Simultaneously, it can also help in preoperative counseling and shared decision-making for patient management. This study was designed to investigate the potential use of Emergency Surgery Score (ESS) in predicting outcomes among non-traumatic emergency laparotomy cases. Material and methods This prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of General Surgery at a Tertiary Care Centre in India. All patients above 18 years of age undergoing nontraumatic emergency laparotomy were included in the study. All variables related to the three broad categories of ESS were recorded. Each ESS variable was scored accordingly, except for the variable \"White race,\" which was scored zero by default. Surgical outcome was recorded in terms of length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, 30-day mortality rate, 30-day postoperative complications, and 30-day readmission. Results A total of 163 patients were included in this study. All the variables related to the ESS and surgical outcomes were recorded and analyzed. ESS correlated positively with the length of hospital and ICU stay among the survivors (rho=0.51 and rho=0.53, respectively). For a one-unit rise in ESS, the length of hospital stay and the length of ICU stay increased by 1.8 days and 0.71 days, respectively. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, the ESS demonstrated a strong correlation with both the 30-day mortality rate and 30-day complications (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) values of 0.895 and 0.875, respectively). Conclusion Our study's findings underscore the potential of ESS as a powerful predictor of postoperative outcomes in emergency laparotomies. By providing an objective measure for outcome comparison, ESS can significantly enhance preoperative patient counseling and decision-making."

    "abstract": "Ovarian tumors are quite uncommon in the premenarchal age group, with the majority being functional cysts. Malignant tumors are unusual in this age group, making the diagnosis of ovarian malignancy in children quite challenging. Dysgerminoma is the most common malignant ovarian germ cell tumor in females. The clinical symptoms often include abdominal pain, distension, a palpable mass, reduced appetite, nausea, and vomiting. We discuss the case of an 11-year-old premenarchal girl who was brought to the emergency department with abdominal pain persisting for 3-4 days, which had intensified over the 24 hours before she arrived at the emergency department. The pain was accompanied by vomiting. On examination, her lower abdomen showed tenderness, guarding, and rigidity, and a firm mass approximately 10 x 8 cm in size was palpable in the midline. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a large hypoechoic mass lesion, approximately 99 x 56 x 92 mm, in the right adnexa. A magnetic resonance imaging with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis was performed for confirmation, which substantiated the diagnosis of the right ovarian lesion with torsion. Following the patient's exploratory laparotomy, a right salpingo-oophorectomy and left oophoropexy were performed. The histopathological report confirmed the diagnosis of dysgerminoma. Malignant ovarian tumors are quite rare in the premenarchal age group, and the primary goal should be to offer fertility-preserving surgeries. This allows the individual to retain reproductive functions. However, close monitoring is essential, and if needed, radical surgery should be considered to save the patient's life."

In response, the government declared a state of internal armed conflict and a \"state of emergency\" This study aims to analyze the impact of this political measure on the admission of patients who are victims of violence to a hospital in the coastal region of the country. This is an analytical cross-sectional study conducted over nine months, from October 2023 to July 2024, divided into three-month periods. The independent variable was the period of surgical trauma: pre-exception, during the state of exception, and post-exception. The dependent variable was surgical trauma due to violence. A bivariate analysis was performed and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study included 160 cases of surgical trauma. Of the traumas reported during the nine months, 80 % (N=128) were due to violence. 78 % (N=125) of patients underwent surgery for penetrating trauma, with 77 % (96/125) of these due to firearms. The proportion of penetrating injuries due to firearms varied significantly according to period (p = 0.020). During the state of exception it fell to 60 % (21/35) from 79 % (31/39) pre-exception, but rose again in the post-exception period to 86 % (44/51). The strategies implemented did not significantly reduce trauma admissions due to violence at this hospital, underscoring the imperative for additional interventions and a comprehensive understanding of the social determinants underlying this public health issue."

We report a case of a 37‑year‑old man with no prior comorbidities and a four‑year history of chronic methamphetamine use who presented with diffuse abdominal pain of 10 days' duration, fever, and incipient shock. Plain abdominal radiography demonstrated massive colonic distention. As computed tomography was unavailable and signs of peritoneal irritation were present, urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing patchy transmural necrosis of the entire colon with viable small bowel. Total colectomy and ileostomy were undertaken. Despite intensive vasopressor support, the patient died of refractory vasoplegic shock. This case underscores that NOMI secondary to methamphetamine use can occur in young patients and rapidly progress to massive colonic necrosis. It also highlights the need to maintain a high index of suspicion and proceed to early surgical exploration when the clinical scenario warrants it, even in settings with limited diagnostic resources, to avoid fatal delays."

Current guidelines recommend needle decompression (ND) as the initial decompression procedure. The metric of successful decompression is for operators to use \"a gush of air\" and monitor changes in vital signs. Effective needle decompression for tension pneumothorax in the prehospital environment is challenging. Studies report consistently a high failure rate of decompression. We hypothesize treatment of tension pneumothorax with needle decompression incorporating colorimetric indication as the initial decompression modality may improve initial decompression success rates and lower the need for additional decompression procedures such as finger thoracostomy. Prospective enrollment of trauma patients before and after deployment of Colorimetric Assisted Needle Decompression (CAND). Patients who underwent needle decompression in a prehospital setting were included. Eligible patients received either ND, or CAND. The primary endpoint of this study was clinical success rate of initial decompression. Secondary outcomes included the number of repeat decompression procedures performed and decompression type: ND, CAND, or finger thoracostomy. 30 patients underwent ND and 11 patients underwent CAND. There were no statistically significant differences in patients age, sex, or trauma type. Performing ND without CAND resulted in an overall initial decompression success rate of 66 % compared to 82 % when using CAND. There was an overall reduction in need for repeat needle decompression 9 % vs 17 % and conversion to finger thoracostomy, also 9 % and 17 % when using CAND. Initial decompression utilizing colorimetric detection of CO2 improves initial procedural success, with demonstrably less need for repeat procedures or conversion to finger thoracostomy for treatment of tension pneumothorax. We recommend initial decompression utilizing needle decompression coupled with a colorimetric CO2 sensing device. Future guideline revisions should consider recommending initial needle decompression be coupled with CO2 colorimetry."

    "abstract": "Penetrating injury is a time-critical disease where early definitive treatment is lifesaving. Although most patients with penetrating trauma reach the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical services (EMS), self-presentation or transport with police are also common. This review synthesizes the available evidence in adult penetrating trauma to evaluate if the mode of transport to hospital impacts early mortality. Two groups were defined as follows: transport to hospital with emergency medical services (EMS) and 'other' transport (private or police). Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were searched as well as gray literature. Results were screened by two authors. Eligible studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias and included in both a meta-analysis using a random effects calculation of odds ratio and narrative analysis. 19 studies were included overall. Meta-analysis using data from nine studies showed EMS transport did not significantly impact early mortality (OR 1.32 [95% CI 0.70-2.48] (p = 0.39)). Overall injury-severity adjusted mortality was assessed using data from 14 studies and was also not significantly affected by EMS transport (OR 1.21 [95% CI 0.93-1.59] (p = 0.16)). Data comparing injury-to-hospital arrival times for medical and nonmedical transport were limited but suggested nonmedical transport was faster amongst an urban cohort of patients. There was no survival benefit associated with EMS transport among this largely USA-based urban cohort of patients with penetrating trauma. Shorter injury-to-hospital arrival times associated with nonmedical transport may, in some cases, outweigh the benefits of prehospital care. These findings support an emphasis on shortening the prehospital phase for severely injured penetrating trauma patients, which may include use of nonmedical transport where transport times are short."

Affected patients typically exhibit abrupt onset, rapid progression, and exceedingly high mortality. Early recognition and prompt intervention are pivotal in AFE management. We present a case of AFE-induced cardiac arrest in a 35-year-old primigravida who developed acute cardiopulmonary collapse during vaginal delivery, followed by cardiac arrest. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation, massive transfusion, and crash emergency cesarean section, anticoagulant-free venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was initiated. Subsequent multimodal therapies - including aggressive transfusion support, uterine artery embolization for hemostasis, exploratory laparotomy, and targeted DIC management - ensured safe ECMO maintenance without device-related complications. By hospital day 3, hemodynamic and respiratory stability were achieved, enabling successful ECMO weaning. This case highlights that ECMO remains a viable therapeutic option for salvaging critically ill AFE patients with refractory hemorrhagic shock, DIC, and cardiopulmonary failure."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a significant clinical concern, particularly among elderly and psychiatric patients, often leading to complications such as intestinal obstruction. In this article, we present an intriguing case of dual intestinal and urinary obstruction caused by the ingestion of a dental bridge in a patient with Bricker urinary diversion. Through this rare case, we aim to explore the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with such incidents, supported by a comprehensive review of the literature. A 52-year-old edentulous male with a history of bipolar disorder and a cystoprostatectomy with Bricker-type urinary diversion presented to the emergency department with a one-week history of subumbilical abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal bloating and anuria. Physical examination revealed fever (38.5 °C), abdominal distension, localized guarding in the right iliac fossa, and a non-functional urostomy. Laboratory investigations demonstrated significant inflammatory markers accompanied by acute renal insufficiency. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging identified a mechanical small bowel obstruction caused by impacted dense fecal material, with proximal bowel dilation leading to extrinsic compression of the Bricker conduit, which showed wall thickening. Following brief resuscitation, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, marked small bowel distension was observed (upstream of an intraluminal obstructive material) that was exerting extrinsic compression on the Bricker diversion loop. Catheterization of the Bricker loop decompressed the urinary system, while enterotomy allowed removal of a dental bridge. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. The ingestion of dental prostheses carries life-threatening risks (obstruction, perforation), particularly in elderly patients or those with surgical histories (e.g., Bricker diversion). CT scanning is the gold standard for diagnosis. Management may range from simple observation to endoscopic extraction (which proves challenging in cases of small bowel impaction) or emergency surgery when severe complications are present. Multidisciplinary prevention strategies (including prosthesis checks and radiopaque markers) are crucial for at-risk populations. The ingestion of foreign bodies, such as dentures, poses a significant risk of intestinal obstruction or perforation. Prompt diagnosis and immediate intervention are critical to ensuring favorable outcomes, particularly in vulnerable patient populations."

Failure to provide timely and accurate intervention significantly increases the risk of short-term mortality. We present the case of a 36-year-old male who was admitted to local hospital following a penetrating chest trauma. Relevant diagnostic evaluations revealed haemopneumothorax and shock. Following initial stabilization measures, the patient was urgently transferred to our institution due to haemopericardium, which was initially suspected to be secondary to traumatic aortic dissection. However, the admission electrocardiogram clearly demonstrated concurrent anterior and high lateral wall myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. We attempted interventional therapy on the LAD to restore blood flow. However, intraoperative findings revealed complete rupture of the LAD. The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The foreign body was successfully retrieved, and the CABG was completed without complications. The patient gradually recovered under short-term ECMO support and was discharged successfully. Follow-up assessments indicate a favourable recovery. The mechanism underlying traumatic myocardial infarction is complex and variable. Given that emergency physicians and cardiologists often lack extensive experience in such cases, they should exercise caution, conduct a thorough assessment, and meticulously plan each step of diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "We report a rare and serious case of intrapericardial malposition of a dialysis catheter in a 70-year-old patient with chronic kidney disease secondary to IgG kappa amyloidosis. The complication was initially revealed by an episode of supraventricular arrhythmia and confirmed through imaging studies. Catheter removal led to hemodynamic decompensation due to a compressive pericardial effusion, which required emergency sternotomy for drainage. The postoperative course was favorable. This case highlights the importance of thorough assessment of catheter placement and the need for prompt, multidisciplinary management in rare but potentially fatal complications of hemodialysis."

    "title": "The contemporary use of emergency pericardiocentesis in trauma: A nationwide trend analysis.",
    "abstract": "Pericardiocentesis is a critical skill taught by the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS®) course, yet substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding recent practice changes and indications for pericardiocentesis. This study aims to characterize contemporary practice patterns and nationwide trends in the use of emergency pericardiocentesis in trauma. A retrospective study of the National Trauma Data Bank (2011-2022) identified patients undergoing pericardiocentesis within 48 h of arrival prior to any cardiac repair surgery. The primary outcomes were pericardiocentesis timing and the proportion of patients with significant cardiac injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale 3, 5, or 6). Patient characteristics and clinical course were analyzed. Trend analysis was conducted using the Cochran-Armitage test. A total of 1036 patients were included; 59 % sustained blunt trauma, and 25 % were hypotensive on arrival. Median time to pericardiocentesis was 38 min [IQR: 19-74] for penetrating trauma and 78 min [IQR: 24-314] for blunt trauma. Following pericardiocentesis, 79 % of penetrating and 34 % of blunt trauma patients were taken to the operating room. From 2011 to 2022, there was a significant downward linear trend in the proportion of patients diagnosed with cardiac injuries in penetrating trauma (range: 55 % to 27 %; P for trend < 0.001), while blunt trauma cases showed no significant change (range: 15 % to 9 %; P for trend = 0.623). Emergent pericardiocentesis is used differently in penetrating and blunt trauma. The likelihood of identifying cardiac injuries has declined over time in penetrating trauma. In contrast, blunt trauma patients were more likely to undergo delayed pericardiocentesis, with fewer proceeding to surgery. These observed differences in timing and surgical progression may reflect evolving clinical practices and decision-making patterns in trauma care. This changing trend provides insight into evolving trauma care and highlights the contemporary role of pericardiocentesis in trauma."

    "title": "Perforated Meckel's diverticulum mimicking appendicitis in a 64-year-old male: a case report and comparative analysis from a resource-limited setting.",
    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, typically asymptomatic but occasionally presenting with complications such as bleeding, obstruction, or rarely, perforation. Symptomatic MD is unusual in the elderly, often mimicking other acute abdominal conditions and posing diagnostic challenges, especially in low-resource settings. We report a case of a 64-year-old male presenting with a 2-day history of right iliac fossa pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Clinical examination and laboratory findings were suggestive of perforated appendicitis. Due to the unavailability of CT imaging, an urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a perforated MD located 40 cm from the ileocecal valve. A wedge resection was conducted. Histopathological examination confirmed ischemic necrosis and ectopic gastric mucosa. The patient recovered smoothly and was discharged on postoperative Day 5. Perforation of MD is rare, particularly in elderly patients, and often leads to diagnostic confusion with more common causes of acute abdomen. In the absence of reliable imaging modalities, clinical acumen and timely surgical exploration are crucial. The presence of ectopic gastric mucosa within MD increases the risk of perforation. Surgical resection, tailored to intraoperative findings, remains the definitive treatment. This case underscores the need to consider MD in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, even in older adults. In resource-limited settings, prompt surgical intervention guided by clinical evaluation can be lifesaving and highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential to avoid missed or delayed diagnoses."

    "abstract": "Simultaneous presentation of acute appendicitis and ovarian torsion is rare and requires urgent surgical intervention due to the high risk of complications, including sepsis and mortality. While adnexal torsion is a known cause of acute abdomen in reproductive-age women, co-presentation with appendicitis is exceptionally uncommon. This case underlines the importance of considering gynecological differentials in women presenting with acute abdominal pain. A 39-year-old woman presented with right lower abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Initially diagnosed with an appendicular lump, she was managed conservatively and discharged after symptomatic improvement. Upon recurrence of symptoms, imaging revealed an ovarian dermoid cyst with torsion. Exploratory laparotomy identified a gangrenous ovary with a twisted cyst and adherent appendix. Histopathology confirmed acute appendicitis and a benign dermoid cyst. Adnexal torsion occurs when the ovary and fallopian tube twist around their ligaments, often caused by ovarian cysts like dermoid cysts. These cysts are common in young women and can lead to acute abdominal pain, requiring urgent surgery to prevent ovarian damage. Diagnosis is challenging, as symptoms mimic other conditions like appendicitis. Imaging such as ultrasonography or computed tomography is used, and treatment involves surgical untwisting or removal of affected tissues. Torsion sometimes affects nearby organs, like an appendix. This case highlights the rare occurrence of simultaneous appendicitis and ovarian torsion, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and surgical intervention."

Multi-institutional registry data report, January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023. Twenty-two Veterinary Trauma Centers (VTCs) identified and verified by ACVECC-VetCOT. Dogs and cats with evidence of traumatic injury presented to contributing hospitals. Data were input into a web-based data capture system (Research Electronic Data Capture) by data entry personnel. Patient data on demographics, trauma type, preadmission care, trauma severity assessment at presentation, key laboratory parameters, interventions, and outcome were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed for each species reported. Twenty-two VTCs in North America and the United Kingdom contributed data to the VetCOT registry between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023. A total of 9,820 cases (8,130 dog, 1,690 cat) were reported. The top three causes of trauma in dogs were penetrating bite wounds (35% of all dog trauma cases), vehicular strikes (17%), and lacerations (12%); in cats, unknown blunt trauma (22% of all cat trauma cases), penetrating bite wounds (20%), and falls from heights (14%) were the leading causes of trauma. Prevalence of trauma types across geographic regions was similar except for porcupine quilling, which occurred primarily in the Northeast of the United States. Vehicular trauma and porcupine quilling occurred commonly in rural VTCs, whereas falls from heights and nonpenetrating bite wounds occurred commonly in urban VTCs. Survival to discharge remained high in both dogs and cats (93.1% and 83.7%, respectively). The ACVECC-VetCOT registry provides a foundation for retrospective evaluation of traumatic injury in dogs and cats. It has already contributed to the production of numerous publications assessing relationships between demographics, trauma etiology, and trauma severity with clinical outcomes."

    "title": "Individualized Management of Traumatic Limb Pseudoaneurysms: A Case-Based Comparison of Endovascular and Open Repair.",
    "abstract": "Traumatic limb pseudoaneurysms are rare vascular complications that can cause acute limb ischemia and require urgent treatment. Traditionally addressed through open surgical repair, advances in endovascular techniques have introduced less invasive options, particularly beneficial for high-risk patients. This article presents two cases illustrating individualized decision-making in choosing between endovascular and open surgical repair. A comparative case-based approach was employed. The first case involved a 94-year-old male with multiple comorbidities and a femoral pseudoaneurysm following blunt trauma. Due to anesthetic risk, endovascular repair with overlapping stent grafts was performed. The second case described a 34-year-old male with a delayed presentation of a traumatic axillary artery pseudoaneurysm. Open surgical exploration and autologous vein graft interposition were undertaken. In the elderly patient, the endovascular approach achieved rapid exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm, with restoration of limb perfusion and no postoperative bleeding. In the younger patient, open surgery successfully re-established arterial continuity and function. Some residual sensory deficits persisted due to delayed presentation, but follow-up showed good perfusion and no signs of ischemia. These cases highlight the importance of patient-specific management. Endovascular repair offers a minimally invasive solution with lower perioperative risk, especially suitable for elderly or frail patients. Open surgery remains essential for durable reconstruction in young, otherwise healthy individuals or in anatomically complex cases. Selection of the optimal approach depends on age, comorbidities, pseudoaneurysm location, and time from injury to presentation. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms require individualized management strategies. Minimally invasive repair is generally reserved for patients at elevated surgical risk, whereas open repair remains a durable option for younger, healthier individuals. These cases reflect the need for flexible, evidence-informed decision-making in vascular trauma. With limited large-scale data and standardized protocols, further research is needed to guide optimal treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction is a common surgical emergency, but ileo-ileal knotting is an exceptionally rare cause in which two loops of ileum intertwine into a true knot, leading to strangulation. Preoperative diagnosis of ileo-ileal knotting is extremely challenging due to nonspecific clinical features, and most cases are identified only during emergency surgery. We present three cases of ileo-ileal knotting to illustrate varied precipitating factors, presentations, and diagnostic challenges associated with this condition. All patients underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy with resection of the knotted, nonviable bowel and primary anastomosis; each had an uneventful recovery and was discharged in good condition. Although rare, ileo-ileal knotting should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction, especially in rapidly deteriorating patients with signs of strangulation, since prompt surgical intervention is essential to prevent a fatal outcome."

This report describes a case of a 14-year-old male who sustained a gunshot wound to the anterior chest from a high-velocity pellet rifle, resulting in hemopericardium, cardiac tamponade, and potential injury to the right coronary artery. Following emergency surgery and the successful evacuation of a clot containing the pellet, the patient experienced ventricular fibrillation and was subsequently taken for percutaneous coronary intervention due to a middle right coronary arterial occlusion. Two drug-eluting stents were placed, restoring blood flow to distal vessels. Postoperatively, the patient was managed with antiplatelet therapy, including ticagrelor and aspirin. The case highlights the successful use of cardiac catheterization in a pediatric trauma patient and underscores the need for further research on optimal antiplatelet therapy in this population to prevent complications such as restenosis and stent thrombosis."

    "abstract": "Celiac trunk dissection is an extremely rare vascular injury in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma, accounting for less than 0.01 % of all trauma cases. Despite its rarity, this condition carries significant clinical relevance due to the celiac artery's role in perfusing vital upper abdominal organs. Clinical presentation varies widely, and diagnosis is often incidental during imaging for trauma evaluation. Management strategies range from conservative therapy to endovascular or surgical intervention, depending on the clinical context. We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department after being struck by a vehicle. She was hemodynamically stable and reported upper abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed an isolated dissection of the celiac trunk, with preserved distal perfusion and no associated organ injury or ischemia. The patient was managed conservatively with anticoagulation, blood pressure control, and close monitoring. Her condition remained stable, and she was discharged on antiplatelet therapy. Follow-up was uneventful. Celiac artery dissection following blunt trauma is a diagnostic challenge due to its variable and often subtle clinical presentation. A high index of suspicion and appropriate arterial-phase CT imaging are essential for timely diagnosis. Most stable patients without ischemic complications can be managed nonoperatively, provided adequate collateral circulation exists. Endovascular or surgical interventions are reserved for patients with flow-limiting lesions, pseudoaneurysms, or hemodynamic instability. Isolated celiac trunk dissection after blunt trauma is a rare but potentially serious condition. Early diagnosis, multidisciplinary evaluation, and individualized management are key to favorable outcomes. Conservative treatment is often effective in stable patients, while endovascular or surgical approaches should be considered in select cases with complications."

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed clustered dilated ileal loops with a transition point suggestive of internal herniation. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed a TOH through the greater omentum without bowel ischemia. The defect was divided, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Due to its nonspecific presentation and diagnostic difficulty, TOH is frequently identified only at surgery.

    "abstract": "We aimed to examine the procedural characteristics and safety profile of slender percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) using a 5 Fr or smaller sheath. Smaller catheter size has been associated with fewer complications in PCI. Our retrospective observational study included 259,401 cases of stable elective PCI from the Japan Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Registry between 2021 and 2022. Based on sheath size, cases were categorized into the slender group (5 Fr or smaller, n = 28,300) and the non-slender group (6 Fr or larger, n = 231,101). The slender group was associated with more radial access (88.6% vs. 74.2%: p < 0.001), fewer PCI failures (1.7% vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001), shorter procedural times (86.1 ± 47.2 min vs. 103.0 ± 65.1 min, p < 0.001), lower contrast medium usage (104.0 ± 54.8 mL vs. 126.0 ± 69.0 mL, p < 0.001), and shorter fluoroscopy times (25.9 ± 20.0 min vs. 32.4 ± 26.9 min, p < 0.001). Additionally, the slender group experienced fewer complications, including procedure-related myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] 1.25, p = 0.004), cardiac tamponade (OR 1.52, p = 0.048), heart failure or cardiogenic shock (OR 1.57, p < 0.001), stent thrombosis (OR 2.42, p = 0.02), emergency surgery (OR 3.45, p = 0.02), and bleeding complications at both the access (OR 3.16, p < 0.001) and non-access sites (OR 1.94, p = 0.02). Although the in-hospital mortality rate was slightly lower in the slender group, this difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.11, p = 0.39).

It is characterised by ketonaemia, acidosis, and normal serum glucose. Whilst guidelines advise withholding SGLT2i prior to elective surgery, limited guidance exists for emergency procedures. This systematic review aimed to describe EuDKA cases following emergency surgery, identify patient characteristics, and examine contributing risk factors. A search of electronic databases up to April 2024 identified 30 cases from 21 publications. In most cases, EuDKA onset occurred within three days postoperatively (range: intraoperative to 10 days). Reported risk factors included inadequate SGLT2i withholding time, poor glycaemic control, morbid obesity, major surgery, intercurrent illness, suboptimal intraoperative diabetes management, and delayed gastrointestinal absorption. Morbidity was significant: ten patients required intensive care, two required intubation and ventilation, two received dialysis, and one underwent exploratory laparotomy. No deaths were reported. Due to atypical biochemical findings and non-specific symptoms, EuDKA remains under-recognised. Clinicians are advised to maintain a high index of suspicion, ensure appropriate perioperative insulin management, conduct vigilant laboratory monitoring, and provide patient education to reduce the risk in emergency surgical settings."

    "title": "Acute purulent pericarditis secondary to community-acquired streptococcus pneumonia: A case report.",
    "abstract": "Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardial sac due to a variety of stimuli that ultimately trigger a stereotyped immune response. This condition accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in Western Europe and North America. The most common symptoms of clinical presentation are chest pain and shortness of breath with associated unique electrocardiographic changes. Acute pericarditis is generally self-limited. However, some cases may be complicated by either tamponade or a large pericardial effusion, which carries a significant risk of recurrence. Risk factors for acute pericarditis include viral infections, cardiac surgery, and autoimmune disorders. A rarer cause of pericardial inflammation includes pneumonia, which can induce purulent pericarditis that has been increasingly rare since the advent of antibiotics. Purulent pericarditis carries a high fatality rate, especially in the setting of tamponade, and is invariably deadly without the administration of antibiotics. Bedside transthoracic echocardiogram is a quick and helpful method that can aid in the diagnosis and management. We present the case of a 62-year-old woman who sought medical attention at the emergency department (ED) due to a 5-day history of chest pain, shortness of breath, and subjective fevers. Laboratory findings in the ED were significant for leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. A chest X-ray revealed a new focal density within the left lower lung base, and a bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed a pericardial fluid collection. The patient was subsequently admitted, where she underwent pericardiocentesis. Fluid cultures from drainage grew streptococcus pneumoniae. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately after the procedure. The patient was ultimately discharged in stable condition with cardiology and infectious disease follow-up. This case report emphasizes a unique complication of community-acquired pneumonia. Purulent pericarditis due to streptococcus pneumonia occurs via intrathoracic spread of the organism to the pericardium. This condition is virtually fatal without the administration of antibiotics. Therefore, in the context of suspected pneumonia and a new pericardial fluid collection on imaging, clinicians should suspect purulent pericarditis until proven otherwise, which requires emergent intervention."

    "title": "Barriers to Care Leading to Fatal Consequences: A Case of Tuberculosis Sepsis Amid Policy Change.",
    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacterium with a diverse range of clinical manifestations and is considered rare in Western countries. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern and can pose several challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Paired with changing immigration policies, immigrant populations can face several barriers to healthcare. This case illustrates the impact of immigration policy on clinical outcomes and how government policies can act as a barrier to care. We present a case of a 26-year-old Guatemalan man with no known past medical history who came to the emergency department hemodynamically unstable with the presentation of abdominal perforation. He was urgently taken for an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed two perforations in the terminal ileum, extensive fibrinous exudate in the peritoneal cavity, and significant lymphadenopathy in the mesentery and retroperitoneum. The specimens collected intraoperatively were sent for evaluation and showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with transmural necrosis, and mesenteric lymph node biopsy revealed necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, findings consistent with TB lymphadenitis. A sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) test further confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Given the concern for disseminated TB and ongoing ventilator and pressor support, this case required a multidisciplinary critical care course. The patient was started on antimycobacterial therapy with plans to transition to RIPE (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) therapy plus vitamin B6. The patients' hospital course was further complicated by loculated ascites with peritonitis and necrotizing pneumonia. Despite aggressive multidisciplinary medical therapy, the patient ultimately expired. The treatment of sepsis due to disseminated TB depends heavily on the ability to identify the causal infection, in addition to providing hemodynamic and organ support. The research stressing the timeliness of treatment and its impact on mortality in sepsis and miliary TB is well documented across medical literature. In this case, it is critical to analyze the political climate that may have prevented the patient from presenting to a healthcare provider when he first experienced symptoms."

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a common arrhythmia with significant implications and may occur pre-, intra-, or postoperatively (POAF). After cardiac surgery POAF occurs in approximately 30% of patients, while non-cardiac/non-thoracic surgery has a reported incidence between 0.4% to 15%, with new onset POAF occurring at a rate of 0.4% to 3%. While AF has been extensively studied, it has not been well described in emergent non-cardiac surgery associated with increased surgical stress in an intensive care unit setting (ICU). To investigate the incidence/predictors of POAF in emergent non-cardiac surgery and its associations with postoperative outcomes in the ICU. This retrospective study included patients ≥ 18 years who underwent exploratory laparotomy or lower extremity amputation between October 2012 and September 2023 and were admitted in the ICU. Data of interest included occurrence of POAF, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory values, administered fluids, medications, and postoperative outcomes. Statistical analyses consisted of identifying predictors of POAF and associations of POAF with outcomes of interest. A total of 347 ICU patients were included, 16.4% had a history of AF, 13.0% developed POAF, and 7.9% developed new-onset POAF. Patients with new-onset POAF were older (79.6 ± 9.1 vs 68.1 ± 14.8 years, < 0.001), of white race (47.8% vs 28.8, P < 0.001), hypertensive (87.0% vs 71.2%, P = 0.011), had longer ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS) (13.4 vs 6.7 days, P = 0.042), higher mortality (43.5% vs 17.6%, P = 0.016) and higher rate of cardiac arrest (34.8% vs 14.6%, P = 0.005) compared to patients without new-onset POAF. Multivariable analysis revealed increased POAF risk with advanced age (OR = 1.06; 95%CI: 1.02-1.10, P = 0.005), white race (OR = 2.85; 95%CI: 1.26-6.76, P = 0.014), high intraoperative fluid (OR > 1; 95%CI: 1.00-1.00, P = 0.018), and longer ICU-LOS (OR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.00-1.08, P = 0.023). After adjusting for demographics, new onset POAF significantly predicted mortality (OR = 3.07; 95%CI: 1.14-8.01, P = 0.022). POAF was associated with prolonged ICU-LOS, white race, and high intraoperative fluid. New-onset POAF was associated with increased risk of cardiac arrest and death in critically ill patients."

    "abstract": "Cervical spine injuries (CSIs) are the most frequently encountered spinal injuries resulting from blunt trauma, owing to the cervical region's anatomical vulnerability and high mobility. Early recognition and spinal motion restriction (SMR) are essential in preventing secondary spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly in pre-hospital settings. This literature review explores the comprehensive management of suspected CSIs from the pre-hospital setting to definitive care in the hospital. It highlights the importance of clinical suspicion based on the mechanism of injury, appropriate application of SMR, and the role of imaging modalities such as CT and MRI in diagnosis. Clinical decision tools, including the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) criteria and Canadian C-Spine Rules (CCR), are discussed in relation to reducing unnecessary imaging while maintaining patient safety. The review also addresses current debates around cervical collar use, the necessity of structured neurological assessments, and the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration. Classification systems such as the Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System (SLIC) and AO Spine Trauma Classification are evaluated for their role in guiding treatment decisions. Effective care for CSI requires timely intervention, accurate imaging, and coordination among emergency, radiology, intensive care, and spinal surgical teams to minimise neurological complications and improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Chylopericardium (CP), defined as the accumulation of chyle in the pericardial cavity, is a rare condition, especially in the absence of an identifiable secondary cause. Primary idiopathic chylopericardium (PIC) is even more uncommon, with limited cases reported in the literature. We report the case of a 43-year-old South Asian woman who presented with palpitations and fatigue. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade, necessitating emergent pericardiocentesis. The pericardial fluid aspirated was pinkish and turbid, which turned to milky white after centrifugation. Analysis of the pericardial fluid demonstrated a high triglyceride concentration, lymphocytic predominance, and fat globules, consistent with chylous effusion. A thorough diagnostic workup-including infectious, rheumatologic, and oncologic evaluations-was unrevealing, confirming a diagnosis of PIC. Lymphoscintigraphy was misleading in this case, with no thoracic duct abnormalities reported. Following an initial response to conservative management with pericardiocentesis and a medium-chain triglyceride-rich diet, the patient experienced recurrence of symptoms and fluid reaccumulation. Definitive management via thoracic duct ligation and pericardial window surgery was performed, resulting in complete resolution of the effusion. At 6-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence. This case highlights the importance of considering primary CP in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion. Absence of classical inflammatory signs and symptoms can be suggestive of chylous effusion. The report also supports surgical intervention as a definitive treatment even if lymphoscintigraphy does not reveal clear thoracic duct pathology."

    "abstract": "Type A aortic dissection (TAAD) complicated by cardiac tamponade represents a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. Acute pericardial effusion can severely compromise cardiac function. Although emergent surgical repair remains the gold standard, preoperative hemodynamic instability substantially increases surgical risk. Controlled pericardial drainage (CPD) has been proposed as a bridging intervention to rapidly relieve tamponade symptoms while mitigating the complications associated with excessive drainage. However, its clinical utility remains controversial because of concerns that the elevation in post-drainage blood pressure may accelerate dissection progression or trigger rupture. This case report highlights the successful use of CPD to stabilize a patient with TAAD and cardiac tamponade, facilitating a safe transition to definitive surgery. It also discusses the clinical utility of this strategy. A 48-year-old man presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of altered mental status lasting 50 min. Bedside ultrasound and aortic computed tomography angiography confirmed a TAAD diagnosis complicated by pericardial tamponade. After the examination, the patient experienced sudden hypotension, which was promptly managed with emergency CPD, resulting in rapid stabilization of blood pressure. Subsequently, the patient underwent \"Sun's procedure\" and artificial vascular replacement, during which 500 mL of pericardial blood was extracted. The patient recovered well and was discharged 24 days after the surgery. With rigorous hemodynamic monitoring and a multidisciplinary framework, CPD effectively functions as a preoperative stabilization approach in patients with TAAD complicated by pericardial tamponade, securing valuable time for subsequent surgical interventions."

    "abstract": "Pseudo-Meigs' syndrome is described as the triad of a pleural effusion, ascites, and pelvic or abdominal tumor that is not an ovarian fibroma or thecoma. To our knowledge, this is the first reported pediatric case of pseudo-Meigs' syndrome secondary to a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT). A 12-year-old female with a past medical history of asthma and obesity (body mass index of 37) presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, loss of appetite, irregular menses, and shortness of breath for one month. An abdominal ultrasound was obtained which showed a very large echoic heterogeneous structure involving the entire abdomen and moderate perihepatic and pelvic ascites. Computed Tomography (CT) imaging showed a large right pleural effusion with collapse of the right lower lobe, partial collapse of the right middle and upper lobes, and a 21.6 × 21.3 × 14.6 cm complex cystic mass in the abdomen. Tumor markers were significant for an elevated Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) of 1227 U/mL and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) of 2385 ng/mL. She subsequently underwent right pleural thoracentesis, right tube thoracostomy, exploratory-laparotomy, and left salpingo-oophorectomy. Surgical pathology was consistent with a poorly differentiated SLCT. SLCT are rare sex cord-stromal ovarian tumors that produce testosterone and account for less than 0.5 % of ovarian tumors. They are a rare cause of Psuedo-Meigs' syndrome. Pseudo-Meigs' syndrome secondary to a SLCT in an adolescent is an exceedingly rare diagnosis. Multidisciplinary care for these patients consisting of pediatric surgery, general pediatrics, and pediatric hematology/oncology services is critical for management."

    "abstract": "Pneumopericardium is relatively rare but potentially fatal in premature babies. When a massive pneumopericardium leads to cardiac tamponade, emergent pericardiocentesis is often required to save lives. In some cases, the placement of a pericardial drain for continuous drainage may be necessary. However, for very low birth weight or extremely low birth weight preterms, there is a lack of appropriately sized pericardial drain tubes, posing a clinical challenge. We report a case of a very low birth weight preterm baby, born at 1016 grams, who developed pneumopericardium. We successfully treated the pneumopericardium using a 22-gauge intravenous catheter."

    "abstract": "Pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when air enters the pleural cavity. There are numerous causes of pneumothorax, and healthcare providers must identify and treat the condition quickly to avoid elevated morbidity and mortality.  This report describes the case of an 87-year-old man with several comorbidities and a chronic tracheostomy on a ventilator who presented to the emergency department (ED) with bleeding at the tracheostomy site. Initial workup by otolaryngology (ENT) revealed hemostasis at the tracheostomy site and a retrocardiac opacity suspicious for pneumonia, so he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient was later noted to have oozing at the tracheostomy site and difficult ventilation, and a bronchoscopy revealed clots in the trachea. Ventilation became increasingly difficult, and the patient went into cardiopulmonary arrest, requiring chest compressions and defibrillation. After clot removal and spontaneous circulation was achieved, the patient continued to have persistent desaturations and was taken to the operating room (OR) by ENT for surgical exploration of the upper airway. During the surgery, two intraoperative chest X-rays (CXRs) taken 1.5 hours apart revealed a right pneumothorax. The surgeon opted to postpone chest tube insertion until after the procedure, and the pneumothorax was successfully decompressed in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) after the completion of the surgery. The patient returned to baseline health.  Our report demonstrates an uncommon case of pneumothorax discovered intraoperatively during emergent surgery. Pneumothoraces can cause rapid deterioration of hemodynamic stability and need to be identified quickly by providers. In the context of risk factors such as recent chest compressions, physicians should maintain high clinical suspicion for pneumothorax."

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing incidence of vertebral artery injury (VAI), it can often be overlooked during the management of polytrauma patients. Due to its specific anatomical location, the VA is particularly susceptible to both traumatic and spontaneous injuries. Traumatic VAI can result from blunt or penetrating trauma and is frequently associated with cervical spine injuries. An 18-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency department after being struck by a motor vehicle. The patient exhibited altered mental status while remaining normotensive and tachypneic. Notably, there were no visible injuries to the head or neck, though multiple contusions were present on the chest and abdomen. Radiographic imaging revealed a fracture of the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra, which caused dissection, thrombosis, and occlusion of the V1 segment of the left VA. Additionally, hypoplasia of the contralateral VA was observed. Given the presence of ultrasonographically confirmed free intra-abdominal fluid and the patient's newly developed hemodynamic instability, he was urgently transferred to the operating theatre. A grade 3 liver laceration was discovered, and hemostasis was successfully achieved using direct sutures. After regaining consciousness, the patient reported right-sided homonymous hemianopsia accompanied by signs of cerebral ischemia. Following stabilization, he was started on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. Upon discharge and during follow-up, the visual deficit persisted. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing and managing VAI in polytraumatized patients. Furthermore, the rare combination of contralateral VA hypoplasia and VAI significantly influenced the development of neurological deficits."

Methods: A retrospective chart analysis was performed. Trauma patients between the ages of 18 and 89 years receiving an emergent exploratory laparotomy on admission between January 1, 2015, and March 31, 2022, were included. A multivariable analysis was performed. The primary and secondary outcomes were the development of superficial SSI and wound dehiscence, respectively, on the basis of the type of incision closure. Results: Two hundred forty-seven patients who met our criteria were analyzed. Of these, 135 patients were closed with staples plus iNPWT, and 112 patients were closed with only staples. The multivariable analysis found decreased odds of superficial SSI in patients who received staples plus iNPWT versus staples alone (odds ratio [OR] = 0.28, p = 0.019). The multivariable analysis found decreased odds of wound dehiscence in patients who received staples plus iNPWT versus staples alone (OR = 0.24, p = 0.001). Conclusion: Our study revealed a statistically significant decreased odds of superficial SSI and wound dehiscence in patients who received staples plus iNPWT when compared with staples alone."

    "abstract": "Pediatric cervical spine injury (CSI) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) developed a CSI prediction rule for evaluating children after blunt trauma in the emergency department (ED). The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the PECARN CSI prediction rule using emergency medical services (EMS) clinician observations. We conducted a multicenter prospective observational study of children younger than 18 years with blunt trauma who were transported to one of 18 participating PECARN EDs by EMS. A convenience sample of EMS clinicians completed case report forms regarding CSI risk factors based on their clinical observations. We then evaluated rule performance with 95% confidence intervals (CI) by applying the PECARN prediction rule using the EMS clinical observations with the primary outcome of CSI. We also calculated rates of spinal motion restriction (SMR) had the algorithm been followed for the study population. Emergency medical services clinicians completed case report forms for 7,721 (57.4%) patients. Using these EMS cohort data, the PECARN CSI prediction rule had a sensitivity of 88.5% (95% CI, 82.9-94.2%), specificity of 63.1% (95% CI, 62.0-64.2%), positive predictive value of 3.7% (95% CI, 3.0-4.4%), and negative predictive value of 99.7% (95% CI, 99.6-99.9%). The proportion of children placed in SMR would have decreased from 41.5% to 37.7%, and longboard use would have decreased from 17.0% to 9.8% had the rule been applied to this cohort. The PECARN CSI prediction rule based on EMS clinician observations had good accuracy for CSI in children experiencing blunt trauma. Application of the prediction rule to our EMS patient population would have reduced both SMR and longboard use. Prognostic and Epidmiologic; Level III."

    "abstract": "Uterine torsion is a rare condition in dogs, typically associated with pregnancy or uterine pathology. A 5-year-old, female intact, Siberian-Husky presented with a history of lethargy and constipation for 3 days. Physical examination revealed pale mucous membranes and a firm, painful abdomen. Abdominal imaging revealed a thickened uterine body wall with an increased volume of mixed anechoic and heterogeneous echoic intrauterine content. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed the 360-degree torsion of the left uterine horn, and due to the extensive lesions ovariohysterectomy was deemed necessary. Postoperative clinical evaluation indicated ongoing signs of impaired oxygen delivery warranting hemotransfusion, following which progressive stabilization and complete clinical recovery was achieved. Histopathological examination showed diffuse uterine necrosis due to hypoxia from venous stasis, with inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. This report contributes to the limited veterinary literature on uterine torsion in non-pregnant bitches and underscores the importance of including it in the differential diagnosis, even in young patients or when other reproductive pathology is not evident, where a lack of predisposing factors may reduce clinical suspicion. It clearly illustrates how an acute reproductive emergency can abruptly and permanently preclude any future reproductive potential from an otherwise healthy animal."

    "abstract": "Midgut rotation is uncommon to present in adult age group and can be complicated by midgut volvulus. Our patient is 70-year-old male, who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and constipation for 4 days. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan (CT) was done and showed typical findings of midgut volvulus, which are inversion of the mesenteric vessels and whirlpool sign. Patient had an exploratory laparotomy in which adhesiolysis, Ladd's procedure and appendectomy were done. The patient had uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged after 6 days. Midgut malrotation results from failure of the midgut to rotate around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery. The presentation in adults are usually nonspecific and is low on the differential diagnosis, making enhanced abdominal CT the modality of choice. Midgut volvulus should be considered in cases of unexplained abdominal pain or bowel obstruction, even in adult age group. It requires emergent surgical intervention, so proceeding with urgent CT imaging is crucial."

    "abstract": "Coronary perforation during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a rare yet life-threatening complication, often necessitating emergent pericardiocentesis. However, rarely unexpected complications such as vascular injuries may arise, further complicating the clinical course. A 76-year-old lady with progressive angina underwent PCI for significant stenoses in the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) artery. The procedure was complicated by a coronary perforation in the mid-LAD, leading to cardiac tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis via the subxiphoid approach, guided by echocardiography, drained 300 mL of blood and temporarily stabilized the patient. A covered stent was deployed to seal the LAD perforation, but persistent bleeding suggested a secondary complication. Diagnostic evaluation, including analysis of the pericardial aspirate and repeat angiography, identified an arterial source of bleeding unrelated to the coronary perforation. Exploratory sternotomy revealed an aberrant superior epigastric artery injured during pericardiocentesis. Surgical ligation of the artery resulted in immediate hemodynamic improvement, and the patient was discharged in stable condition after a full recovery. This case highlights a rare vascular complication of pericardiocentesis, specifically an injury to the superior epigastric artery, exacerbated by anatomical variation. Such unreported injuries in the literature underscore the unpredictability of rare vascular complications even in typically safer techniques like the subxiphoid approach. A systematic, stepwise approach-combining imaging guidance, diagnostic evaluations, and prompt surgical intervention-is essential for timely management. Early recognition of vascular injury and swift multidisciplinary collaboration ensured a favorable outcome in this case, emphasizing the importance of vigilance and structured decision-making when complications arise."

This report presents the case of a 62-year-old patient with hypertension and anticoagulant use who arrived at the emergency department with abdominal and unusual chest pain. Initial imaging did not show signs of bleeding, delaying diagnosis until significant hemodynamic deterioration occurred, necessitating a damage control exploratory laparotomy to evacuate hemoperitoneum and ligate the middle colic artery. The double rupture phenomenon can complicate diagnosis, highlighting the importance of vigilance in patients with risk factors.

We report the case of a male neonate born at 33 weeks of gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 1,780 grams. The initial postnatal adaptation was satisfactory. However, on the second day of life, the infant developed sudden and severe abdominal distension associated with bilious vomiting and signs of respiratory distress. A plain abdominal radiograph revealed a massive pneumoperitoneum, highly suggestive of gastrointestinal perforation. The neonate underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a 2 cm linear perforation on the anterior wall of the stomach. The perforation was repaired primarily without the need for gastric resection. Despite early surgical intervention and aggressive postoperative management in a neonatal intensive care unit, the infant's condition deteriorated rapidly. He developed signs of sepsis, refractory shock, and multiorgan failure, and succumbed within 48 hours postoperatively. This case underscores the fulminant course and high mortality rate associated with SGP, especially in preterm neonates. It highlights the critical importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion in the presence of acute abdominal symptoms and radiologic findings, as early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are essential for improving outcomes in these vulnerable patients."

This study, with a special focus on sex differences, aimed to gain insights into the demographics, injury characteristics and outcomes of these patients and to provide data that could help improve prehospital trauma care. This is a retrospective multicentre cohort study analysing data collected by the Swiss Trauma Registry. Patients aged 16 or older, who were admitted by helicopter emergency medical services to a level 1 trauma centre in Switzerland between 2018 and 2022, with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of ≥16, were included. Overall, 2714 trauma patients were analysed in the present study. The majority of these patients were male (73.7%). Blunt trauma was the main cause of injury (93.6%), with traffic accidents (43.5%) and falls (43.3%) being the most common accident mechanisms. A greater percentage of male patients than female patients were involved in motorcycle crashes (16.5% vs 6.9%, p <0.001). Female patients were more frequently involved in accidents as pedestrians (6% vs 2.7%, p <0.001) and experienced more falls below 3 metres of height (22.9% vs 14.7%, p <0.001). The median ISS of our cohort was 24 (interquartile range [IQR]: 19-30). The most common injuries were thoracic trauma (67%), head trauma (66.7%) and spine trauma (50.3%). Men suffered more thoracic injuries (68.9% vs 61.9%, p = 0.001) and their median Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) Thorax was significantly higher (3.0 [IQR: 0-3] vs 2.0 [IQR: 0-3], p <0.001). Women had a higher prevalence of pelvic fractures (29.3% vs 21.5%, p <0.001) and suffered more fractures of long bones in their upper extremities (22.2% vs 15.7%, p <0.001). There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between women and men (15.7% vs 14.6%, p = 0.493), nor in other outcome parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of data on severely injured trauma patients transported by helicopter emergency medical services in Switzerland. While there were notable differences between women and men in terms of accident mechanisms and injury characteristics, no significant differences in outcome parameters were observed."

    "title": "Management and Outcomes of Blunt Renal Trauma: A Retrospective Analysis from a High-Volume Urban Emergency Department.",
    "abstract": "Background: Renal trauma accounts for approximately 3-5% of all trauma cases, predominantly affecting young males. The most common etiology is blunt trauma, particularly due to road traffic accidents, and it frequently occurs as part of polytrauma involving multiple organ systems. Management strategies are primarily dictated by hemodynamic stability, overall clinical condition, comorbidities, and injury severity graded according to the AAST classification. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of non-operative management (NOM) in high-grade renal trauma (AAST grades III-V), beyond its established role in low-grade injuries (grades I-II). Secondary endpoints included the identification of independent prognostic factors for NOM failure and in-hospital mortality. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study including patients diagnosed with blunt renal trauma who presented to the Emergency Department of Policlinico Umberto I in Rome between 1 January 2013 and 30 April 2024. Collected data comprised demographics, trauma mechanism, vital signs, hemodynamic status (shock index), laboratory tests, blood gas analysis, hematuria, number of transfused RBC units in the first 24 h, AAST renal injury grade, ISS, associated injuries, treatment approach, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Statistical analyses, including multivariable logistic regression, were performed using SPSS v28.0. Results: A total of 244 patients were included. Low-grade injuries (AAST I-II) accounted for 43% (n = 105), while high-grade injuries (AAST III-V) represented 57% (n = 139). All patients with low-grade injuries were managed non-operatively. Among high-grade injuries, 124 patients (89%) were treated with NOM, including observation, angiography ± angioembolization, stenting, or nephrostomy. Only 15 patients (11%) required nephrectomy, primarily due to persistent hemodynamic instability. The overall mortality rate was 13.5% (33 patients) and was more closely associated with the overall injury burden than with renal injury severity. Multivariable analysis identified shock index and active bleeding on CT as independent predictors of NOM failure, whereas ISS and age were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Notably, AAST grade did not independently predict either outcome. Conclusions: In line with the current international literature, our study confirms that NOM is the treatment of choice not only for low-grade renal injuries but also for carefully selected hemodynamically stable patients with high-grade trauma. Our findings highlight the critical role of physiological parameters and overall ISS in guiding management decisions and underscore the need for individualized assessment to minimize unnecessary nephrectomies and optimize patient outcomes."

This report presents the case of a 24-year-old male who sustained multiple gunshot wounds, leading to the formation of an ilio-iliac AVF and a pseudoaneurysm. The patient arrived at the emergency department hemodynamically unstable, with bullet wounds to the forearm, thigh, and lumbosacral region. Initial non-arterial phase CT revealed a pseudoaneurysm anterior to the right external iliac vessels and a surrounding hematoma, raising suspicion for AVF. A second biphasic CTA confirmed an AVF connection between the right external iliac artery and external iliac vein, as well as the arterialization of the vein. Additionally, fat stranding and bowel wall thickening suggested potential hollow viscus injury. Due to the patient's unstable condition and possible intra-abdominal injuries, an open laparotomy was performed. A stent was placed in the right external iliac artery, the vein was primarily repaired, and serosal injuries to the duodenum and cecum were surgically addressed. The patient recovered gradually, although a persistent serous discharge was noted and managed in follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering AVF in penetrating abdominal trauma and the critical role of biphasic CTA in diagnosis and surgical planning."

Part of this spectrum of presentations is self-directed violence. Self-directed violence involves suicidal acts and non-suicidal self-injuries that can result in serious morbidity and mortality. This study examines characteristics and outcomes of patients who presented to US trauma centers with self-inflicted injuries and identifies factors associated with survival to hospital discharge in this patient population. We extracted data in a retrospective, observational manner from the 2020 National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) 2020. The NTDB includes data from over 900 trauma centers (900/2,294 total trauma centers in the United States, 39.2%). We performed a descriptive analysis of characteristics, injury patterns and outcomes. All variables were tabulated by outcome (died: yes/no). We then conducted a multivariable logistic regression using a stepwise technique to identify factors associated with the patients' survival to hospital discharge. A total of 12,824 patients with self-inflicted injuries were included in this analysis. Their median age was 35 years (interquartile range 25-50), and they were mostly males (74.7%) and White (69.6%). Patients were mostly transported by ground ambulance (78.9%) to Level I (60.6%) and Level II (33.5%) trauma centers. Most patients had a pre-existing condition (70.2%). These included mental/personality disorder (48.2%), alcohol use disorder (11.5%), and substance use disorder (17.7%). The most common mechanism of injury was penetrating trauma (71.6%), followed by blunt trauma (18.0%) and burns (1%). Cutting/piercing was the most common penetrating mechanism (60%) compared with firearm-related trauma (40%). Severe injury (Injury Severity Score ≥ 16) was present in 32.8% of patients.

    "abstract": "Internal hernias represent an uncommon etiology of small bowel obstruction (SBO). Among these, herniation through a defect in the broad ligament is one of the least common types. Because symptoms are vague and imaging findings are often minimal, these presentations can be easily overlooked and may progress to bowel ischemia or gangrene. A 47-year-old multiparous woman with no history of abdominal surgery presented to the emergency department with severe, worsening abdominal pain that developed over the past 12 hours. Ultrasound was the only imaging modality available. It detected free fluid in the abdomen but did not identify a specific organ abnormality. The clinical team initially proceeded with an open appendicectomy, which was subsequently converted to an exploratory laparotomy. During the procedure, they identified an internal hernia that had passed through a defect in the left broad ligament. Approximately 25 cm of the necrotic bowel was resected, and the remaining segments were joined with a primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, the patient recovered without incident and was discharged home once her bowel function resumed. While broad ligament hernias are exceedingly rare, they should be kept in mind as a possible explanation for obstruction in females who have not undergone pelvic surgery. Preoperative diagnosis is frequently missed because of subtle imaging clues and the infrequency of the disease in everyday practice. When advanced radiology is limited or inconclusive, surgical exploration remains the most reliable route to both identify the problem and provide timely treatment. Although rare, broad ligament hernias should be considered in female patients presenting with SBO and no prior abdominal operations. Prompt recognition and surgical intervention are vital to minimize morbidity and mortality."

We present a 48-year-old male with known PJS who arrived at the emergency department with right flank abdominal pain. CT imaging revealed multiple small bowel intussusceptions-most notably in the right flank-alongside hyperdense intraluminal polyps. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, where manual reduction of the intussusceptions and surgical resection of polyps were performed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was enrolled in a surveillance program. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome who developed multiple small bowel intussusceptions. This case highlights the importance of cross-sectional imaging, particularly CT and MRI enterography, in diagnosing complications and guiding treatment in adult PJS. Long-term management involves routine imaging, polyp surveillance, and cancer screening."

    "abstract": "Acute severe dyspnoea is a critical medical emergency frequently encountered in low- and middle-income countries, where resource limitations significantly challenge timely diagnosis and management. Our institutional protocol (PGIMER, Chandigarh) offers a practical approach tailored to these constraints. It emphasises a structured clinical assessment and prioritises readily available basic investigations, including chest radiography, arterial blood gas analysis, and electrocardiogram, to differentiate common aetiologies such as pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, cardiac tamponade, and acute heart failure. The diagnostic approach is structured across seven clinical domains-Risk factors, History, Examination findings, Laboratory results, Imaging features, Treatment (empirical) response, and Alternate diagnosis exclusion (mnemonic RHELITA). A simplified diagnostic algorithm for pulmonary embolism is included to optimize use of advanced imaging."

    "abstract": "Adult intussusception is rare, occurring in only 1 out of 1300 (0.08%) abdominal surgeries and accounting <1% of adult intestinal obstruction cases. The overall incidence of adult intussusception is 1-3 cases per 100 000 population and comprises 5% of all intussusception cases. Idiopathic ileocecal colic intussusception in adults is exceptionally rare, making our case a unique and noteworthy contribution to the existing literature. A 23-year-old male presented with abdominal pain for 2 weeks, associated with vomiting and black-colored stool. On examination, mild tenderness and a palpable mass were noted over the right lumbar region. Ultrasonography and Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed features of ileocecal colic intussusception. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, with reduction of the intussusceptum using the Hutchinson maneuver, followed by a limited right hemicolectomy. Although intussusception is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children aged ≤5 years, it is rare in adults. When it does occur in adults, >90% of cases are associated with an identifiable lead point, with only a few cases being idiopathic. The most commonly reported types of intussusception in adults are colocolic and enteric, followed by ileocolic and ileocecal types. Acute intestinal obstruction is not the typical presentation of adult intussusception; rather, the majority of cases present with subacute or chronic symptoms. History of recurrent intermittent partial bowel obstruction over days to years may suggest intussusception. Early diagnosis and timely intervention can significantly reduce patient morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Traumatic and iatrogenic renal injuries, particularly high-grade trauma and complications following nephron-sparing surgeries, pose significant clinical challenges. Complications such as urinomas, pseudoaneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) can lead to serious morbidity if not promptly addressed. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery, offering effective hemorrhage control while preserving renal function. We report the case of a 51-year-old male patient who sustained a Grade V shattered left kidney following blunt trauma. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with left nephrectomy. Postoperatively, a persistent urinoma developed from a retained kidney remnant. SAE was successfully performed to manage this complication, achieving complete resolution without further surgical intervention. SAE demonstrates high technical success and clinical efficacy in treating renal vascular complications after trauma or surgery. It offers the advantages of nephron preservation, reduced morbidity, and adaptability through various embolic agents. Despite risks such as post-embolization syndrome and potential non-target embolization, SAE remains the preferred approach in hemodynamically stable patients or those at high risk for reoperation. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are essential for optimal outcomes. SAE is a safe, effective, and nephron-sparing treatment modality for complex renal vascular injuries and complications. It should be considered a first-line therapeutic option in appropriate clinical settings, especially when surgical reintervention poses high risks."

    "abstract": "Jejunal diverticulosis is an uncommon condition, and its complications-such as perforation-pose a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, particularly in elderly patients. Contained perforation is especially difficult to identify due to its non-specific clinical presentation and subtle radiological findings. We report the case of an 82-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and irritable bowel syndrome. She presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension and tenderness in the epigastric and mesogastric regions, without signs of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and impaired renal and hepatic function. Although initial imaging studies suggested a possible bowel obstruction, a non-contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan was diagnostic. It demonstrated multiple jejunal diverticula, one of which exhibited an elongated morphology, wall thinning, and adjacent mesenteric fat stranding-findings consistent with a contained perforation. Due to persistent symptoms despite conservative management, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperatively, a perforated jejunal diverticulum was identified 90 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. A 5 cm segmental small bowel resection was performed, followed by a stapled side-to-side anastomosis with a functionally end-to-end configuration. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day four with favorable outpatient follow-up. This case underscores the importance of considering complicated jejunal diverticulitis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in elderly patients, even in the presence of atypical clinical findings. A non-contrast CT scan was essential for the early identification of the contained perforation, allowing for timely surgical intervention and a favorable outcome. A high index of clinical suspicion is crucial in this patient population to avoid potentially fatal diagnostic delays."

    "abstract": "This case report presents the successful surgical management of a 34-year-old male who had blunt chest trauma resulting in a left atrial appendage tear after a traffic accident. He arrived at the emergency department 30 minutes post-injury in a gasping state, showing signs of hypovolemic shock, tachycardia (132 bpm), hypotension (blood pressure 88/48 mm Hg) and decreased breath sounds on the left side. The initial management included fluid resuscitation and the insertion of an intercostal drain, which drained 1.2 litres of blood. After the initial fluid resuscitation, haemodynamic stability was achieved with no further drainage from the chest tube. A computed tomography scan revealed haemothorax, bilateral rib fractures, right clavicular and scapular fractures and no active contrast extravasation. However, in the intensive care unit, the chest tube drainage suddenly increased to 250-300 ml/hour with escalating vasopressor requirements. An emergency left chest exploration was performed using thoracoscopy, which revealed significant blood clots and active bleeding from a pericardial defect, leading to conversion to an antero-lateral thoracotomy. The left atrial appendage tear was identified and repaired, achieving complete haemostasis. Postoperatively, the patient stabilized with ongoing intensive care management. This case underscores the challenges in managing traumatic cardiac injuries and highlights the critical need for timely surgical intervention to enhance survival outcomes in severely injured patients."

    "abstract": "The spleen is also the largest lymphoid organ and has important immune and haematopoietic functions. Traumatic splenic rupture often results in haemorrhagic shock and is life-threatening. In the past, total splenectomy was performed for various degrees of splenic injury, which caused great harm to the patient. Over the past few decades, the treatment of blunt splenic injury has also changed significantly, from total splenectomy to a focus on procedures that preserve splenic function. At the same time, the use of splenic artery embolization in high-grade splenic injuries has also reduced the failure rate of non-surgical treatment and the incidence of conversion to open splenectomy. According to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) spleen injury grading, this study selected 80 patients treated in our emergency department for blunt splenic injuries of grade II-III between 1 January 2023 and 1 January 2025. These patients were the study subjects (40 patients received partial splenic artery embolization (intervention group) and 40 patients received splenectomy (control group)). The clinical therapeutic outcomes of the two treatment approaches were analysed by SPSS. In contrast to the control group, patients in the intervention group exhibited reduced operation time, time to first flatus, time to removal of drainage tubes and hospitalization time. Furthermore, the incidence of surgical complications was found to be lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The T lymphocyte CD4 + /CD8 values of the intervention group were higher than those in the control group at 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Partial splenic artery embolization has obvious advantages in the treatment of grade II-III blunt splenic injuries, and provides data support and reference significance for the selection of treatment methods for low-grade blunt splenic injuries. This study is a statistical analysis of relevant data for patients who have received a medical intervention and therefore does not involve trial registration."

In this prospective observational study, participants were selected from patients undergoing emergency gastrointestinal surgery at our hospital. The physiological component of POSSUM and P-POSSUM scores was calculated preoperatively, while the operative component was determined intraoperatively. A total of 45 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 37.9 ± 15.7 years. The male-female ratio was 1.5:1.0. Intestinal perforation was the most common diagnosis (15; 33.3%) that necessitated exploratory laparotomy. The cutoff of POSSUM morbidity score of 87.5% had a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 92.6%, while the cutoff P-POSSUM morbidity score of 88.6% yielded a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of 96.3%. Regarding mortality prediction, the cutoff POSSUM mortality score of 56.7% had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 94.6%, while a P-POSSUM mortality cutoff score of 22.7% had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 81.1%. Both POSSUM and P-POSSUM scores demonstrated significant sensitivity and specificity in predicting morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing emergency gastrointestinal surgeries.

Distal septic embolization from angio-IA with involvement of the small and large bowel is extremely uncommon, and clinical manifestations of bowel ischemia and perforation may be masked due to immunosuppression. We present herein the first reported case of peritonitis secondary to jejunal and cecal perforation secondary to angio-IA after lung transplantation (LT) in a 62-year-old male. The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute cellular rejection requiring high-dose immunosuppression. His course was complicated by respiratory failure secondary to IA, with resulting multiorgan system dysfunction during which time peritonitis was noted on examination and cross-sectional imaging demonstrated pneumatosis, portal venous gas, and pneumoperitoneum. The patient required emergent surgical intervention and underwent an exploratory laparotomy, jejunal resection, right hemicolectomy, and end ileostomy with colonic mucus fistula. Final pathologic analysis of resected specimens demonstrated angio-IA in both the jejunal and cecal segments with associated transmural ischemic necrosis. Bowel perforation secondary to angio-IA is a very rare but serious complication after LT that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Evaluation requires a high index of suspicion in the setting of immunosuppression and often concomitant extraintestinal pathologies. Early, aggressive surgical intervention is necessary."

However, in rare cases, pneumoperitoneum can result from thoracic air leaks and may be managed conservatively unless it is causing diaphragmatic splinting. The aim of the study was to raise awareness about pneumoperitoneum secondary to pneumothorax, emphasizing nonoperative management to prevent unnecessary surgical interventions and associated morbidity. A 1-month-old female infant presented with respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation. Following intubation, the child deteriorated clinically, developing significant abdominal distension. Chest X-ray and abdominal X-ray revealed bilateral pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum. Bilateral intercostal drains (ICDs) were placed, but due to worsening abdominal distension, an exploratory laparotomy was performed within a few hours. No evidence of hollow viscus perforation was found. Tense pneumoperitoneum confirmed with gush of air on opening the abdomen. The presence of air inside the left paracolic gutter extending to the diaphragm indicating it is from pneumothorax. The abdomen was closed with a drain, which was removed after 48 h. Feeds were initiated after 48 h. ICD was removed after 5 days and she was discharged after 7 days. Spontaneous pneumoperitoneum secondary to pneumothorax is an uncommon but important differential diagnosis. Recognizing key clinical clues, such as absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, history of respiratory distress, and extraperitoneal air on imaging, can facilitate conservative management, avoiding unnecessary surgical intervention."

The condition typically presents during infancy, and adult-onset cases, particularly in elderly patients, are rare and often pose a diagnostic challenge due to their nonspecific and variable clinical presentation. We report the case of a mid-hexagenerian female with a known history of hypertension, aortic dissection with coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, who presented with acute-onset colicky abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and obstipation. Imaging revealed a 180-degree clockwise twisting of the distal ileal loop and the characteristic \"whirlpool sign,\" indicative of volvulus. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed midgut volvulus secondary to malrotation with Ladd's bands and an incidental finding of uninflamed broad-based jejunal diverticula. A Ladd's procedure was successfully performed to release adhesions and bands between the bowel and mesentery. Postoperative ileus complicated the patient's recovery but was resolved with conservative management. In elderly adults, midgut volvulus secondary to intestinal malrotation should be considered in unexplained cases of intestinal obstruction. Progression to bowel ischemia can be prevented by early radiological evaluation and timely surgical management. Jejunal diverticulosis coexistence can be challenging when it is inflamed and perforated; however, in our case, it was a silent spectator not involved in the cause of volvulus."

This case report describes a 32-year-old third gravida (G3, P0+2) with recurrent pregnancy loss, having a 16.9 cm uterine fibroid and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (managed with bisoprolol), who presented at 24 weeks with severe abdominal pain. Although her vitals were stable, a markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (245 mg/dL) raised concern for acute pathology. Initial ultrasound incorrectly localized the fibroid to the left, but exploratory laparotomy revealed a 180-degree uterine torsion with contralateral fibroid position, revising the diagnosis from fibroid degeneration to this rare emergency, leading to detorsion and myomectomy. At 30 weeks' gestation, cervical insufficiency (a short cervix measuring 0.5 cm with funneling) was successfully managed with an Arabin pessary and weekly 500 mg injections of hydroxyprogesterone, prolonging the pregnancy to 34 weeks and resulting in an outlet forceps delivery of a healthy 1.9 kg infant. This case highlights the importance of surgical exploration when clinical suspicion contradicts imaging findings, the feasibility of pregnancy-preserving surgery for uterine torsion, and the effectiveness of combined mechanical-hormonal therapy for cervical insufficiency following complex uterine interventions. Multidisciplinary care was critical to manage overlapping high-risk factors, including fibroids, cardiac disease, and preterm cervical changes, ultimately leading to a favorable outcome."

Diagnosis requires imaging but necessitates more cautious consideration in pediatrics due to radiation concerns. Management options span observation, anticoagulation, and various endovascular interventions, but decisions are complicated by limited literature and the presence of other traumatic injuries. Further collaborative research is needed to provide clarity when caring for pediatric patients with BCVI to guide diagnosis and management. A four-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department as a trauma activation secondary to injuries sustained after falling from a moving \"swamp buggy\" recreational vehicle. He was found to have severe craniofacial and cervical spine injuries including open bilateral mandibular fractures, C2-C3 distraction injury with associated spinal cord injury, and blunt left common carotid injury subsequently complicated by a left hemispheric stroke with right hemiplegia. Management challenges arose due to the complexity of injuries, with decisions regarding management of initial injuries and subsequent stroke treatment being particularly intricate. The patient underwent various interventions, including closed reduction of spinal fractures, halo vest placement, mandibular fracture repair and ultimately open internal fixation of spinal fractures via spinal fusion. Despite the severity of injuries, the patient had a positive outcome, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in trauma care.

Among the rarest etiologies is ileo-ileal knotting, a rarely encountered surgical emergency with only seven reported cases in pregnancy, including one ileo-ileal knot, as per Shimizu et al. (2014). Its timely diagnosis is often hindered by overlapping obstetric and gastrointestinal symptoms. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman at 25 weeks gestation who experienced severe abdominal pain, distension, and constipation for five days. Initially managed conservatively at a peripheral facility, she suffered a spontaneous fetal loss and was referred to a tertiary center. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an ileo-ileal knot with necrotic bowel, necessitating resection and primary anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was complicated by wound infection but resulted in full recovery with no long-term sequelae. Ileo-ileal knotting results in rapid bowel ischemia and necrosis due to vascular compromise. Risk factors may include pregnancy-related bowel displacement and predisposing anatomical anomalies such as adhesions or Meckel's diverticulum. Diagnosis is often delayed due to atypical presentation and limited access to imaging in low-resource settings. Early surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of management, as delayed treatment significantly increases morbidity and mortality. This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for rare causes of intestinal obstruction in pregnancy. Prompt surgical management can improve maternal and fetal outcomes. In low-resource settings, early clinical decision-making remains essential to preventing complications when advanced diagnostics are unavailable."

Post-operative management was straightforward. Obturator hernia is a relatively rare type of abdominal hernia in which the abdominal contents protrude through the obturator canal, which can lead to obstruction of the small intestine. Most patients with obturator hernia present with symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Today, CT is the examination of choice. Strangulated obturator hernia is treated surgically. Obturator hernia is usually asymptomatic, but can be complicated by strangulation. CT is the key examination for positive diagnosis.

We present a rare case of coexistence of congenital intestinal malrotation and jejunal diverticula presenting as a volvulus. We present a case of a 78-year-old male with no comorbidities presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen, diagnosed as a case of intestinal obstruction in a virgin abdomen, and treated conservatively. Meanwhile, CT abdomen and pelvis showed volvulus of the small intestine, so the patient was taken for exploratory laparotomy, which revealed the small bowel rotation with a high cecum and a narrow mesentery. Ladd's procedure was performed without any perioperative complications. Few reports of congenital intestinal malrotation in the elderly are presented in the literature. This highlights the importance of evaluating all patients for malrotation if presenting in elderly patients with a virgin acute abdomen to prevent complications like bowel ischemia. Elderly patients presenting with acute intestinal obstruction, if not improving conservatively, should make the clinician think about congenital intestinal malrotation as a differential diagnosis as well, among all other common causes."

    "title": "Analysis of Massive Transfusion Protocol Utilization in Trauma Across Sociodemographic Groups.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Blood shortages are a national crisis, creating dangerous scenarios for patients requiring the use of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP). A judicious use of blood products is critical to rescue salvageable patients while refraining from unnecessary MTP to save precious resources. This study examines effect of trauma characteristics, socioeconomic variables and markers of futility on the likelihood of activating and receiving MTP in the trauma setting. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, emergency department (ED) trauma activations from a database of an urban Level I trauma center were analyzed from 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2022, inclusive. In-ED mortality, RBC transfusion volumes during initial resuscitation, patient sociodemographic data, and trauma event factors were analyzed. The primary outcomes were the dichotomous outcomes of MTP activation and MTP transfusion. Univariable analyses and logistic regressions were conducted, with class balancing sensitivities applied to the multivariable regressions to adjust for imbalance in the data. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among the 8670 trauma activations, there was a 0.3% in-ED mortality rate. MTP activation and MTP transfusion were associated with higher in-ED mortality rates (3.8% and 15.4%, respectively, compared to 0.2% without MTP). Younger patients, male patients, and Medicaid recipients were more likely to undergo MTP activation; Medicare patients were less likely. Penetrating trauma substantially increased the likelihood of both MTP activation (odds ratio (OR) 5.81) and transfusion (OR 3.63). The logistic regression models identified the presence of penetrating trauma, lower probability of survival, and age as the most important covariates. Models demonstrated high discriminatory value (area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.876 for MTP activation, 0.935 for MTP transfusion) and precision (0.974 for activation, 0.994 for transfusion), with class balancing further improving model performance and precision scores. Conclusions: These results are significant as assessing the futility of MTP should be equitable, and future transfusion guidelines should consider salvageability in cases with a low probability of survival despite age and mechanism."

    "abstract": "Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare neoplasm that has a roughly 15-30% chance of transforming into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Acute leukemias have been known to cause pleural or pericardial effusions but having CMML transform into AML while presenting as a cardiac myeloid sarcoma causing pericardial effusions makes this case unique. A 59-year-old patient presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and was found to be in cardiac tamponade requiring urgent care. The thoracic surgery team performed a pericardiectomy and placed a window drain. Cardiac tissue biopsy proved cardiac myeloid sarcoma with immature blasts and myeloid cells. Initial bone marrow biopsy on admission showed hypercellularity with 19% blasts and abnormal monocytes with multilineage dysplasia on aspirate differential, with positive KRAS and TET2 mutations on next-generation sequencing analysis. There was no evidence of a BCR/ABL1 fusion on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and chromosomal analysis demonstrated a normal karyotype. At this time, the patient met the WHO criteria for a CMML-2 diagnosis. A follow-up bone marrow biopsy closer to discharge showed a 33% blast count pointing towards a CMML-2 transformation into AML. Remarkably, he was able to improve and was discharged from the hospital. He was admitted again to the hospital to initiate chemotherapy. Such complex cases are rarely reported. Here we discuss the diagnosis and treatment of CMML transformed into AML as well as the rarity of cardiac myeloid sarcomas with an in-depth literature review."

    "abstract": "Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a rare condition that most commonly affects postpartum women. It is particularly prevalent in the first 10 days postpartum, a period when women are more prone to developing this condition. The right ovarian vein is often affected due to its tortuous nature and less competent valves. OVT presents similarly to acute abdominal conditions, such as acute appendicitis, especially when the right ovarian vein is involved. Given the overlap in clinical presentation, diagnosis requires high-quality imaging techniques and a high degree of suspicion. Herein, we report a rare case of OVT in a young postpartum female who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms of acute abdomen. The patient had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis treatment. A provisional diagnosis of a perforated appendix was made, and a lower midline exploratory laparotomy was planned. During surgery, the appendix and intestines appeared normal, but a distended and thrombosed right ovarian vein was found. The affected ovarian vein was excised, and the patient was placed on anticoagulants postoperatively. The recovery was unremarkable, and anticoagulants were continued for six months. OVT is most commonly seen in the early postpartum period, especially within the first 10 days. Due to its anatomical characteristics, the right ovarian vein is more commonly involved. The clinical presentation of OVT can closely mimic acute abdomen or acute appendicitis, making diagnosis challenging. Accurate diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and advanced imaging techniques to differentiate OVT from other conditions with similar presentations."

    "title": "Splenic Torsion Following Blunt Abdominal Trauma.",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Splenic torsion is a well-known and reported clinical problem. Splenic torsions after abdominal trauma represent a small group of cases that involve surgical management. They manifest primarily as abdominal pain, and the diagnosis is made based on imaging studies-ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Methods: This work aimed to analyze traumatic splenic torsions in terms of their clinical course, symptoms, timing, involvement of imaging techniques in the diagnosis, histopathological examination, and overall outcome. We searched databases using the desk research method under the keywords \"splenic torsion\", \"torsion\", and \"spleen\", as well as in combination with \"traumatic\", finding a total of eight cases, which we included in our analysis. Results: The eight cases were analyzed, comprising four females and four males, with an average age of 16.25 years (range 5-29 years). Traffic accidents were the most frequent cause of injury (five cases), while the circumstances were unclear in the remaining three. Immediate abdominal symptoms appeared in six patients. Splenic torsion was preoperatively diagnosed in five out of seven confirmed cases. A total of seven patients underwent laparotomy with splenectomy. In one case, laparoscopy converted to laparotomy with splenopexy preserved the spleen. Histopathology, performed in only two cases, confirmed splenic infarction in one patient; infarction status could not be determined in the remaining five due to missing data. Conclusions: Post-traumatic splenic torsions are a group of atypical injuries as the primary and immediate consequence of the trauma suffered is not anatomical-structural damage to the organ, such as a rupture. Mostly affecting young people, the cases described in the professional literature involve the main spleen, which was considered to be \"wandering\", suggesting that this is a key predisposing factor for splenic torsion following blunt trauma and requiring diagnostic imaging for diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Background: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term morbidity, particularly in high-acuity trauma settings. We aim to evaluate the clinical, physiologic, and socioeconomic factors associated with outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) at a single urban Level 1 trauma center. Method: This is a single-center, retrospective study of patients presenting with severe TBI between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2023 at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, New York. Patients were identified using ICD trauma codes and an Abbreviated Injury Severity (AIS) Head score of ≥3. Demographic data, injury characteristics, vital signs, airway interventions, alcohol level, and insurance status were analyzed. Result: A total of 1130 patients met the inclusion criteria. The cohort was predominantly male (76.1%) with a mean age of 52.7 years. Blunt trauma accounted for 97.8% of cases, with a mortality rate of 13.8%, while penetrating trauma comprised 2.2%, with a markedly higher mortality rate of 48%. Patients who died as full code had lower mean systolic blood pressure (82.5 mmHg), oxygen saturation (63%), and shorter emergency department stays (~3.7 h). The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 12.6, dropping to 6.0 in patients who died. Moreover, higher AIS Head and Injury Severity Score (ISS) values were correlated with worse outcomes. Severely intoxicated patients had higher TBI incidence, with no clear difference observed when compared to normal BAC levels. Self-pay patients exhibited the highest mortality (40%). All associations were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Severe TBI outcomes are significantly influenced by injury mechanisms, physiologic parameters, and socioeconomic status. These findings emphasize the need for targeted prognostic tools and improved trauma system preparedness for TBI patients at risk of poor outcomes."

    "abstract": "Hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. Although in-hospital calcium replacement protocols target normocalcaemia, UK pre-hospital services lack standardised calcium monitoring capabilities and demonstrate significant variation in calcium supplementation. No evidence-based guidelines exist for pre- and early in-hospital calcium administration in patients receiving blood product transfusion. This study characterises current UK pre-hospital calcium management in patients requiring blood transfusion prior to ionised calcium (iCa) measurement. A multicentre pre-hospital service evaluation across five UK Helicopter Emergency Medicine Services (HEMS) from February to April 2024, including all adult trauma patients receiving pre-hospital blood transfusions. Data collected included baseline demographics, pre- and in-hospital blood products transfused, calcium dose and calcium measurement in the Emergency Department. The primary outcome was iCa on initial blood gas measurement. Fifty-eight patients were included, stratified by calcium levels on hospital arrival: 25 (43.1%) hypocalcaemic, 20 (34.5%) normocalcaemic, and 13 (22.4%) were hypercalcaemic. Most patients were male (84%) sustained blunt trauma (76%) and the overall median iCa was 1.14 mmol/L on first blood gas analysis. Pre-hospital calcium was given to 57%, with hypercalcaemic patients more likely to receive replacement. Normocalcaemic patients received fewer blood products overall. Increasing blood product administration was associated with lower calcium levels, especially in those not receiving pre-hospital calcium. Hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia were common. Calcium replacement protocols may under- or overtreat due to diverse injury patterns and baseline patient factors. Pre-hospital point-of-care testing (POCT) for iCa could help tailor treatment, especially in cases with longer times between injury and arrival at hospital. We demonstrate the feasibility of collecting comprehensive pre- and in-hospital data across multiple HEMS services to better inform future guidelines in patients with traumatic haemorrhage."

    "abstract": "Septic pericarditis is a rare but life-threatening condition that can mimic acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A 45-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension presented with acute chest pain and hypotension. Initial electrocardiogram raised suspicion for ACS; however, coronary angiography showed no coronary artery disease. The patient subsequently developed a rapidly progressive pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, necessitating urgent pericardiocentesis. Drained pericardial fluid was purulent and cultures confirmed Neisseria meningitidis infection. The patient received systemic antibiotics and continued drainage of pericardial fluid, resulting in complete recovery. This case highlights the importance of considering infectious etiologies like N meningitidis in patients presenting with symptoms resembling ACS. Literature indicates that hyperinvasive strains of N meningitidis can cause severe cardiac complications, making awareness crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. N meningitidis can present with septic pericarditis mimicking ACS. Prompt recognition and multidisciplinary management are essential for favorable outcomes."

    "title": "Whole Blood Versus Blood Components in Prehospital Care.",
    "abstract": "Whether clinical outcomes differ for hemorrhaging patients receiving prehospital whole blood versus blood component transfusion is unclear. Furthermore, most prehospital transfusion studies are limited to injured patients and commingle interfacility transfers with 9-1-1 scene responses. This study assessed outcomes exclusively among 9-1-1 scene response patients receiving prehospital transfusion with either whole blood or blood components for traumatic and non-traumatic hemorrhage. Using the ESO Data Collaborative for 2019- 2023, patients 8 to 100 years old who received whole blood or blood components were identified. Interfacility transports, patients receiving blood products prior to EMS arrival, and those with pre-arrival cardiac arrest were excluded. The primary prehospital outcome was change in shock index, along with changes in individual vital signs (Glasgow coma score (GCS), heart rate, systolic blood pressure). The primary hospital outcome was mortality at emergency department (ED) or hospital disposition. We also analyzed adverse events. Of 1,990 eligible patients, 1,515 received whole blood and 475 received blood components. There were significant baseline differences between the two groups, with whole blood more frequently used by ground ambulance services, in urban areas and for penetrating trauma. Patients receiving blood components had statistically greater decreases in shock index (median change, -0.3 vs. -0.2, p = 0.040) and heart rate (median change, -7 bpm vs. - 4 bpm, p = 0.007), but there was no significant difference in mortality for patients receiving whole blood vs. blood components after multivariable analysis adjusting for baseline differences (adjusted odds ratio: 1.7, CI: 0.6-4.9). No patients in either group received prehospital epinephrine, and there were no ED diagnoses of transfusion reaction. Three whole blood patients had diagnoses related to thromboembolic events, but these were unlikely to be related to the transfusion. In this retrospective observational study of 9-1-1 scene response patients with traumatic or non-traumatic hemorrhage, differences between shock index and heart rate for patients receiving whole blood or blood components were of questionable clinical significance, and adjusted mortality did not significantly differ for the two groups. There were no instances of prehospital anaphylaxis or ED transfusion reactions. Both transfusion strategies appear equally effective and safe."

    "abstract": "Controversies remain about the decision to proceed to aortic occlusion (AO) using either REBOA or resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) in severely injured patients worldwide. Present study aims to identify and evaluate the differences in AO technique use related to patients' conditions. This was a comparative study using a multicenter registry of postinjury AO (October 2013-February 2022). AO via REBOA was compared with RT performed in the emergency department of facilities experienced in both procedures and documented in Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (AORTA) registry. Participants were adult trauma patients 16 years or older who experienced AO via REBOA zone 1 vs RT. The primary outcome was to identify the differences between patients treated with RT or REBOA. Ethical committee study approval number (Maryland IRB #HCR-HP-00,055,545-11). 1937 patients were included. Median age: 34 (25-49), 1599 (82.5 %) were men. Penetrating trauma: 52.4 %. REBOA was adopted in 501 (25.9 %) patients, RT in 1436 (74.1 %). Patients treated with REBOA were older (40vs32 years, p < 0.001), suffered more frequently blunt trauma (76.3 %vs37.7 %, p < 0.001) and had higher ISS (33vs26, p = 0.003). Fewer of them underwent prehospital cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation (23.2 %vs49.8 % p < 0.001); had higher median SBP and HR (83vs0, p < 0.001 and 106vs0, p < 0.001 respectively), serum lactate levels were lower (7.5vs10.3 p < 0.001). SBP≥ 60 mmHg pre-hospital and at-admission (OR 2.27) and GCS>8 at admission (OR 2.24), trauma cases admitted/year (>4000/year, OR 4.41), transfer from another trauma center (OR 1.94) were related to the use of REBOA. Higher Injury severity score (ISS >55, OR 0.66), lower number of trauma treated (<4000/year, OR 0.66) and penetrating trauma (OR 0.24) were related to the use of RT. REBOA was more frequently used for older patients with blunt trauma, higher prehospital systolic blood pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores above 8. RT was more commonly performed in penetrating trauma, lower injury severity scores, and facilities with fewer annual trauma admissions. These findings suggest that patient characteristics and institutional factors significantly differed between patients treated with REBOA or RT, underscoring the need for further research."

    "abstract": "A 71-year-old woman was diagnosed with a subacute myocardial infarction caused by an obstruction in the middle segment of the right coronary artery. Two hours after successful percutaneous coronary intervention, bedside transthoracic echocardiography revealed an interventricular septal perforation. Three hours later, the patient developed cardiac tamponade. An emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, which promptly restored hemodynamic stability. Echocardiographic findings suggested oozing from a minor perforation of the postinfarct inferior wall. Subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging identified a basal inferoposterior septal perforation connected with an intramyocardial dissection. After intensive medical management, the patient gradually recovered and was discharged on the 135th day of admission. Five years of follow-up were uneventful with optimal medication therapy. - Ventricular septal perforation following a myocardial infarction can result in intramyocardial dissection, which may extend to the epicardium and eventually lead to cardiac tamponade.- Physicians should individualize treatment strategies for each patient based on various factors, especially in cases with rare and complex post-infarct complications.- Advanced imaging techniques are recommended for assessing complex mechanical complications following a myocardial infarction."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a rare disease characterized by gas accumulation in the intestinal wall, and is usually treated conservatively. Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) sometimes present with severe abdominal pain as the first symptom, which may be misdiagnosed. We report a case of PCI in a patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) misdiagnosed as gastrointestinal perforation and underwent exploratory laparotomy. A 41-year-old woman with a history of DM treated with miglitol, an α-glucosidase inhibitors (αGI), was admitted to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed thickening of the ascending colon wall and scattered free gas around it, and the possibility of tumor perforation was considered. The patient was diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation and DM but was revised to PCI and DKA after surgery. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy; however, no signs of digestive perforation were found. The patient developed DKA after surgery and received conservative treatment, including antibiotics, insulin, fluid support, oxygen therapy, and cessation of miglitol. Ketoacidosis was controlled, and the abdominal pain resolved with conservative treatment. She was discharged 16 days later and no longer required αGI therapy. She did not develop gastrointestinal symptoms or any signs of PCI on computed tomography imaging within 3 months. PCI is a rare disease with great heterogeneity in etiology, treatment and prognosis and comorbidities like diabetes may increase the chances of misdiagnosis. Surgeons should pay attention to the patient's medical history and examination and carefully identify the real disease that triggers the symptoms to avoid misdiagnosis."

The guidelines are based on current best evidence for an ERAS approach to patients who have had major injuries and polytrauma. These guidelines are not exhaustive but collate the best available evidence on important components of care for this patient population. As some of the evidence is extrapolated from elective surgery and non-trauma emergency surgery, some of the components need further evaluation in future studies."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade following blunt and penetrating chest trauma is a life-threatening condition, and early recognition clinically and with the cardiac component in the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (cFAST) is paramount. Performing an emergent pericardiocentesis is key in achieving hemodynamic stability. A male victim of a motor-vehicle accident presented with distended neck veins, muffled heart sounds, and hemodynamic instability. The cFAST confirmed cardiac tamponade, and emergency ultrasound-guided subxiphoid-pericardiocentesis was performed. Classical findings in cardiac tamponade (Beck's triad) were present in our multiple-injured patient. Cardiac tamponade is a sequel of hemodynamic instability due to extrinsic cardiac compression from pericardial fluid. Up to 200 millitres can be fatal; about 180 millitres was aspirated from the index patient who achieved hemodynamic stability without surgical intervention. We highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis in acute cardiac tamponade."

    "title": "Predicting mortality and intensive care needs in geriatric trauma patients: A ROC analysis of frailty and trauma scoring systems.",
    "abstract": "The global increase in the geriatric population presents significant challenges for healthcare systems. Trauma, mainly resulting from falls, constitutes a primary cause of morbidity and mortality among older people. It is imperative to evaluate mortality risk and the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission among geriatric trauma patients to optimize clinical outcomes. This study aims to assess the efficacy of frailty and trauma scoring systems in predicting these critical outcomes. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Türkiye from September 2023 to October 2024. The study population consisted of geriatric patients (≥ 65 years) presenting blunt trauma. Comprehensive demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Mortality risk and ICU admission requirements were assessed utilizing various scoring systems: the Frailty Index (FI), Clinical Frailty Score (CFS), Trauma-Specific Frailty Index (TSFI), Shock Index (SI), Modified Shock Index (MSI), Age Shock Index (ASI), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Geriatric Trauma Outcome Score (GTOS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the predictive accuracy of these scores. The cohort comprised 350 patients with a median age of 74 years. The mortality rate observed was 11%, with non-survivors had significantly higher frailty and trauma scores compared to survivors (p < 0.001). Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was necessary in 20% of the cases. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed the GTOS and RTS exhibited the highest and identical Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, both recorded at 0.846. Furthermore, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for GTOS and RTS were 0.790-0.901 and 0.762-0.930, respectively, while the AUC for ICU admission requirements reached 0.830 (95% CI: 0.764-0.864) for RTS and 0.815 (95% CI: 0.755-0.876) for GTOS. Among the frailty scores, TSFI proved to be superior in predicting mortality, achieving an AUC of 0.805 (95% CI: 0.725-0.885), whereas the Frailty Index (FI) demonstrated the lowest predictive capacity for ICU needs, with an AUC of 0.666 (95% CI: 0.592-0.740). Frailty and trauma scoring systems serve as critical tools in predicting outcomes for geriatric trauma patients. The Revised Trauma Score and the Geriatric Trauma Outcome Score have demonstrated the highest reliability in forecasting both mortality and the need for ICU admissions. While the Trauma-Specific Frailty Index has exceeded other frailty indices in terms of mortality prediction, the Frailty Index exhibits limited utility for ICU evaluations. Integrating these scoring systems into clinical practice can significantly enhance the identification of high-risk patients and improve care strategies."

    "abstract": "Emergency medical service (EMS) professionals are increasingly using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) into the prehospital management and triage of critically ill patients. However, few institutions offer organized POCUS training for this community. Our goal was to offer and evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based POCUS course for EMS professionals. We developed and implemented an eight-hour course to train EMS providers in the fundamentals of POCUS for blunt trauma patients. The course design included lectures, standardized patients hands-on scanning, simulation-based ultrasound cases, clinical cases based on real patients, and an end-of-course review game. Before the day of the course, participants were assigned e-learning modules on the fundamentals of POCUS and on the Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma Exam (eFAST). The effectiveness of the course was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's methodology for Level 1 (course evaluation by participants) and Level 2 (pre- and post-course knowledge assessments including image interpretation). Pre- and post-knowledge scores were presented using means and ranges. Percent improvements and a paired sample t-test with the effect size (Cohen's d) were used to compare pre-post improvements. For course evaluation ratings, the mean Likert scale rating was calculated. A total of 128 learners (103 paramedics, 22 flight nurses, and one EMS physician from 32 EMS agencies, as well as two United States Army medics, completed the course. The average age of participants was 39.0 years, and 98 (76.6%) were male. The pre-course assessment mean knowledge score was 67.6% (95% CI 64.7-70.5). The post-course mean knowledge score was 89.0% (95% CI 87.3-97.0), resulting in a 21.4% point increase (p <.001; Cohen's d = 1.52). We received 122 course evaluations. Participants expressed nearly unanimous strong agreement across all measures, with a mean rating ranging from 4.8 to 4.9 on a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. Our data suggests that an 8-hour POCUS course, incorporating e-learning and simulation, can significantly improve EMS providers' knowledge of the fundamentals of POCUS and image interpretation of eFAST examination in trauma patients. Course evaluation results are highly supportive of this course's benefits. As EMS agencies increasingly incorporate POCUS for patient care, effective and efficient training methodologies will be critical for successful implementation. Our course offers one approach as part of a comprehensive training program. Further studies should assess POCUS utilization and sustained knowledge retention. Not applicable."

    "abstract": "Blunt trauma can cause significant vascular injury even in the absence of fractures or penetrating wounds, and such injuries are often underdiagnosed. In this case, the rarity lies in the intraoperative identification of an unusually extensive thrombus measuring 71 cm in length - an exceptional finding rarely described in blunt vascular trauma. We report a case of a 59-year-old male who sustained trauma to the left groin from a motorcycle handlebar impact during a road traffic accident. He presented six hours after the incident with absent distal pulses and delayed capillary refill in the affected limb. Computed tomography angiography revealed complete non-opacification of the left common femoral artery and proximal superficial femoral artery over a 4.4 cm segment, suggestive of arterial thrombosis. Emergency surgical exploration confirmed the thrombus, which was successfully extracted using a Fogarty catheter. The contused arterial segment was resected, and a tension-free end-to-end anastomosis was completed using a 6-0 Prolene suture. Based on clinical assessment, the limb ischemia was classified as Rutherford Grade IIa, indicating a marginally threatened limb requiring prompt intervention. Postoperatively, limb perfusion was restored with no signs of ischemic complications, and the patient regained full function. At six-week follow-up, triphasic flow was confirmed on Doppler ultrasound. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for vascular injury in blunt trauma patients, particularly when skeletal injury is absent. Early diagnosis and timely surgical management are vital to prevent limb loss and ensure favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) represents a vascular emergency in which the accurate delineation of surgical margins during laparotomy is pivotal for optimizing patient outcomes. The current diagnostic limitations underscore the need for a noninvasive, real-time modality capable of precisely identifying viable intestinal tissue to mitigate postoperative complications such as short bowel syndrome and sepsis. This study investigates the efficacy of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in assessing intestinal viability and accurately guiding resection margins during laparotomy procedures for AMI. Intraoperative diffuse reflectance spectral data were collected from healthy, ischemic, and anastomotic segments of the intestine in a cohort of seven patients. Hemoglobin absorption spectra were analyzed to calculate the absorption ratio at 577 nm-560 nm (A(577)/A(560)), serving as an indicator of tissue oxygen saturation. The percentage decrease in oxygenation between healthy and ischemic tissues (ΔStO2%) was subsequently quantified and correlated with histopathological findings to determine the optimal margins for surgical resection. A significant correlation was observed between ΔStO2% values and histopathological Chiu scores, effectively discriminating between ischemic and nonischemic intestinal tissues (P = 0.001). A ΔStO2% threshold of 12.3 ± 2.6% was identified as the critical value for defining surgical resection margins, corresponding to a Chiu score of 2, indicating the necessity for tissue excision. DRS has demonstrated significant potential as an intraoperative adjunct in the real-time determination of resection margins during AMI surgeries. By providing objective and quantifiable parameters, DRS has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes."

    "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic detachment of the lateral abdominal muscle group from the iliac crest occurs as a result of the acceleration mechanism when the body impacts a seatbelt during a head-on collision of motor vehicles. Due to the rare and variable nature of such defects, a standard treatment protocol has not yet been developed. As a result, the surgical technique and timing of the procedure are always planned individually. The optimal surgical method and type of implant for such cases remain undetermined. Given the anatomical location of the defect, surgical intervention utilizes techniques at the intersection of orthopaedics, reconstructive surgery, and herniology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic separation of the lateral abdominal muscles from the iliac crest, caused by blunt trauma, is a rare and complex injury. This study aims to present a novel surgical technique for managing such defects, focusing on the use of macroporous mesh fixation to the iliac crest with a ProTack stapler (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; This paper describes the case of a patient with a traumatic detachment of the lateral abdominal muscle group from the iliac crest. The diagnosis was based on physical examination and computed tomography (CT). The surgery was performed 12 months after the initial injury and emergency surgical treatment of abdominal organs. Due to the size of the defect, an open approach was proposed. Adhesions were released, the preperitoneal space was dissected, and a macroporous implant measuring 26 × 28 cm was placed and fixed to the iliac crest using a ProTack stapler (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). The lateral abdominal muscles were reattached to the mesh to restore anatomical continuity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Postoperatively, subcutaneous drainage was maintained for 9 days, and the use of a hernia belt was recommended continuously for 2 weeks, followed by 4 weeks during periods of increased physical activity. The patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. Primary wound healing and a satisfactory functional and aesthetic restoration of the abdominal wall were achieved. During a 12-month follow-up period, no hernia recurrence or other complications were observed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic detachment of the lateral abdominal muscle group is an extremely rare and serious medical condition. Randomized studies comparing approaches and surgical methods have not yet been conducted, and no standard treatment protocol has been established. The proposed treatment method, involving implant fixation to the bone using a stapler, appears to be a favorable therapeutic solution. Further experimental studies are needed to optimize the method and establish evidence-based guidelines."

It allows for rapid access to the thoracic cavity and treatment of the underlying pathology. Survival following traumatic cardiac injury relies on a near-impeccable combination of rapid assessment by properly trained emergency medical services personnel, rapid transport to a capable emergency center, accelerated access to the thoracic cavity within 10 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation initiation, and excellent perioperative resuscitation. Overall survival rate following resuscitative thoracotomy in the United States is 9.6%. In addition, not all who survive make an acceptable neurocognitive recovery, with one large meta-analysis quoting only 92.4%. We report on two patients who survived and made a complete neurocognitive recovery following emergency department thoracotomy secondary to penetrating cardiac trauma. Both patients were discharged from the hospital within 16 days of their emergency department thoracotomy."

    "abstract": "Firearms are the leading cause of pediatric death in the U.S., with a rising number of firearm-related injuries presenting to Pediatric Emergency Departments (PED). Trauma centers that manage firearm injuries have higher rates of weapon confiscation. Many healthcare workers have encountered concealed firearms in the ED, despite a lack of workplace firearm handling training. To address this gap, this technical report describes a novel simulation-based curriculum for Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) trainees involving a 15-year-old male presenting with a gunshot wound (GSW) to the chest requiring chest decompression, intubation, and blood products. A concealed firearm discovered on the patient required proper handling protocols. Afterward, a debrief was conducted, and participants completed an evaluation based on pre- and post-simulation knowledge using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree). Learners rated the simulation as highly relevant (Mean (M) = 4.8) and realistic (M = 4.7) and reported improvements in teamwork and communication skills (M = 4.6). They also demonstrated increased comfort with identifying firearm injury patterns (pre M = 4.2, post M = 4.6), stabilizing critically ill trauma patients (pre M = 4.1, post M = 4.4), handling firearms in a healthcare setting (pre M = 3.4, post M = 4.3), and functioning effectively as a team in the trauma bay (pre M = 4.5, post M = 4.6). This simulation was well received and provided a psychologically safe environment for trainees to address key knowledge gaps and improve comfort with firearm-related trauma care and safety practices in the pediatric emergency department."

This cross-sectional study was performed on trauma patients admitted to the University Medical Center Utrecht, a level-1 trauma center, during a one-year period. All adult (≥ 16 years) trauma patients who underwent chest radiography in the trauma bay and were subsequently admitted to the hospital were eligible. Patients with non-blunt trauma, initial primary survey in another center, or initial chest radiography obtained outside the shock room were excluded. Patients were categorized as hemodynamically and respiratory compromised or non-compromised patients, and based on symptoms of chest injuries. Descriptive analyses were used. This study included 780 patients, with a median age of 51 years (IQR 32-68), and 66.2% were male. Comorbidities (ASA 3-4) were seen in 12.8% and the median ISS was 10 (IQR 5-18). There were 382 hemodynamically and respiratory non-compromised patients without symptoms of chest injuries, of whom 255 underwent a subsequent chest CT. No acute interventions were performed in these patients. In symptomatic but hemodynamically and respiratory non-compromised patients (n = 289) there were 15 (5.2%) non-urgent chest tube placements prior to CT.

Blunt testicular injury is often due to motor vehicle accidents or contact sports where scrotal protection is not regularly worn, such as basketball or soccer. Several hours after initially being struck in the left testicle by a fiberglass pole while vaulting, a 23-year-old man presented to the emergency department for testicular pain and swelling. Scrotal edema and ecchymosis were found on physical examination. Ultrasound findings showed a hydrocele with debris and structural changes within the testicle, suggestive of a testicular rupture. The patient was taken to the operating room for decompression of the hydrocele and further exploration. A testicular rupture was confirmed and repaired with partial resection of the seminiferous tubules. A follow-up appointment two weeks after surgery showed a well-healed incision without complication, and a semen analysis was completed at six weeks with normal results. This case exhibits a unique mechanism of action for testicular rupture due to the lack of track-and-field-related trauma reported within the literature. Rapid diagnostic and surgical treatment were vital in this case to reduce the risk of fertility concerns and orchiectomy. Emergency medical providers must have a high index of suspicion for testicular rupture, given the severe complications if such a diagnosis is missed despite unusual mechanisms of injury."

Generally localized on the left side, right-sided localization is rarer, and may be undiagnosed in the acute phase of trauma.. We report the case of a 26-year-old patient, with a history of abdominal trauma 3 weeks previously, admitted to the emergency department for acute right heart failure signs, in whom a thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed, showing massive herniation of the right lobe of the liver intra-thoracically through a right diaphragmatic hernia, with compression of the right cardiac chambers responsible for hemodynamic collapse. Diaphragmatic hernia (DH) can occur congenitally or as a result of trauma. Traumatic diaphragmatic hernia (TDH) accounts for approximately 1%-7% of major trauma cases and is often associated with high-impact injuries. TDH is caused when a blunt or penetrating trauma ruptures the diaphragm, allowing the abdominal organs to herniate into the thoracic cavity. Symptoms of TDH can differ considerably depending on the degree of herniation and associated lesions. Imaging is crucial to the diagnosis of TDH, with chest X-ray often the first imaging modality used. Findings may include elevation of the hemidiaphragm, abnormal gas in the chest or the presence of abdominal organs in the thoracic cavity. Management of TDH begins with an initial assessment and stabilization of the patient, in accordance with the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. In patients with respiratory distress, hemodynamic instability, signs of strangulation or intestinal ischemia, immediate surgical intervention is warranted, and is often performed by laparotomy or thoracotomy."

Among these, pseudoaneurysms caused by penetrating trauma, such as gunshot wounds, are particularly rare and clinically significant due to their potential for delayed presentation and high morbidity. We report the case of a 46-year-old male who sustained a gunshot wound to the left thigh. CT angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm with >50% transection of the popliteal artery. Urgent surgical repair with thrombectomy and polytetrafluoroethylene graft placement led to full neurovascular recovery. This case underscores the limitations of relying solely on clinical examination to rule out vascular injury, as distal pulses may remain intact despite significant arterial compromise. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and promptly employ imaging, especially CT angiography, in any equivocal or evolving limb trauma. The delayed onset of ischemic and neurological signs highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion and utilizing CT angiography in equivocal cases. Prompt recognition and surgical intervention, supported by advances in imaging techniques and vascular graft materials, are key to preventing irreversible damage and optimizing limb salvage outcomes."

    "abstract": "Trauma causes a state of hypercoagulability, and its presence is common early in the injury course. D-dimer (DD), considered a good screening tool for coagulation activation and higher plasma levels, has been associated with unfavorable outcomes. Hence, in trauma, measuring DD levels may help provide useful prognostic information. The aim of the study was to find whether DD levels at the time of admission can predict the outcome of patients. This prospective observational studied 205 adult patients of age group 18-60 years, presenting to trauma emergency within 24 h of injury and blood samples collected within this period. The primary outcome was to assess whether DD levels at admission predicted outcome. Association of DD levels with injury severity score, with blunt or penetrating trauma, time from injury to admission, and to hospital stay were secondary outcomes. A value of DD >250 ng/ml was considered elevated. The DD levels were significantly higher in patients who died than those who were discharged [2316.28 (384.5,3331.18) vs 498.03 (140,693), P = 0.001]. On receiver operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff value of 1793.35 ng/ml for serum DD was obtained with sensitivity and specificity values of 72.7% and 60.8%, respectively. The odds of death in patients were 5.87 [95% CI 1.67 to 20.51] times more when DD >1793.35 ng/ml (P = 0.002). Our study demonstrates that DD levels at admission were high among nonsurvivors compared to survivors. A cutoff value of more than 1793.35 ng/ml is associated with an unfavorable outcome."

    "abstract": "Splenic injuries are among the most frequently encountered conditions in abdominal trauma. In such cases, the treatment approach must be carefully determined based on the patient's hemodynamic stability, the severity of the injury, and the presence of associated intra-abdominal pathologies, typically requiring a choice between non-operative management (NOM) and surgical intervention. The decision-making process is primarily guided by hemodynamic status, injury grade, and imaging findings. This study evaluates clinical outcomes and the factors influencing treatment decisions in patients with splenic rupture who were referred from the emergency department to the general surgery unit. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 42 patients diagnosed with splenic injury between June 2023 and February 2025. Patients were divided into two groups: those who received NOM (n=29, 69.0%) and those who underwent operative management (OM) (n=13, 31.0%). Demographics, mechanisms of injury, hemodynamic status, laboratory results, imaging findings, transfusion requirements, length of hospital stay, and mortality rates were analyzed. Statistical comparisons were made using appropriate tests, with significance set at p<0.05. The mean age of patients was 38.3±19.4 years, with 76.2% being male. The leading cause of injury was vehicular accidents (47.6%), followed by falls (21.4%) and penetrating trauma (11.9%). Operative management was more common in sharp object penetrating injuries (SOPI) (15.4%) and gunshot wounds (7.7%). Hemodynamic instability was more frequent in the OM group compared to the NOM group (30.8% vs. 10.3%, p=0.149). Splenectomy was performed in 76.9% of surgical cases (p=0.003). Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed that Grade 1 injuries (55.2%) were predominant in the NOM group, while Grade 2 injuries (38.5%) were more common in the OM group (p=0.531). The OM group required more blood transfusions (2.6±3.0 units vs. 0.9±1.9 units, p=0.053) and had longer hospital stays (10.3±6.9 days vs. 5.7±4.9 days, p=0.042). Overall mortality was low (9.5%), with no significant difference between the groups (p=0.819). Non-operative management is the preferred approach for hemodynamically stable patients, offering favorable outcomes and shorter hospital stays. However, penetrating trauma and hemodynamic instability are strong predictors for surgical intervention. Early risk stratification and close clinical monitoring are essential in determining the most appropriate treatment strategy for splenic injuries."

    "title": "Demonstration of a Mechanical External Biventricular Assist Device for Resuscitative Thoracotomy.",
    "abstract": "Resuscitative thoracotomy, a high-risk procedure involving open heart massage, serves as a last resort for life-threatening conditions like penetrating chest wounds, severe blunt trauma, or surgery-related cardiac arrest. However, its success rate remains low, even when primarily carried out by highly trained specialists. This research investigates the potential of an external biventricular assist device (BiVAD). By replacing open heart massage with our BiVAD device during resuscitative thoracotomy, we aim to achieve sufficient cardiac output, maintain physiological pressure levels, and potentially improve patient survival in these critical situations. The proposed BiVAD system features a 3D printed patch design for direct cardiac attachment, an actuation device, and a vacuum pump. The straightforward design allows quick application in emergency situations. The BiVAD system was tested in an in vitro hydraulic mock circulation, utilizing a silicone heart. Three actuation modes were tested for proof-of-concept: manual patch actuation, standard cardiac hand massage, and utilizing full capabilities of our BiVAD patch system with actuation device operation. Overall performance was assessed on ventricular pressure and flow rate data. Focusing on achieving the optimal cardiac output of 1.5 L/min (critical for patient survival), we tested our patch system against cardiac hand massage at a fixed rate of 60 bpm. The results include raw and statistically evaluated flow rate and pressure measurements for both the left and the right ventricle. Notably, our BiVAD system not only achieved to operate in the range of required cardiac output but also significantly reduced peak pressure in both ventricles compared to standard cardiac hand massage. This initial evaluation using a silicone heart model demonstrates the potential of our BiVAD system to achieve sufficient cardiac output while reducing peak pressure compared to cardiac hand massage. Further development holds promise for effective cardiac support in resuscitative thoracotomy."

    "title": "Flail Chest as a Rare Manifestation of Single Rib Fracture: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Flail chest is defined by the fracture of 3 or more ribs at 2 or more sites, resulting in a segment of the chest wall that loses its mechanical integrity, creating a \"floating\" segment. It occurs in 5% to 13% of patients with chest wall injuries. A very rare form of flail chest, sternal flail, refers to the separation of the sternum from the hemithoraxes and is usually associated with multiple anterior cartilage or rib fractures. Contrary to common impression, it has more than 1 form and each varies in severity. A 44-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with blunt trauma. Imaging studies revealed a third rib fracture with flail chest on the right side, along with multiple rib fractures and a pneumothorax on the left. The lungs showed bilateral contusions. The patient also sustained compression fractures of the third and fifth thoracic vertebrae, a sternal fracture, and a nondisplaced distal radius fracture on the right. The clinical team inserted a chest tube into the left hemithorax to manage the pneumothorax. The patient remained stable and did not require mechanical ventilation. Oxygen therapy was administered via nasal cannula, accompanied by the administration of normal saline and analgesic treatment. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated mild lactic acidosis, whereas serial hemogram assessments revealed no clinically significant decline in hemoglobin levels. The patient was subsequently admitted to the department of thoracic surgery for conservative management and close observation, with no immediate indication for surgical intervention. Clinical course remained uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the seventh day in stable condition without complications. Flail chest may result from a single rib fracture in combination with a sternal fracture. Patients presenting with atypical manifestations of flail chest can be discharged without complications within a short period when early diagnosis, appropriate supportive care, and timely treatment are provided."

    "title": "A Rare Presentation of Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage Following a Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery.",
    "abstract": "Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a rare but potentially fatal condition characterized by bleeding into the retroperitoneal space, located behind the abdominal cavity. In postpartum women, case reports are the primary source of information regarding this rare presentation, which typically arises from uterine artery lacerations, uterine rupture, extension of vaginal hematomas, or, in extremely rare instances, the rupture of ovarian artery aneurysms. Diagnosing a retroperitoneal hemorrhage can be particularly challenging due to its concealed location and the nonspecific nature of its symptoms, often leading to delayed recognition. The management of such bleeds presents additional difficulties, given that surgical access to the retroperitoneal space is complex, and the bleeding may spontaneously tamponade over time. Furthermore, current knowledge of retroperitoneal hemorrhage management is largely based on cases secondary to trauma, which are more common. This knowledge may not always be directly applicable to postpartum spontaneous hemorrhages, making the management of this condition even more complex. As such, it is crucial to document and report these cases to enhance our understanding of postpartum spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhages. By doing so, we aim to improve early detection and refine management strategies, ultimately reducing maternal morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. This case describes a 32-year-old woman who presented two days after a spontaneous vaginal birth with a large retroperitoneal bleed secondary to a ruptured ovarian artery aneurysm. She arrived at a rural emergency department in hemorrhagic shock, with a CT scan confirming retroperitoneal bleeding. The patient was urgently transferred to a tertiary center, where exploratory laparotomy was considered. However, she was successfully managed with gelfoam angioembolization and closely monitored with serial imaging."

Although benign, DTs exhibit local invasion and recurrence and may present sporadically or with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome. The clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic abdominal masses to severe complications such as bowel obstruction and perforation. This case report highlights a 46-year-old male with acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforation of a mesenteric fibromatosis (MF). Imaging revealed a large mesenteric mass causing bowel perforation, necessitating an urgent exploratory laparotomy. Surgical intervention entailed resection of the affected small bowel and mesentery with temporary stoma formation. Histopathology confirmed MF with negative margins, and the patient was discharged in stable condition. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in managing such complex cases, the challenges in diagnosing and treating intra-abdominal DTs, and the role of surgical resection with careful postoperative monitoring despite recurrence concerns."

It mostcommonly affects the distal ileum and is more prevalent in elderly patients. We present the case of a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was admitted with vomiting and abdominal distension for 72 hours. CT imaging revealed pneumobilia, intestinal obstruction, and an ectopic gallstone, consistent with Rigler's triad. The gallstone, measuring 3 × 2 cm, was located 130 cm distal to the Treitz ligament. The patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy with enterolithotomy, successfully removing the gallstone. Postoperatively, the patient recovered uneventfully, with complete resolution of symptoms. Gallstone ileus should be considered in elderly patients with intestinal obstruction, and early diagnosis using CT imaging is crucial for guiding treatment. Enterolithotomy remains the preferred surgical intervention with favorable outcomes in most cases."

    "abstract": "Kidney transplantation represents a critical intervention for end-stage renal disease on a global scale. Many women of childbearing age who have received a kidney transplant express a significant desire to conceive. Nevertheless, the occurrence of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) following kidney transplantation remains infrequent. A 32-year-old woman, who had undergone kidney transplantation nine years prior and IVF-ET six months ago, presented with abdominal pain. During her hospital stay, she suddenly experienced severe abdominal and chest pain. An abdominal CT angiography revealed a ruptured splenic artery aneurysm with pseudoaneurysm formation, necessitating an emergency exploratory laparotomy and subsequent splenic artery aneurysmectomy. Following the surgery, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hemodynamic stabilization, continuous monitoring of fetal heart rate and movement, adjustment of her immunosuppressive regimen, and targeted health education including personalized guidance on immunosuppressive drug management, recognition of pregnancy complications, and fetal monitoring. On the third day in the ICU, with her vital signs stabilized, the patient was transferred to the obstetric ward for further management. In the end, She was successfully maintained until 36 weeks of gestation and delivered a healthy neonate via cesarean section without complications. This case report presents the occurrence and management of a splenic artery rupture at 24 weeks of gestation following IVF-ET after kidney transplantation. This case highlights the critical role of multidisciplinary management, individualized fetal monitoring, and optimized immunosuppressive therapy in addressing life-threatening vascular complications in pregnant kidney transplant recipients, providing a valuable reference for similar clinical scenarios.

The most common causes of abdominal compartment syndrome include trauma, burns, and acute pancreatitis. Gynecologic etiologies rarely cause abdominal compartment syndrome, especially in the setting of tumor rupture or hemorrhage. We present an unusual presentation of abdominal compartment syndrome and associated posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) caused by a ruptured mixed germ cell tumor. A 26-year-old female presented with abdominal pain, a large abdominopelvic mass measuring 15 × 22 × 27 cm and elevated tumor markers concerning for an ovarian germ cell tumor. During admission, the patient developed hemodynamic instability, PRES, acute kidney injury, and elevated intravesical pressure consistent with abdominal compartment syndrome. She underwent emergent surgical decompression with an exploratory laparotomy, tumor debulking, and unilateral oophorectomy. Final pathology confirmed stage IIIC1 mixed germ cell tumor. Postoperatively, she received six cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin therapy (BEP). She has remained disease-free since completion of treatment, now totaling three years. This case demonstrates a rare presentation of a newly diagnosed ovarian malignancy and highlights the rapid decompensation of patients with abdominal compartment syndrome. Acute surgical intervention is critical for survival, and prioritization of patient stability over extensive debulking reflects the nuanced intraoperative decision-making that is required in high-risk scenarios. Early recognition and coordination of care are important in effectively managing compartment syndrome in patients with gynecologic malignancies. Although uncommon, abdominal compartment syndrome should remain in the differential diagnosis for patients with acute decompensation and a large abdominopelvic mass."

    "abstract": "Tube thoracostomy is used as the first-choice surgical treatment method for thoracic injuries. Today, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is performed for diagnostic and treatment purposes in patients who cannot be treated with tube thoracostomy. This study aim to evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic processes of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and to determine the most appropriate time for the operation. We evaluated 696 patients with blunt and penetrating thoracic injuries and analyzed data from 56 patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. 25 (44.6%) of the patients had blunt trauma and 31 (55.4%) had penetrating trauma. Seven (12.5%) of the patients underwent late video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, 17 (30.4%) of the patients underwent early video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and 32 (57.1%) of the patients underwent urgent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. It is seen that there has been a statistically significant relationship between the periods during which video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed and the injuries detected during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (p = 0.016). A statistically significant difference has also been found between the periods when video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was performed and the operation time, the number of patients receiving blood transfusion, and hospital stay (p = 0.001) (p = 0.001) (p = 0.012). It was determined that early video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery decreased the operation time, the need for blood transfusion and the length of hospital stay. Deciding correctly that tube thoracostomy is not effective in the treatment and making the decision to perform video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery at the earliest possible time in patient follow-up may prevent possible morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Emergency thoracotomy (ET) is a life-saving procedure performed during emergency resuscitation of patients in extremis. The controversy around such an invasive and resource-consuming procedure still lingers after so many years of its introduction. ET can serve as one of several indicators of trauma center efficiency and with information about the trauma system's overall preparedness, resources, and training. Our goal was to examine the clinical determinants of improved outcomes and review our ET experience over the past 8 years. All patients who underwent ET during the study period from January 2014 to December 2021 at our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients in whom the time of arrest was not known or who had incomplete data were excluded. Also, patients with fixed, dilated pupil on arrival with a significant blunt trauma were excluded. Patients undergoing urgent thoracotomy (not as a part of primary survey/resuscitation) were also not included in the study. All data were collected from the prospectively maintained hospital registry and patient case files. The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality and various parameters affecting it including but not limited to patient demographics, prehospital information, injury characteristics and scores, parameters of primary survey and perioperative data. The secondary outcome measures were the clinical spectrum of injury in patients with torso trauma who underwent ET including complications. The data was analysed using Fisher's exact test, Chi-square test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test based on the category of variables. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted on relevant factors which determined clinical outcomes. Sixty-seven patients underwent ET, with the majority (94.0%) being young males with a median age of 27 years. Penetrating injuries (61.2%) were more common than blunt trauma. Overall survival was 46.3%, with the best outcomes seen with penetrating stab (61.1%) injuries and patients with isolated intrathoracic injuries (67.5%). Patients who underwent resuscitative thoracotomy had dismal outcomes (mortality: 100%). On arrival, hemodynamic parameters like airway status, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, signs of life, and shock at presentation are statistically significant predictors of mortality (p < 0.05). The log-rank test for equality of survivor functions revealed the mechanism of injury (p = 0.010), the status of the airway (p = 0.002), shock on presentation (p = 0.001), and initial GCS (p = 0.040) to be significantly associated with mortality. ET can be a life-saving procedure with good outcomes, provided a careful selection of patients based on the mechanism of injury, location of major injury, and signs of life. It is prudent to have a system with proper protocol and a swiftly acting trauma team performing it to optimize the outcomes."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors to affect the digestive tract. These tumors arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal. Although the majority of GISTs occur in the stomach, they can arise anywhere along the GI tract, including the small intestine, colon, esophagus, and very rarely from extra intestinal locations. GISTs mainly affect older adults, with a slight male preponderance. Small size GISTs can be discovered incidentally during imaging or endoscopy. Symptoms vary depending on the location and size of the tumor, those related to the tumor mass effect (abdominal pain, discomfort, distension and a palpable mass), or others presenting with anemia and GI hemorrhage. Contrast-enhanced abdomino-pelvic CT scan is the investigation of choice for staging and follow-up. GISTs are distinguished from other tumors using immunohistochemical test positivity for CD 117and CD 34. Surgery is the standard treatment for localized GISTs followed by risk stratification. Adjuvant imatinib should be considered in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs. Here we describe a series of GISTs presenting at atypical locations, unique presentations, and atypical histologic variants. The first case was a 35-years old female patient who underwent an emergency laparotomy for small bowel obstruction and later diagnosed to have a mesenteric GIST (an extraintestinal GIST). The second case was a 60-year-old male patient who underwent an emergency laparotomy for a small bowel obstruction secondary to an intrabdominal mass and later diagnosed to have a jejunal GIST. The third case was a 72 years old male patient who underwent exploratory laparotomy for gastro-gastric intussusception secondary to gastric GIST. The fourth case was a 55 years old male patient who underwent exploratory laparotomy for gastric GIST with liver secondaries. In immunohistochemistry examination, all were positive for CD 117. Clinical presentation of GISTs depend on the tumor size and location. Small tumors are usually asymptomatic. If symptomatic, the most common clinical manifestations are features of anemia, GI bleeding, compressive symptoms, and intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis of GIST is confirmed using tissue histology and immunohistochemistry tests. Even though GIST constitutes the smallest portion of GI neoplasms, physicians need to have high index of suspicion for it in patients presenting with vague abdominal pain and consider abdominopelvic CT as part of patients' work up."

    "abstract": "Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) is a common commensal bacterium of the upper respiratory tract, with nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) increasingly recognized as a cause of invasive infections. Although purulent pericarditis itself is a rare but life-threatening condition, cases caused by NTHi are exceptionally rare, with only a few reported worldwide. We report a case of a 63-year-old immunocompromised woman with a history of hematologic malignancy and prior Hib vaccination who developed NTHi-associated purulent pericarditis and septic shock. She initially presented with dyspnea and fever and was found to have cardiac tamponade requiring emergency pericardiocentesis. Despite initial improvement, she deteriorated with septic shock and severe pneumonia, necessitating mechanical ventilation. Blood and pericardial fluid cultures confirmed NTHi infection. Given persistent systemic inflammation and high risk of constrictive pericarditis, she underwent surgical pericardiectomy, which led to clinical recovery and successful discharge. NTHi as a causative agent is exceedingly uncommon, with very few cases reported in the literature. The increasing incidence of invasive NTHi infections highlights the need for greater clinical awareness, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Pyogenic pericarditis has a high mortality rate, requiring prompt diagnosis and intervention. Our case supports prior observations that H. influenzae-associated pericarditis may be unresponsive to drainage alone, with pericardiectomy playing a critical role in infection control and prevention of constrictive pericarditis. This case underscores the importance of early recognition of invasive NTHi infections and highlights the potential necessity of early surgical intervention in H. influenzae-associated purulent pericarditis. Clinicians should consider H. influenzae as a causative agent in bacterial pericarditis and recognize the need for early, aggressive management to optimize patient outcomes."

This can lead to small bowel obstruction, bowel incarceration, and strangulation. We present a rare case of an adult patient presenting with an acute abdomen caused by small bowel strangulation due to a congenital transmesenteric defect. A 67-year-old female without any significant past medical or surgical history presented to the emergency department with an acute-onset worsening abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination revealed pain out of proportion to palpation of the abdomen. CT demonstrated internal hernia with moderate-volume ascites, concerning for ischemic bowel. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which demonstrated an internal hernia through a congenital mesenteric defect in the right hemiabdomen near the root of the mesentery with ischemic small bowel requiring resection. The patient was left in intestinal discontinuity and was returned for reexploration of the abdomen, open cholecystectomy, and right hemicolectomy. The patient's recovery and hospital course were uncomplicated, and she was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day five. The incidence of congenital mesenteric defects in adults is exceedingly low, resulting in a limited body of literature addressing their clinical presentation and complications. Timely and accurate preoperative diagnosis is critical to prevent acute obstruction and strangulation of the bowel.

A CT scan revealed an abnormal ileocolic configuration with intussusception of the distal ileal loop through the cecum causing a high-grade small bowel obstruction. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy to relieve the small bowel obstruction caused by the intussusception. A mass was identified intraoperatively which was originating from the terminal ileum. Pathological analysis determined the mass to be Burkitt lymphoma. When adult intussusception is identified, there must be a low index of suspicion for a malignant cause.

    "abstract": "Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is present in ∼20% of adults and is associated with cryptogenic stroke, recurrent transient neurological deficit, decompression illness, and migraines. In patients with high probability of a PFO-related ischaemic event, the preferred management strategy is the endovascular closure of the PFO, whenever feasible. Cardiac erosion or perforation is an unusual event after the interventional closure of a PFO, but its occurrence portends a life-threatening potential. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this serious complication when faced with acute cardiac tamponade in a patient with a history of PFO closure. We report the case of a 57-year-old man, with a recent PFO-related ischaemic stroke, who presented for elective endovascular closure of the PFO. Patent foramen ovale and surrounding structures seemed amenable for closure, and recommended a 25-mm Amplatzer device. Isolated dilation of the aortic bulb was noted by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), but with normal valve morphology and no aortic regurgitation. The procedure was performed without complications, and 24 h echo follow-up showed no impingement of the device on the surrounding structures. However, 36 h after the procedure, the patient developed sudden chest pain and cardiac tamponade. Emergency cardiac surgery with intra-operative TEE guidance revealed right atrial and aortic bulb perforation caused by the larger right disc of the occluder. The device was removed, and the defects were sutured. The patient was discharged within 14 days after the event, with no further complications. Perforation of the aortic root is a very rare complication after interventional PFO closure. This complication usually occurs at a long distance after the procedure, and is associated with oversized devices, deficient or absent aortic rim, or misalignment of the defect with the aorta. Our patient presented none of the above, but a moderate dilation of the aortic bulb, which might have triggered the rapid erosion and perforation."

    "abstract": "The duplication of the left anterior descending coronary artery and coronary artery-to-pulmonary artery fistulae are infrequent congenital anomalies described in literature. These anomalies can lead to life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction, rupture, cardiac tamponade, and heart failure. A 73-year-old male with chronic kidney failure was admitted for a preoperative cardiovascular assessment. Initially, he did not report any chest pain. However, while awaiting myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, he developed chest pain and coughing, leading him to present to the emergency department, where his troponin levels were found to be elevated. Coronary angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography showed a dual left coronary artery where one of the left anterior descending arteries completely transforms into a congenital aneurysm and fistula. In order to reshape the aneurysm neck and prevent the migration of coils into the left main coronary artery by creating a landing zone and to reduce the number of coils and the procedure time, two stents were first placed inside the aneurysm neck. Then, the fistula and aneurysm were successfully closed by coil implantation. Some case studies and centre experiences recommend interventional closure using cover stents, vascular plugs, and coil embolization techniques for symptomatic fistulae and those resulting in complications. Despite these recommendations, determining the best treatment strategy remains challenging due to the lack of clear guidelines. The novel modified technic consisted of two nested stents and coil embolization to close the aneurysm and fistula and prevent secondary complications due to myocardial infarction."

It leads to coagulopathy, impaired immune response, and higher morbidity, with mortality rates rising by 25% after its onset among severely injured trauma patients. This study sought to determine the factors associated with hypothermia and its response to resuscitation among major trauma patients at St. Francis Hospital Nsambya. This was a prospective observational study among 99 adult major trauma patients admitted to the emergency department at St. Francis Hospital Nsambya between November 2022 and April 2023. Patients were consecutively enrolled upon arrival and their temperatures were taken using the Braun infrared tympanic thermometer. A pretested data abstraction tool collected information on demographics, injury characteristics, and pre-admission events. The primary outcome was the prevalence of hypothermia. Data analysis was conducted using STATA Version 17.0, employing multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine factors associated with hypothermia. A total of 99 trauma patients were included in the study, of which 39(39%) were hypothermic on hospital arrival. The majority were males, 78(78.8%) aged 26 to 45 years, 49(49.5%) (range: 27-52). Blunt trauma was the most common mechanism of injury 9(86.9%), followed by penetrating injuries 9(9.1%). Hypothermia was associated with age (Adjusted Odds Ratios [AOR]: 19.94, CI: 1.6-248.65, p = 0.02), body region injured (AOR = 6.28, CI: 1.6-27.75, p = 0.015), ambient temperature (AOR = 0.09, CI: 0.01-0.6, p = 0.012), and warm clothing (AOR = 0.05, CI: 0.01-0.39, p = 0.004). After 30 min of resuscitation, most patients had transitioned from a hypothermic state to a normothermic state, according to initial temperature measurements. This resuscitation involved keeping the patients warm using blankets and external warming devices and administering heated intravenous fluids. Hypothermia affected 39% of major trauma patients, with advanced age and injured regions as key associations. Routine temperature monitoring, especially for older patients and those with extremity injuries, is essential. Hospitals should implement standardized hypothermia prevention protocols, ensure adequate warming equipment, and train healthcare providers in early detection and management. Further research is needed to optimize warming techniques and resuscitation strategies in trauma care."

    "abstract": "Feeding jejunostomy is performed commonly following esophagectomy to ensure postoperative nutritional support. However, it can occasionally lead to rare complications, such as intussusception. Adult intussusception, especially secondary to a feeding jejunostomy, is an uncommon occurrence. Timely diagnosis and surgical intervention are essential to treat this potentially life-threatening condition. We report a 69-year-old male, who has received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by a thoraco-laparoscopic Ivor Lewis esophagectomy and a feeding jejunostomy. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. However he presented with acute abdominal symptoms at 6 weeks. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed intussusception at the site of the feeding jejunostomy. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, where the diagnosis was confirmed, and resection and anastomosis of the involved bowel segment was performed. This case highlights a rare complication of jejunostomy-induced intussusception. A high index of suspicion and prompt surgical management are crucial to prevent adverse outcomes in such cases."

    "abstract": "Ladd's procedure is the standard surgical intervention for intestinal malrotation. Although generally curative, rare cases of early postoperative complications, including adhesions or recurrent volvulus, can necessitate reoperation. We present the case of a full-term newborn girl who underwent emergent Ladd's procedure on Day 3 of life for malrotation with volvulus. She was discharged on postoperative Day 17 but returned the following day with recurrent bilious emesis. Imaging suggested partial obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy revealed recurrent volvulus with two twists at the duodenojejunal junction, which was successfully reduced. The patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative Day 8. This case underscores the importance of clinical vigilance in detecting rare postoperative complications following Ladd's procedure."

    "abstract": "We report a rare case of a four-year-old boy with small bowel obstruction caused by a trichobezoar. The initial diagnosis in the emergency department was acute gastroenteritis. The lack of improvement and the onset of bilious vomiting associated with abdominal distention raised the suspicion of bowel obstruction. Abdominal X-ray showed dilated loops of bowel, and a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a partially peripherally calcified mass containing debris as a cause of proximal small bowel obstruction. At exploratory laparotomy, a trichobezoar was visualized and removed, relieving the obstruction. The contents confirmed to be agglutination of ingested materials that are insoluble and consistent with hair. Trichobezoar, also known as a \"hairball,\" is described predominantly among females, often with a psychiatric history. We report a rare case of small bowel obstruction due to trichobezoar in a male toddler with no behavioral or psychiatric illnesses."

    "abstract": "Penetrating trauma to the neck poses a critical challenge in the emergency department. These wounds have the potential to lead to rapid blood loss, hemorrhagic shock, and an increase in mortality. Large academic tertiary centers typically have vast resources and consultants to allow for rapid assessment and treatment of penetrating neck trauma. In community emergency departments, this is not typically the case, as surgical backup is usually not readily available and lacks the additional subspecialty coverage to aid in the management of the trauma patient. This situation often necessitates innovative methods of achieving hemostasis in certain life-threatening situations. This report explores a novel approach, termed the \"slash pack,\" as a potential solution for managing such traumatic injuries. The report discusses two cases in which penetrating neck trauma was successfully managed with the slash pack technique in a community hospital for stabilization prior to the transfer of the patients to the regional tertiary trauma center. Both patients were stabilized and transferred to a level 1 trauma center for definitive care with complete resolution and no further sequelae from injury."

This report describes an eight-month-old female infant who was brought to the emergency department with a history of persistent crying, fever, vomiting, and one occurrence of currant jelly stool in the past 12 hours. A physical examination revealed abdominal distension, tenderness, and rigidity. An abdominal ultrasound indicated free intra-abdominal fluid containing micro-echoic elements. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, during which pus was found in the abdominal cavity. A perforated MD was identified, located 60 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. An enterectomy and end-to-end anastomosis were performed to remove the perforated diverticulum. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the infant was discharged on the eighth postoperative day. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a perforated MD with ectopic gastric mucosa. This report summarizes and characterizes the presentation, diagnosis, and management of this rare complication."

    "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) following traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) has been found to have limited effectiveness in the prehospital setting. While emergency medical services (EMS) initiated CPR following TCA is a common practice, variability exists due to differences in EMS perceived futility and survivability. These perceived differences have prevented the universal implementation of CPR following TCA. We hypothesized that some trauma patients may benefit from prehospital CPR following TCA. We sought to identify factors associated with survival in TCA patients. Retrospective cohort study of adult patients transported to our trauma center, after receiving CPR at the scene or in transit, from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2022. We compared patients who arrived at the ED with and without a pulse following CPR for TCA. Multivariate logistic regression identified interventions independently associated with having a pulse on ED arrival. 244 patients met inclusion criteria. 30% of patients had a pulse on ED arrival. No differences existed for age (41 vs. 40, p = 0.44), ISS (33 vs. 36, p = 0.20), air transport (13% vs. 19%, p = 0.14), male gender (81% vs. 77%, p = 0.51), or transport time (11 min vs. 15 min, p = 0.16). Differences existed for blunt mechanism (76% vs. 63%, p = 0.04), rates of prehospital thoracostomy (39% vs. 55%, p = 0.02), tourniquet (1% vs. 8%, p = 0.045), and defibrillation (17% vs. 7%, 0.02). Patients who arrived with a pulse had a 65% mortality. On multivariate logistic regression penetrating trauma and prehospital thoracostomy were independently associated with an increased likelihood of having a pulse on arrival. Patients who arrive to the ED with a pulse after prehospital CPR for TCA have a 35% chance of survival. Penetrating trauma and prehospital thoracostomy were independently associated with pulse on arrival, possibly indicating relief of tension pneumothorax."

Outcome mostly in blunt trauma is believed to be poor. Our aim was to identify all studies reported over the past fourteen years and compare reported outcomes for blunt trauma. We performed a systematic literature search according to PRISMA guidelines (from January 1st, 2010 to May 31st, 2024). Qualitative comparison of studies and outcomes was done. A total of 22 articles were included for an overall number of 6315 ERT for blunt trauma. Male-to-female distribution was 3:1. The collectively reported overall survival was 4.5%. Mean age varied from lowest at 32.4 years to highest at 53 years. Neurological outcome was reported in 6 of 21 studies; among this six publications, just one reported neurological outcome using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Heterogeneity in the studies prevented outcome analyses by formal quantitative meta-analysis. The reported outcome after ERT for blunt trauma is not favorable, with an extremely low survival rate highlighted in most studies. Multicenter, prospective, observational data are needed to validate the modern role of ERT in blunt trauma."

    "abstract": "Giant hydronephrosis (GH) is an uncommon urological disease most often identified and managed during infancy or childhood. Diagnosing GH prior to surgical intervention can be difficult, resulting in potential misdiagnoses as ovarian tumors or intraabdominal cystic masses. Management of GH depends on the underlying pathology and the renal function of the affected kidney. A 16-year-old girl presented to local clinics with a 1-month history of abdominal distention and irregular menstruation. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a 33-cm cystic mass occupying the entire abdomen and displacing the bowel posteriorly, suggesting a lymphatic malformation or an omental cyst. The patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy. A 33-cm cystic mass originating from the right retroperitoneum was discovered and removed without complications. Histopathologic examination showed atrophied renal parenchyma and a dilated renal pelvis, confirming GH. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 7 in good condition. GH is a rare urological condition that is difficult to diagnose preoperatively, often leading to potential misdiagnoses. Although GH is exceedingly rare in the pediatric population, we recommend including it in the differential diagnosis of large intraabdominal cystic masses in pediatric patients."

These fistulas can lead to clinical manifestations such as pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and septic shock. We report a case of purulent pericarditis and septic shock secondary to a hepatic-pericardial fistula in a patient with complex cardiac and oncologic history. A 76-year-old man with a history of pancreatic, renal cell and prostate cancer presented with acute chest pain and dyspnea. Initial investigations revealed a moderate pericardial effusion and a suspicious hepatic lesion. The patient developed cardiac tamponade and underwent emergency pericardiocentesis, draining 750 ml of purulent fluid. A CT-guided biopsy confirmed a hepatic abscess with fistulization to the pericardium. Despite antibiotic therapy and drainage procedures, the patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in septic shock and death. This case highlights the challenges in managing hepatic-pericardial fistulas, particularly in patients with significant comorbidities. Bacteroides fragilis was identified as the causative pathogen, which underscores the importance of timely identification and management of these rare infections. Early surgical intervention and targeted antibiotic therapy are critical, although prognosis remains poor in patients with compromised cardiovascular and respiratory status. Hepatic-pericardial fistulas, though rare, should be considered in patients with unexplained pericarditis or septic shock, particularly in the presence of hepatic abscesses. Early recognition, multidisciplinary management, and individualized treatment are essential to improve outcomes."

    "abstract": "Hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is a parasitic condition typically considered benign. However, the rupture of a hepatic hydatid cyst into the abdominal cavity is a rare and potentially fatal complication. This complication is particularly complex in cirrhotic patients, posing significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman with a history of poorly managed post-viral cirrhosis due to hepatitis C who presented with abdominal pain lasting for ten days. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the rupture of a hydatid cyst in the segment VIII of the liver, associated with a peritoneal reaction. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, confirming the rupture and allowing for the resection of the protruding cyst dome, followed by peritoneal lavage and drainage. No recurrence was observed during a six-month follow-up. Hydatid disease is endemic in Tunisia and poses a significant public health concern. Although rare (1 to 16 %), intraperitoneal rupture is a severe complication. CT is a key diagnostic tool, offering high sensitivity, especially for differential diagnoses. The management of this condition necessitates urgent surgical intervention, followed by medical treatment with albendazole to prevent recurrence. This case underscores the rarity of intraperitoneal rupture of a hydatid cyst and emphasizes the importance of considering this complication in the diagnosis of abdominal emergencies in endemic regions, as delayed diagnosis is associated with a particularly poor prognosis."

The objective of this study was to investigate the nature of abdominal trauma, ascertain associated injury characteristics, and identify independent factors associated with mortality in patients referred to a level-one trauma center located in the southern region of Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the largest trauma center in the southern region of Iran from June 2018 to June 2021. The study included all adult patients diagnosed with abdominal trauma based on the criteria outlined in the Abbreviated Injury Scale guidelines. Data were collected on patient characteristics, injury anatomy, injury mechanism, duration of hospitalization, blood pressure levels, injury severity, and outcomes. The study analyzed 844 cases among 4755 individuals admitted to the emergency department (17.75% prevalence) with an 18.40% mortality rate. Liver injuries were associated with increased mortality, while spleen injuries, although common, were not. Most patients were male, with an average age of 36. The most common causes were road traffic accidents and falls, with blunt trauma being predominant. Variables with observed association with mortality included age (p value < 0.001, OR = 1.057), GCS = 3-8 (p value < 0.001, OR = 10.780), retroperitoneal hemorrhage (p value < 0.001, OR = 3.052), higher ISS (p value < 0.001, OR = 1.039), and length of hospital stay (p value = 0.002, OR = 0.974). This study highlights the significant burden of abdominal trauma on mortality rates in traumatic patients.

    "abstract": "Vascular access is a critical component of care in the neonatal intensive care unit, especially for nutritional support and medication administration. While umbilical vein catheters are commonly used during the first few days of life, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) become the preferred method of central venous access thereafter. However, malpositioning of PICCs, particularly when the tip lies within or in close proximity to the right atrium, may lead to severe complications such as pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, especially in extremely low birth weight infants. Two extremely low birth weight preterm infants experienced sudden clinical deterioration following PICC insertion, raising concerns about catheter-related complications. Both infants were diagnosed with cardiac tamponade secondary to pericardial effusion caused by PICC malposition, with the catheter tip located in or near the right atrium. In both cases, emergency pericardiocentesis was attempted after echocardiographic confirmation of pericardial effusion and clinical signs of tamponade. Despite resuscitative efforts, both infants succumbed to the complication. The outcome was fatal in both cases and confirmed catheter malposition as the underlying cause of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. To prevent fatal complications such as cardiac tamponade, PICCs should be positioned in safe area. Proper placement in the superior vena cava should be confirmed and maintained. Regular verification of catheter tip position and minimizing unnecessary repositioning are essential for preventing catheter-related adverse events in vulnerable preterm infants."

Two patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma presented with large pericardial effusions and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The first patient was successfully managed with tumor-directed therapy alone. The second patient underwent emergency surgery following failed pericardiocentesis, resulting in cardiac arrest requiring mechanical circulatory support. These 2 cases highlight the critical decision making required when managing anterior mediastinal masses with pericardial effusion. Whereas guidelines typically recommend urgent drainage for significant effusions with tamponade physiology, this approach may be detrimental in the presence of anterior mediastinal masses. Emergency pericardiocentesis in the setting of malignant anterior mediastinal mass may confer greater risk than benefit. Systemic antineoplastic therapy is encouraged as first-line treatment to promote tumor reduction and mitigate compressive symptoms."

The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) derived and validated a CSI prediction rule to guide cervical spine imaging decisions in children after blunt trauma. Our objective was to determine the interrater reliability between EM providers and surgeons for history and physical examination findings used to evaluate children for CSI after blunt trauma. This was a planned secondary analysis of a prospective, observational multicenter study that enrolled children aged 0 year to 17 years evaluated for blunt trauma in 18 PECARN emergency departments (EDs). We collected data on injury mechanisms, history and physical examination findings, imaging ordered, and suspicion of CSI from EM and surgery providers. Kappa, prevalence, and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) were used to compare interrater reliability of variables associated with CSI. Surgeons cared for 8,041 of the 22,430 children enrolled in the parent study. About 18.6% (1494/8041) had data collection forms completed by both EM providers and surgeons and were included in the analysis. Agreement between EM and surgery providers per kappa was moderate (kappa 0.41-0.6) to substantial (kappa 0.61-0.8), while PABAK analyses showed substantial to almost perfect agreement for variables in the PECARN CSI prediction rule. There was agreement between EM and surgery providers in overall clinical suspicion for CSI in 64.2% (959/1494) of patients. Retrospective application of the PECARN Rule indicated that ED and surgical provider assessments would have led to the same imaging decision in 73.7% (1101/1494) of patients. We identified moderate to substantial agreement between EM providers and surgeons for clinical findings that comprise the PECARN Cervical Spine Injury Prediction Rule. Agreement between providers during shared decision-making will strengthen the use of the prediction rule and may lead to decreased cervical spine imaging in EDs.

This report presents an unusual case of spontaneous uterine rupture in a 29-year-old virgin, highlighting the critical importance of early diagnosis and intervention, even in the absence of typical risk factors. A 29-year-old nulliparous woman presented with acute onset of severe lower abdominal pain during menstruation. She had no history of sexual activity, uterine surgery, or trauma. A high index of suspicion for spontaneous uterine rupture was raised following a computed tomography (CT) scan. An emergent exploratory laparotomy revealed a rupture at the uterine fundus with extensive necrosis, necessitating a total hysterectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed adenomyosis with significant hemorrhage and vascular thrombosis, without evidence of infection or malignancy. Subsequent investigations identified protein-S deficiency, which may have contributed to a hypercoagulable state. This combination of factors led to localized ischemia and structural compromise of the uterine wall, ultimately leading to spontaneous rupture. This case underscores the importance of considering spontaneous uterine rupture in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in women, regardless of conventional risk factors. The coexistence of adenomyosis and protein-S deficiency might have synergistically contributed to uterine wall compromise and rupture. Early recognition and prompt intervention are essential to prevent severe complications, and evaluation for underlying coagulopathies should be considered to guide management and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes."

Sub-epicardial aneurysms are rare and can lead to cardiac tamponade and death. We discuss a rare case of a 42-year-old female with two large sub-epicardial aneurysms and coronary artery disease initially diagnosed as true aneurysm, highlighting the importance of surveillance and the challenges of using echocardiography to diagnose and manage these aneurysms effectively. These PSA are difficult to be differentiated form a true aneurysm with transthoracic echocardiography. Echocardiographic criteria, such as a neck-to-sac diameter ratio of less than 0.5 and a reduction in wall thickness near the aneurysmal neck by more than 50%, were considered valuable in differentiating these aneurysms. Now simultaneous bi-plane and real-time three-dimensional imaging features of trans-esophageal echo will aid echo cardiologists in better identifying the characteristics of the outpouching, to further aid in differentiating pseudo from true aneurysms and even recognize the stage of the sub-epicardial aneurysms. Subjecting the patient to a surgery also depends on the time of occurrence of the myocardial infarction. It is highly advocated that an urgent procedure should be conducted for left ventricle (LV) PSA found within the first 3 months after an infarction, since the onset of rupture is unforeseeable. Although an accurate separation between false and true aneurysms is foremost critical for appropriate management, this differentiation is often challenging clinically and radiologically even with reasonable experience."

Evidence on the safety of same-day discharge (SDD) after PVI, instead of overnight stay (ONS), is limited. This retrospective study uses data from PVI's performed between June 2018 and December 2020 in the Netherlands. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcome data, and healthcare utilization, extracted from two national databases, were compared between the implementation of an SDD protocol in a single center and a national benchmark where the majority is an ONS strategy. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed. We included data from 11,812 PVI's,1360 in the SDD protocol group, and 10,452 for the ONS benchmark. The SDD protocol group performed 57.7% of PVI's in SDD, while the benchmark performed 5.3% (p < 0.001). The SDD protocol group performed more cryoballoon PVI (90.8% vs. 39.2%, p < 0.001). There were no differences in bleeding (p = 0.830), thromboembolic (p = 0.893), vascular complications (p = 0.720), or cardiac tamponade (p = 0.634). Peri-procedural hospital stay was significantly shorter in the SDD protocol group (0.50 day vs. 1.52 days, p < 0.001), without a reallocation of health care to outpatient clinic (p = 0.230), emergency department (p = 0.132), or a higher rate of readmission (p = 0.092). The SDD protocol group with 57.7% SDD has similar complication rates and lower healthcare utilization, compared to the national ONS benchmark with 5.3% SDD, indicating that the SDD protocol is a safe and effective alternative for ONS in patients undergoing PVI.

    "abstract": "Motorcycle accidents often result in abdominal trauma in patients seeking emergency care. Injuries to the hollow viscera, including the duodenum, jejunum, urinary bladder, and colorectum, are relatively common. In contrast, owing to the protective function of the anterior rib cage, gastric rupture is exceptionally rare, with an incidence of < 1.7%. Gastric rupture typically occurs in the anterior wall and rarely presents as multiple ruptures. This report describes an unusual case of multiple gastric ruptures resulting from blunt trauma. A 21-year-old man, who was involved in a motorcycle collision at 70 km/hour after consuming a large meal, presented with hypotension. Physical examination revealed abdominal tenderness. Laboratory test results indicated elevated amylase, lipase, and liver enzyme levels. Computed tomography showed pneumoperitoneum, hemoperitoneum, and gastric wall discontinuation, suggesting gastric perforation alongside pancreatic, splenic, and hepatic injuries. Angiographic embolization was performed because of active contrast leakage in the left gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries. Emergency laparotomy revealed substantial blood loss, hematoma, and gastric contents scattered throughout the abdominal cavity. Two 10 cm gastric perforations in the anterior and posterior walls were identified, as well as severe liver damage, splenic injury, and pancreatic contusion. Surgical interventions included primary closure of the gastric wall, splenectomy, and partial hepatectomy. After temporary abdominal closure, the patient underwent a second surgery without further bleeding. The gastric repair site was resected and reinforced for optimal tissue healing. Gastric rupture following blunt trauma is fatal. However, patients without severe complications can recover through surgical interventions and postoperative care."

Emergent exploratory celiotomy revealed a septic abdomen with gross contamination due to perforation in the ascending colon near the hepatic flexure, which was not amenable to repair. At a minimum, a subtotal colectomy was required. The patient underwent a single-stage oncologic subtotal colectomy with a hand-sewn ileosigmoid anastomosis and fascial closure. Pathologic evaluation confirmed stage IIb invasive sigmoid adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 0/43 lymph nodes. The patient was discharged on postoperative day nine without complications. For patients presenting with abdominal sepsis from fecal contamination caused by large bowel perforation due to sigmoid malignancy and obstruction, surgical management options vary widely. These range from damage control surgery with multiple subsequent procedures to single-stage resection and anastomosis. This case underscores the importance of individualized, careful decision-making both preoperatively and intraoperatively. It highlights the factors to consider when evaluating the feasibility of single-stage oncologic surgery and the risks associated with performing a primary anastomosis during emergent operations."

    "abstract": "Intestinal knotting syndrome is a rare cause of bowel obstruction, and ileo-ileal knotting is the least common type. Prompt surgical management is required to prevent rapid clinical deterioration. We present the case of a 50-year-old woman from Mexico arriving at the emergency room with intense abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and mild abdominal distention. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, with the finding of a true ileo-ileal knot with ischemic bowel compromise. The etiology of ileo-ileal knotting is not well described, and it has not been linked to a specific age or sex. The surgical approach could vary between untying the knot if the affected loop is still viable or performing a resection en bloc with anastomosis if there are signs of necrosis or gangrene. Intestinal knotting is a diagnostic challenge usually confirmed at the time of the surgery. Surgeons must be aware of ileo-ileal knotting as a differential diagnosis for acute abdomen in order to operate on time, know when a resection is needed, and the right technique to perform in these cases."

    "abstract": "Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with hemorrhage accounting for approximately 40 % of trauma-related deaths. While early airway management is crucial for trauma patients requiring emergent surgery, the optimal timing and setting for intubation remain controversial. This study compares outcomes of trauma patients intubated in the Emergency Department (ED) versus the Operating Room (OR) prior to emergent hemorrhage control. We retrospectively analyzed adult trauma patients from the Israel National Trauma Registry (2013-2023) who underwent emergent hemorrhage control surgery. Patients requiring immediate ED intubation were excluded. Outcomes-including mortality, ICU admission, and ED blood transfusion-were compared between ED and OR intubation groups using multivariable logistic regression and exact matching. Of 1527 patients, 279 (18.3 %) were intubated in the ED and 1248 in the OR. Most were male (89.6 %), median age 29 years, with 69.8 % sustaining penetrating injuries. Exploratory laparotomy was performed in 53.2 %. After adjustment for confounders, ED intubation was independently associated with higher mortality (aOR 5.01, 95 % CI 1.68-17.05, p = 0.006), increased ICU admission (aOR 1.17, 95 % CI 2.34-4.31, p < 0.001), and greater need for blood transfusion (aOR 4.81, 95 % CI 3.51-6.61, p < 0.001). Exact matching for age, Injury Severity Score, hemodynamic status, and injury mechanism confirmed a trend toward higher mortality with ED intubation (aOR 3.10, 95 % CI 1.00-11.76, p = 0.065). For bleeding trauma patients, clinicians should prioritize volume resuscitation before intubation and minimize ED airway interventions unless clearly indicated."

The aim of this study is to analyse the demography, mode of presentation, grading, management, morbidity and mortality of these injuries at our centre. This is an ambispective study conducted on 31 patients over a period of five years, between October 1, 2019 and October 15, 2024. Most patients were male (93.5%). Blunt trauma was associated with the majority of cases (83.8%). Twenty-nine patients were hemodynamically stable on arrival at the trauma/emergency ward. Postoperative morbidity was around 32% in our study, whereas mortality was approximately 7%. Nonoperative management was followed in five cases of high-grade (Grade 4) pancreatic injury. One patient with Grade 5 pancreaticoduodenal injury underwent an emergency Whipple procedure. In our study, postoperative morbidity associated with delayed admission beyond 48 hours from the time of injury was statistically significant (p = 0.029). A high index of suspicion is needed in every case. Delayed diagnosis and treatment negatively impact morbidity and mortality. In selected cases of high-grade pancreatic injuries, conservative management with serial follow-up and imaging can be considered at a well-equipped tertiary care centre."

    "abstract": "Minoxidil is a direct-acting vasodilator that reduces systemic vascular resistance by opening adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels, leading to arteriolar smooth muscle vasodilation. While commonly prescribed for resistant hypertension and androgenic alopecia, minoxidil is associated with fluid retention, and in rare cases, pericardial effusion that can progress to cardiac tamponade. In this report, we present a case of an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who developed cardiac tamponade while on chronic minoxidil therapy for hypertension. He presented with progressive dyspnoea, lower extremity oedema, and fever. Imaging revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, and a confirmatory echocardiogram demonstrated a pericardial effusion with right ventricular collapse. The patient underwent urgent pericardiocentesis, yielding 545 ml of pericardial fluid. Infectious, malignant, and autoimmune aetiologies were ruled out, and minoxidil was identified as the likely cause. Following discontinuation of minoxidil, the patient's symptoms completely resolved, with no recurrence at 1-month follow-up. In addition, we reviewed 26 previously reported cases of minoxidil-induced pericardial effusion and/or cardiac tamponade, 17 of which are summarized in this report. This case demonstrates the rare but potentially fatal complication of therapy and emphasizes the importance of early detection and clinical vigilance, particularly in vulnerable populations such as patients with CKD. This case highlights minoxidil-induced cardiac tamponade - a rare but fatal adverse effect requiring urgent intervention, especially underrecognized in clinical practice.Patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for minoxidil-induced pericardial effusion due to altered fluid regulation and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation.Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider routine cardiac monitoring in minoxidil users, even for non-hypertensive indications such as hair loss."

We report a case of endocarditis on a PDA, complicated by multiple mycotic aneurysms, including a partially ruptured aneurysm of the pulmonary artery (PA) trunk. A 20-year-old female presented with progressive dyspnoea, worsening over 48 h, accompanied by fever. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, necessitating the drainage of 500 mL of haemorrhagic fluid. Imaging studies revealed a false aneurysm of the PA trunk, with contrast extravasation into the pericardial space. Blood cultures and pericardial fluid cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Emergency surgery involved resection of the aneurysm, ligation of the PDA, and pericardial drainage. The patient recovered after 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics and was discharged with good clinical and biological outcomes. This case illustrates the importance of early diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis associated with congenital heart defects, as the delay can result in severe complications such as aneurysm rupture."

We aimed to determine the sensitivity and negative predictive value of computed tomography (CT) for the identification of clinically significant cervical spine injuries (CSIs) in pediatric blunt trauma patients across a large health system. We hypothesized that CT would be highly sensitive for detecting CSIs across a diverse network of hospitals. A retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients younger than 18 years with trauma diagnosis codes who underwent CS imaging within 24 hours of presentation to an emergency department was conducted across a mixed adult and pediatric 23-hospital system from January 2012 through December 2023. A clinically significant CSI was defined as an injury requiring CS surgery or halo placement within 7 days of presentation. Patients who underwent CT and had a clinically significant CSI were compared with those without. A total of 14,232 pediatric trauma patients were evaluated with CS CTs. An additional 10,900 with minor trauma were screened with x-ray and no CT. Of patients who underwent CT, 109 (0.8%) had CSIs. On univariate analysis, CSI patients were more likely to be obtunded shown by an increase in intubation (19% vs. 5%, p < 0.001), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of <14 (22% vs. 6%, p = 0.049). Four patients with CSIs had normal CTs per initial radiographic report. Post hoc analysis by an expert spine panel identified abnormalities on all CTs. The sensitivity of CT for diagnosing CSI was 96%, and the negative predictive value was 100%. This was consistent across all age groups. Computed tomography has a high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant CSIs in pediatric trauma patients across all ages and a wide variety of hospitals. Consideration must be given to clearing the pediatric CS based on a negative CT in the absence of symptoms. Retrospective Cohort Study; Level IV."

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma and without intra-abdominal injuries (IAI) among FAST-positive patients. This retrospective study was conducted on children less than 17 years old who visited the emergency department because of trauma and underwent FAST between April 2010 and March 2014. FAST-positive children were categorized into groups with and without IAI and were subsequently compared. Ninety-two patients (60 boys) with a median age of 7 years were included. Seventy-six of them (82.6%) did not have IAI. The ratio of patients with abnormal abdominal surface findings, abdominal pain, and signs of peritoneal irritation was significantly lower in the group without IAI than in the group with IAI. The ratio of patients with ascites in the Morison and splenorenal pouches was lower in the group without IAI compared to the group with IAI (1% vs. 38%, p < 0.001; 3% vs. 19%, p = 0.030). Furthermore, the ratio of patients with ascites in the pelvic cavity was significantly higher in the group without IAI than in the group with IAI (92% vs. 75%, p = 0.0046; 91% vs. 50%, p < 0.001). In this study, false-positive FAST cases in pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma tend to lack abdominal findings.

Prompt diagnosis and timely intervention are critical to preventing complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, and sepsis. SBV can occur without a clear underlying pathology (idiopathic) or be associated with anatomical anomalies, such as Meckel's diverticulum (MD), accompanied by a meso-diverticular band (MDB). We report a rare case of SBV in an adult woman, resulting from MD complicated by the presence of an MDB. She presented with a two-day history of severe central abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and obstipation. Imaging revealed features consistent with SBV without definitive identification of the underlying cause preoperatively. Urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, identifying MD with MDB as the causative factors. The patient underwent small bowel resection and excision of MD along with the MDB. Surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of management for SBV, with early operative treatment crucial to minimizing morbidity and mortality. Although traditional laparotomy remains common, laparoscopic approaches are emerging as effective alternatives, offering potential advantages in diagnosis and management. This case underscores the importance of considering MD with MDB in adults presenting with SBV and highlights key surgical management strategies."

This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to generate realistic simulation scenarios to assist faculty as a significant challenge in medical education. This study employs a qualitative research design and thematic analysis to interpret expert opinions. The study was conducted in two phases. Scenario generation via ChatGPT and expert review for validation. We used ChatGPT (GPT-4) to create clinical scenarios on cardiovascular topics, including cardiogenic shock, postoperative cardiac tamponade after heart surgery, and heart failure. A panel of five experts, four nurses with expertise in emergency medicine and critical care and an anesthesia specialist, evaluated the scenarios. The experts' feedback, strengths and weaknesses, and proposed revisions from the expert discussions were analyzed via thematic analysis. Key themes and proposed revisions were identified, recorded, and compiled by the research team. The clinical scenarios were produced by ChatGPT in less than 5 seconds per case. The thematic analysis identified six recurring themes in the experts' discussions: clinical accuracy, the clarity of learning objectives, the logical flow of patient cases, realism and feasibility, alignment with nursing competencies, and level of difficulty. All the experts agreed that the scenarios were realistic and followed clinical guidelines. However, they also identified several errors and areas that needed improvement. The experts identified and documented specific errors, incorrect recommendations, missing information, and inconsistencies with standard nursing practices. It seems that, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for developing clinical scenarios, but expert review and refinement are necessary to ensure the accuracy and alignment of the generated scenarios with clinical and educational standards."

This report describes the case of an immunocompetent man who developed cardiac tamponade due to a paradoxical response during TB treatment. No pericardial effusion was observed at the time of diagnosis. However, he developed cardiac tamponade 35 days after the initiation of anti-TB drugs. He was treated with emergency pericardial drainage and systemic corticosteroid therapy, after which his hemodynamic status improved. Although there was no recurrence of the increased pericardial effusion, the patient died from a central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection. Cardiac tamponade caused by a paradoxical response is extremely rare in a patient without human immunodeficiency virus infection. Even if there are no findings of tuberculous pericarditis at the time of diagnosis, the possibility of a paradoxical response should be considered in a patient who subsequently develops cardiac tamponade."

In this report, the authors describe an unusual case of a patient presenting with chest pain and presyncopal symptoms after cardiac surgery who ultimately received a diagnosis of LA dissection and associated complete heart block. Although permanent pacemaker placement was required as a result of recurrent episodes of complete heart block, the patient was otherwise managed safely using a conservative approach without surgical reintervention. LA dissection is a surgical complication most commonly identified following mitral valve intervention, and it may be associated with debridement of calcium along the mitral annulus. Urgent surgical repair is indicated when LA dissection results in hemodynamic instability, typically through obstruction of the left atrial outflow, obstruction of the left atrial inflow, or cardiac tamponade. Although complete heart block is not a previously reported downstream complication of LA dissection, aspects of the atrioventricular (AV) node, particularly the compact AV node, lie within the interatrial septum and could be damaged by dissection. LA dissection is a rare, but potentially serious, complication that most commonly arises following mitral valve surgery. Although the presence of hemodynamic instability renders LA dissection a surgical emergency, a conservative approach that avoids reintervention may otherwise be considered."

The dog developed tension pneumothorax shortly after intubation because of erroneous connection of the endotracheal tube to the auxiliary oxygen flowmeter instead of the breathing circuit. A prompt diagnosis, based on reduced compliance during manual ventilation, bradycardia and second-degree atrioventricular block, combined with barrel-shaped thoracic distension, led to an emergency needle thoracocentesis, followed by bilateral thoracostomy tube placement. Computed tomography was then performed as scheduled with an added scan sequence for the thorax. General anaesthesia was maintained using total intravenous techniques with propofol and ketamine infusions. Hospital morbidity and mortality rounds identified various active and system failures as contributing factors. The 22 mm connector attached to the auxiliary oxygen flowmeter tubing was recognized as the major contributing factor, as it could be connected to both the endotracheal tube and oxygen mask. Consequently, the decision was made to no longer use the auxiliary oxygen flowmeter for preoxygenation.

However, emerging evidence suggests that prioritizing airway management in exsanguinating patients may worsen hypotension and increase mortality. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the Circulation-Airway-Breathing (CAB) approach compared to the traditional ABC sequence in improving survival in trauma patients with severe hemorrhage. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Databases including PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE, SCOPUS, web of science and EMBASE were searched for studies published up to September 2024. Eligible studies included observational and comparative studies reporting outcomes of trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for risk of bias assessment. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) for mortality, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analysis was conducted to compare the ABC and CAB approaches in prospective and retrospective studies. Six studies (N = 11,855 patients) met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed a significant increase in mortality associated with the ABC approach (pooled OR: 3.65, 95% CI: 1.74-7.65). Subgroup analysis of prospective cohort studies found an even higher mortality risk (POR: 9.99, 95% CI: 5.59-17.85) when compared with POR of retrospective studies (POR: 2.42, 95%CI: 1.08-5.36). High heterogeneity (I2 = 92%) was observed across the studies, likely due to variations in patient populations and resuscitation protocols. Prioritizing circulation over airway management in trauma patients with exsanguinating injuries significantly reduces mortality compared to the traditional ABC approach. The present consensus paper, conducted according to the WSES methodology3, aims to provide a review of the literature comparing the CAB approach to the traditional ABC sequence in trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage, to develop a shared consensus statement based on the currently available evidence."

The relationship between influenza infections, particularly influenza B, and cardiac complications such as myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade remains underexplored, particularly in immunocompetent individuals. We report the case of a 22-year-old immunocompetent female who presented to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness due to symptoms suggestive of an influenza-like illness. Laboratory and imaging findings revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion suggestive of cardiac tamponade. Subsequent investigations confirmed influenza B infection. The patient was managed with pericardiocentesis, oseltamivir, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and supportive care, resulting in complete recovery. This case highlights the significance of considering influenza as a potential cause of acute cardiac complications and the importance of early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to prevent morbidity and mortality. The occurrence of cardiac tamponade secondary to influenza B infection in a young, immunocompetent female highlights the critical need to educate healthcare providers about the potential cardiovascular complications of influenza. The mechanisms underlying influenza-associated cardiac involvement may include direct viral invasion, systemic inflammation, and immune-mediated responses. This case contributes to the limited but growing body of literature on influenza-induced cardiac complications and highlights the importance of timely antiviral therapy alongside traditional management strategies for cardiac tamponade. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of influenza-related cardiac complications and to provide guidelines for the management of such cases."

Thus, early detection of PCE is extremely important in initial resuscitation. A 37-year-old man without any past medical illness was sent to our emergency department by ambulance due to left chest wall penetrating injury by nail gun 30 minutes ago. Upon presentation, the patient was agitated and diaphoretic. The penetration site was in the region of cardiac box, which raised awareness that possible heart injury has been inflicted. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was used immediately to screen for PCE which was present. In addition, POCUS revealed a hyper-echoic point in the left ventricle (LV) which we speculate is the foreign body (FB). Non-contrast computed tomography confirmed the presence of PCE and FB in the LV. The patient received emergent blood transfusion and was immediately transferred to a level-1 trauma center where removal of FB and cardiorrhaphy of LV apex was performed. He was discharged one week later under stable condition. Take home Message: The presence of hemopericardium in penetrating thoracic trauma may cause life threatening injuries such as cardiac tamponade which warrants immediate intervention. POCUS is a reliable, repeatable, and readily available tool at bedside for detecting PCE in penetrating thoracic trauma patients. Given its high sensitivity and specificity, POCUS should be used as the initial screening tool for the presence of PCE in all thoracic penetrating trauma patients."

CASE REPORT A 58-year-old woman was hit by a car while riding an electric bicycle. She presented with neck pain and dyspnea on admission to the hospital. The CT scan showed suspected fractures of the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae without evidence of cervical emphysema. Serial blood tests revealed a rapidly decreasing hemoglobin level. An urgent surgical exploration of the neck was performed. Intraoperative findings included complete tears of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments of the cervical spine, rupture of the 5th and 6th cervical intervertebral discs, and a longitudinal laceration of the posterior pharyngeal wall. The patient underwent surgical management, which included PP repair and cervical spine infusion via an anterior cervical approach. The buccopharyngeal fascia was sutured to the prevertebral fascia to seal the connection between the PP and the prevertebral space. The patient recovered well after surgery. The 3-month postoperative follow-up showed a stable cervical spine and good healing of the PP. CONCLUSIONS We present the first case of PP associated with severe cervical spine injury following blunt trauma. Direct laryngoscopy is essential to establish the presence of PP and to assess the size and location of the injury. In this rare case, suturing the buccopharyngeal fascia and prevertebral fascia to isolate the PP and spinal implant was effective in preventing implant infection and surgical failure potentially caused by salivary leakage."

Although intestinal obstruction comprises 2 % - 8 % of the cases of acute abdomen presenting to emergency, obstruction due to appendicular band syndrome is a rare entity. A 43-year-old male presented with features suggestive of small bowel obstruction for 5 days. On examination, the abdomen was distended and tense with generalized mild tenderness all over the abdomen. CECT (abdomen and pelvis) showed a transition point in the distal ileum, with dilated bowel loops proximal to it. On exploratory laparotomy, the appendix was found completely encircling the distal ileum, forming a constricting band, for which release of appendicular band with appendectomy was done. The initiating event in appendicular band syndrome is acute appendicitis itself. Due to the inflammation of appendix, its tip gets adhered to the caecum, retro-peritoneum, ileal mesentery, or ileum itself, forming a potential gap. A segment of bowel may herniate through this gap and become entrapped, resulting in closed-loop obstruction and subsequent strangulation. In the absence of bowel strangulation, releasing the appendicular band along with appendectomy is sufficient. However, if the bowel loop is found to be gangrenous, resection with primary anastomosis is warranted. Appendicular band syndrome, often diagnosed intraoperatively, should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses when evaluating patients with features of bowel obstruction. Early diagnosis guides incision planning, while timely surgical intervention is crucial for preventing serious complications."

    "abstract": "A 6-month-old neutered male Belgian Malinois dog living in a kennel was presented to a veterinary emergency service for the management of severe respiratory distress that had developed within the past 24 h. Thoracic radiographs performed by a referring veterinarian showed abnormalities identified as a pneumothorax. Upon admission to the emergency service, the striking anomalies turned out to be a large intrathoracic air-filled cavity and countless smaller ones causing mechanical compression of the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma and mimicking tension pneumothorax. Emergency management included thoracocentesis followed by placement of a thoracostomy tube. The dog exhibited rapid clinical improvement and recovered completely within a few days, without requiring surgical intervention. Serial follow-up radiographs showed progressive and complete resolution of all lesions. Based on the complete resolution without resection, the main lesion-initially interpreted as a giant pulmonary bulla-was ultimately considered consistent with an acquired pneumatocele. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report in veterinary medicine of a vanishing lung syndrome presentation in a dog."

    "abstract": "Abdominal surgery is widely described for several diseases in cattle. While in adults surgical procedures are generally performed in standing or in sternal recumbency, lateral or dorsal recumbency is preferred in calves. General anaesthesia is associated with several side effects, and epidural anaesthesia (EA) is a valid alternative anaesthetic protocol for several surgical approaches. Previous studies have already been published about abdominal surgery in calves for several diseases, but they are not focused on short-term outcomes. Therefore, there is a need to report a case series for calves that have undergone exploratory laparotomy under EA. General anaesthesia is limited in cattle due to its association with several complications, such as ruminal stasis, regurgitation and tympany, and alternative protocols need to be used. The aim of this study is to describe the surgical features and short-term outcomes of elective and emergency laparotomies in calves under EA. In more complex or longer-lasting surgery, with a median duration of 80 min, intravenous administration of xylazine was necessary. Short-term survival (defined as survival until discharge from the hospital) rate was 90.1%. The EA was sufficient to ensure adequate analgesia in most surgeries. This type of anaesthesia is easy to administer, with limited side effects. The results of this study support surgeons in decision-making in the event of pathologies requiring abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "The Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (eFAST) plays a crucial role in the emergency department (ED) by providing rapid and non-invasive diagnostic information in trauma patients. It is a diagnostic-free fluid detection technique that uses sonography to assess trauma in different anatomical windows of the chest and abdomen and has been accepted in multiple studies as the initial diagnostic tool for torso injuries in blunt abdominal trauma. By promptly identifying potentially life-threatening injuries, such as haemoperitoneum, haemothorax, and cardiac tamponade, eFAST facilitates timely intervention and improves patient outcomes in the ED. The eFAST exam is reliable, with high sensitivity and specificity, even when performed by non-radiological personnel, saving time and resources in the chaotic emergency environment. This review aims to assess the diagnostic reliability and limitations of eFAST in different trauma conditions and to outline its goals in trauma critical care and in \"ABCDE\" resuscitation."

    "abstract": "Open cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OCPR) is a critical treatment for severe torso trauma. While OCPR has shown survival benefits for patients with penetrating traumatic cardiac arrest, its efficacy in blunt trauma patients remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study analyzed pulseless blunt chest trauma patients from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) in the United States during 2014-2015. The study excluded patients under 18 years of age, those without initial signs of life, and those with burns, penetrating trauma, unknown mechanisms, incomplete records, severe head injuries, or transportation times over 60 min. The primary outcome was Emergency Department (ED) survival, and the secondary outcome was overall survival. Out of 1358 pulseless blunt chest trauma patients, 420 met the inclusion criteria, and 15.5 % (65/420) received OCPR. ED survival was significantly greater in the OCPR group (81.5 % [53/65] vs. 46.8 % [166/355], p < 0.001), whereas overall survival was not significantly different between the groups (9.2 % [6/65] vs. 12.4 % [44/355], p = 0.626). A subset analysis of patients with cardiac injuries showed better ED survival (81.3 % [13/16] vs. 40.5 % [17/42], p = 0.012) and a trend of better overall survival (25.0 % [4/16] vs. 3.4 % [2/42], p = 0.086) for those who underwent OCPR. OCPR does not improve overall survival in all pulseless blunt chest trauma patients, but it offers significant benefits for those with cardiac injuries. Further research is needed to refine management strategies for these patients."

    "abstract": "Emergency room (ER) urgent care professionals (UCPs) are often the first point of contact for cases inclusive of intimate partner violence, blunt trauma, penetrating trauma and sexual assault. These are potential forensic cases which put UCPs in contact with forensic evidence. UCPs care for both victims and perpetrators of a crime. It is important for UCPs to provide healthcare and be able to take actions when they encounter evidence that can be useful in a forensic investigation. In Barbados between 2019 and 2020 there were 36,833 emergency room visits, an average of 20 cases/year (0.05 %) were identified as forensic (1). The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge, behaviours, and attitudes of UCPs in ERs in Barbados regarding forensic science and evidence in order to put meaningful interventions in place. UCPs were recruited from a convenience sample from public and private ERs using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. 105 UCPs met the inclusion criteria, they practiced in six ERs. The highest percentage of participants were doctors and nurses. UCPs who met the inclusion criteria were surveyed using a four-part questionnaire on demographics, knowledge, behaviours and attitudes. The average knowledge score of participants was 68 %. The highest mean knowledge scores were among doctors and nurses. The lowest knowledge score was on \"what is forensic evidence\". On behaviours, 13 % accurately evaluated patients as potential forensic cases, 76.5 % of participants answered \"never\" to use of tamper evident bags and 90.6 % said their ER did not have evidence kits/trolleys, 13.3 % had received courtroom testimony training. Concerning attitudes 39 % of the respondents believed that victims and perpetrators deserve equal care, 68 % believed that victims have a right to refuse care and 67 % believed that forensic evidence was important in their practice. Participants showed adequate knowledge about what forensic evidence means and how it can be applied to practice. Absence of evidence kits in the ER impacts visibility to UCPs. There is need for training in their use and what their presence implies."

    "abstract": "Background/Objective: Part of the workload of ambulance service involves patients with low-acuity health events that do not require the specific resources provided by ambulance services or emergency departments (EDs). The problem of inappropriateness is also present in Italy. However, research is limited to the perspective of triage nurses only, excluding patients and emergency medical service (EMS) staff. This study aims to identify the presence of inappropriate ambulance use in the study context by comparing patients' perception of emergency with appropriateness perspectives of both triage nurses and emergency service staff. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 109 patients transported by ambulance was performed between January and March 2020. Questionnaires were distributed to patients, EMS staff, and triage nurses operating in the chief town and hinterland of a region of Italy. Results: Non-penetrating trauma was the most frequent cause for calling an ambulance. Patients referred that activation of the service was necessary, while triage nurses and EMS technicians were in line in believing the non-urgency of the call due to non-emergent health conditions. Conclusions: Although we cannot conclude that citizens use the emergency system inappropriately, the results of this study make us think about the need to implement educational interventions that increase citizens' knowledge of how the service works and the territorial services available."

These conditions pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, particularly in critically ill or sedated children. We report the case of a five-year-old girl who was initially hospitalized for posterior fossa tumor resection and developed acute abdominal distension, anemia, and hematemesis in the postoperative period. Imaging was limited because of the hemodynamic instability. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a large duodenal perforation and a concomitant gallbladder perforation. The surgical management included primary duodenal repair, cholecystectomy, and gastroduodenal bypass. Despite intensive supportive care, the patient succumbed to sepsis and multiorgan failure on postoperative day 2. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulty of gastrointestinal perforations in sedated intensive care unit patients, the possible pathophysiological link between duodenal ulcers and adjacent gallbladder inflammation, and the urgency for surgical intervention. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion of stress-related gastrointestinal complications in critically ill children. Early surgical exploration may be life-saving when imaging is inconclusive and clinical deterioration is rapid."

    "abstract": "Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) tend to be higher in emergent trauma cases. To combat this increased risk, the skin is often left open and allowed to heal by secondary intention. We sought to investigate the effect of the implementation of incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) in trauma laparotomies. Methods: A single-institution retrospective chart review was performed of trauma patients receiving an emergent exploratory laparotomy between 2015 and 2022. Patients with class II and III wounds were included. The primary outcome was open wound at discharge between the pre-iNPWT and post-iNPWT implementation. The secondary outcome was development of superficial SSI in closed wounds. Results: 260 patients, 111 pre-iNPWT and 149 post-iNPWT implementation, were included. The proportion of patients who were discharged with an open wound in the pre-iNPWT group was 52.3% vs 18.8% in the post-iNPWT group, P = <.001. The proportion of patients with closed wounds who developed a superficial SSI in the pre-iNPWT group was 12.1%, 8 of 66, vs 5.9%, 8 of 135, in the post-iNPWT group, P = .13. The proportion of patients with closed class III wounds who developed a superficial SSI was 14.0%, 7 of 50, vs 5.0%, 6 of 119, in the post-iNPWT group, P = .046. Conclusion: Our study identified a decrease in the number of patients who were discharged with an open wound after the implementation of iNPWT without an increase in SSIs. A decrease in SSIs in class III wounds closed with iNPWT was also observed."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is the most common small intestine anomaly. Although it is often asymptomatic, in pediatric patients it typically presents as obstruction or lower gastrointestinal bleeding due to ileo-ileal intussusception. We present the case of a pediatric patient in his second decade of life with symptoms of an acute abdomen and laboratory abnormalities suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process. A computed tomography scan revealed small bowel dilation, increased bowel wall diameter, and air-fluid levels. He underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed an intussusception of a MD. The affected segment was resected, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis. In cases where complications of MD are strongly suspected, the surgeon should opt for surgical management as soon as possible, whether by laparotomy, laparoscopy, or laparoscopically assisted surgery. Regardless of the available options, an appropriate decision should be made based on intraoperative findings and potential postoperative complications. Surgical treatment should depend on intraoperative findings and the surgeon's expertise to ensure a safe and complication-free procedure."

Therefore, rapid diagnosis and treatment of cardiac tamponade is critical. A 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with chest pain and undifferentiated shock. A computer tomography (CT) aortogram showed a pericardial effusion, active contrast extravasation (possibly arising from the right coronary artery), but no aortic dissection. Echocardiography confirmed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The consensus between cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery was for urgent coronary angiography to identify the source of bleeding. This showed a network of vessels from the right coronary artery that appeared to supply a mass. Re-review of the CT scan and repeat targeted echocardiography showed the silhouette of a mass adjacent to the right atrium. The patient was taken immediately for cardiac surgery. A cardiac tumour extending through the right atrial wall was identified, resected, and subsequently was diagnosed histologically as a cardiac angiosarcoma. Malignancy is responsible for only a small proportion of pericardial effusions and metastatic disease is overwhelmingly more common than primary cardiac neoplasms. This case highlights the use of multi-modality cardiac imaging to guide diagnosis and treatment, and the need to consider the rarer causes of haemopericardium in cases where the more common causes have been excluded."

In particular, metallic stent placement should be performed in emergent situations for malignant superior vena cava syndrome presenting with cerebral or laryngeal edema. In malignant cases, the obstruction is usually traversed via the femoral vein. When it fails, an additional trial via the brachial or internal jugular vein is performed, and if necessary, through-and-through access is established. In benign chronic obstructions that cannot be crossed by conventional techniques, sharp recanalization techniques are salvage options. The procedures are relatively safe; however, major complications such as acute pulmonary edema, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, and stent migration should be warned."

The European Trauma Course (ETC) and the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines differ on needle size and decompression site, creating clinical uncertainty. This meta-analysis aims to explore the optimal approach for emergency needle decompression in TP. This meta-analysis followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. It included English-language RCTs, cohort, case-control, cross-sectional studies, and case series with more than six patients. Studies on adults undergoing needle decompression therapy for TP or with chest wall thickness measurements were included. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched until May 31, 2024. Data were extracted, assessed for quality using OCEBM and GRADE, and analyzed using SPSS and OpenMeta with random-effects models. needle decompression failure rate. patient demographics, cannula size, and chest wall thickness comparisons. This review analyzed 51 studies on needle decompression for TP, with a weighted mean patient age of 36.67 years. Radiological data from 24 studies (n = 8046) indicated a 32.84% failure rate for needle penetration into the pleural cavity (I2: 99.72%). Increased needle length reduced failure rates by 7.76% per cm. No significant differences in chest wall thickness between genders were observed (T-test, p = 0.77), but thickness at the 5th anterior axillary line (5AAL) and 5th midaxillary line (5MAL) was less than at the 2nd midclavicular line (2MCL). Injury rates were higher at 5AAL than 5MAL, with strong positive correlations between needle length and injury at these sites (0.88, 0.91). Based on our meta-analysis, a 7 cm needle may be appropriate for decompression of right-sided tension pneumothorax at either the 5th intercostal space along the midaxillary line or the 2nd intercostal space along the midclavicular line. For left-sided cases, given the potential risk of cardiac injury, the 2nd midclavicular line is a safer option. However, these recommendations should be interpreted with caution due to considerable heterogeneity among the included studies, potential risk of bias, and variability in measurement techniques. Clinical decisions should always be individualized, taking into account patient-specific factors."

    "abstract": "Open book fractures frequently occur in road traffic accidents and are often associated with organ injuries, soft tissue damage, and urogenital trauma. Pelvic fractures can vary in severity, with some being stable and others involving significant structural disruption. A 32-year-old man presented with severe lower abdominal and right lower limb pain following a road traffic accident. He remained alert and denied loss of consciousness but exhibited tachycardia. Examination revealed lower abdominal tenderness, pelvic swelling, bruising, and a scrotal hematoma. CT imaging showed extensive pelvic fractures involving the sacral promontory and right sacral ala, along with bladder rupture and urethral injury. He underwent urgent pelvic external fixation and exploratory laparotomy with bladder repair. Postoperatively, he developed hypovolemic shock, requiring ICU admission, fluid resuscitation, and blood transfusion. Intensive monitoring and conservative management stabilized his condition, allowing for additional surgical procedures. Despite the severity of his injuries, he showed signs of recovery, with stabilized vital signs and reduced pelvic swelling. Continued medical and supportive care underscored the importance of timely and comprehensive management in severe pelvic trauma cases. Bladder trauma is a serious complication of pelvic injuries, ranging from minor contusions to complete rupture. These injuries require prompt recognition and surgical intervention. Damage often occurs due to force transmission to the bladder, especially when it is full, leading to increased pressure and potential rupture. Given its location near the pelvic bones, the bladder is at a higher risk of injury in severe trauma. Symptoms may include lower abdominal pain, swelling, bruising, and signs of circulatory distress. Imaging helps assess the extent of injury and guides surgical management. Timely intervention is essential to prevent complications such as infection and long-term dysfunction. A multidisciplinary approach, vigilant monitoring, and aggressive management of complications are key to optimizing recovery in complex pelvic trauma cases."

    "abstract": "Intracranial foreign bodies resulting from criminal assaults that cause penetrating trauma are relatively rare. Such cases are often accompanied by significant complications, including intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, major vascular injury, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage, which pose substantial challenges in clinical management. Herein, we report a successful case of surgical treatment for an intracranial metallic foreign body, aiming to provide valuable insights for similar clinical scenarios. A 38-year-old male patient was urgently admitted to our emergency department following an intentional assault with a sickle, which resulted in an intracranial penetrating injury. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed the presence of a metallic foreign body that traversed the left temporal lobe and extended to the sphenoid bone and the posterior region of the right orbit. In response to this critical situation, an emergency surgical procedure was promptly initiated. The treatment strategy involved a combination of craniotomy and transnasal approaches to remove the metallic foreign body and reconstruct the skull base. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited no obvious adverse reactions, and his condition remained stable throughout the follow-up period. Intracranial foreign bodies often penetrate neural structures via the orbit or nasal cavity. When dealing with a long foreign body predominantly situated within the brain parenchyma, it is crucial to avoid blindly extracting it. Instead, shortening the length of the foreign body may be a more feasible approach to facilitate its safe removal and transportation. Preoperative acquisition of comprehensive imaging data is of utmost importance, as it aids in delineating the spatial relationship between the foreign body, major intracranial vessels, and cranial nerves, thereby enabling the formulation of a rational surgical plan. Whenever possible, the removal of intracranial foreign bodies should be carried out within 6-8 h post-trauma. Additionally, reliable skull base reconstruction is essential to prevent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and mitigate the risk of infectious complications."

    "abstract": "Splenic abscess is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can rupture, leading to pneumoperitoneum and symptoms that mimic gastrointestinal perforation in rare cases. This can significantly complicate accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. A splenic abscess can become life-threatening by rupturing, which may cause diffuse peritonitis or sepsis. A 68-year-old man with uncontrolled diabetes presented with fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Initial evaluation at a previous hospital, including computed tomography (CT), suggested a lower gastrointestinal perforation, leading to his transfer to our facility. CT revealed a non-enhancing lesion with gas in the spleen and free intraperitoneal air; however, there was no clear evidence of gastrointestinal perforation. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, which revealed purulent ascites and a ruptured splenic abscess without any gastrointestinal perforation. After thorough lavage to eliminate contamination, open abdominal management was initiated owing to a need for catecholamine support and an inability to completely rule out the possibility of gastrointestinal perforation. A second-look laparotomy confirmed that there was no further contamination or gastrointestinal tract perforation. Blood and abscess cultures revealed Escherichia coli, leading us to initiate targeted antibiotic therapy. The patient recovered successfully and was discharged on postoperative day 40 without any recurrence. Ruptured splenic abscess with pneumoperitoneum is rare and poses significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in patients with diabetes, owing to its clinical similarity to gastrointestinal perforation. This study highlights the utility of exploratory laparotomy and staged open abdominal management when gastrointestinal perforation cannot be ruled out. Physicians should consider ruptured splenic abscesses in patients with pneumoperitoneum, particularly those with diabetes. Exploratory laparotomy with staged open abdominal management may represent an effective approach that facilitates safe monitoring and targeted treatment, thereby reducing the risk of fatal complications."

Limited data exist on the impact of mode of transport in regionalized trauma systems. This study examines the association between trauma designation levels and survival to hospital discharge of patients with blunt trauma transported by police or ground ambulance. This retrospective-matched cohort study used the 2017 National Trauma Data Bank dataset. Adult blunt trauma patients transported by police were identified and matched (one-to-four) to those transported by ground ambulance. Demographic characteristics, injury, and clinical data were described and compared according to trauma designation levels. The survival rate was determined by the transport mode and/or the trauma designation levels. A total of 5316 blunt trauma patients were included. Mean age was 41.8 (±16.5) years, and most were males (81.8%). Most patients were transported to Level I centers and were more likely to be admitted (91.1%) compared to those transported to level II and level III trauma centers (87.5%). They also had a lower survival rate compared with the latter group ((98.7%) vs. (99.7%), p = 0.001). Survival rates were similar when comparing patients by mode of transport (p = 0.785). This remained unchanged after stratifying by the trauma designation levels (p > 0.05). Adult patients with blunt trauma transported by police or ground ambulance had similar survival across different trauma level centers. Increased police involvement in the transport of blunt trauma patients is recommended."

    "abstract": "Perforated duodenal ulcers post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are rare, with fewer than 30 documented cases. Diagnosis can be challenging due to the absence of pneumoperitoneum on cross-sectional imaging, seen in only five published cases.  A 67-year-old female patient, 24 years post RYGB, presented with diffuse abdominal pain, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia following recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use. Laboratory findings showed leukopenia and elevated lipase. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum, prompting emergent exploratory laparotomy. A 0.5 cm duodenal perforation was identified and repaired with omental plication. Postoperatively, the patient developed bacteremia and intra-abdominal abscess requiring prolonged antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. Empiric Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment and lifelong proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were initiated. No standard treatment exists for post-RYGB duodenal perforation, though omental patch plication is commonly performed. Some advocate for complete gastrectomy to prevent ulcer formation; however, risks of doing so include dysmotility, bacterial overgrowth, and recurrent ulceration. Theories regarding the etiology of these ulcers include persistent acid production in the remnant stomach, H. pylori infection, and potential NSAID-related effects. Lifelong PPI use, clinical monitoring for recurrent ulcers, and early endoscopy in symptomatic patients constitute long-term patient management. While routine surveillance endoscopy is not standard, it may be considered in high-risk patients such as those with poor nutrition, ulceration while on PPI, or current smokers."

We present a 58-year-old man who visited the emergency department with a headache for two weeks. A CT scan of the brain revealed a right posterior parietal mass with surrounding vasogenic edema and sulcal effacement as well as a large mass arising from the sella. The patient underwent mass resection, and the pathology results indicated a metastatic adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung. The patient later returned to the emergency department with dyspnea and a cough, and a thorough work-up indicated the patient was suffering from cardiac tamponade secondary to metastasis. The patient underwent a pericardiectomy, pericardial window, and thoracentesis with thoracostomy tube placement. One liter of pericardial fluid was removed, and he was discharged with follow-up for outpatient treatment. Overall, this patient has a poor prognosis due to the presentation of metastases to the brain and pericardium.

    "title": "Band Adhesion Causing Intestinal Obstruction Without Previous Surgery in Pregnancy: A Rare Case.",
    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction (IO) during pregnancy is a rare occurrence. Although uncommon, IO in pregnancy carries a significant risk of maternal and fetal mortality. Diagnosing IO can be challenging, as abdominal pain and vomiting in pregnant patients may be mistaken for labor pain or hyperemesis gravidarum. Early reports strongly recommend exploratory surgery as the standard treatment once IO is diagnosed. The delivery of the baby during the same procedure may be necessary if the surgical emergency jeopardizes the pregnancy. However, this approach is not ideal if the pregnancy is not at term. In recent years, some cases have demonstrated that small bowel intestinal obstruction (SBIO) can be managed conservatively. In our case, we successfully managed the patient conservatively before performing an exploratory laparotomy and lower segment cesarean section in the same setting to prevent maternal and fetal complications. IO without prior surgery is rare, and even more so during pregnancy. Our case highlights a rare instance of pregnancy-related IO caused by band adhesions in the absence of previous surgical history."

A 16-year-old female patient fell from the third floor of a secondary school building and was admitted to the Emergency Department with traumatic shock, and multiple organ injuries including head injury, spinal fracture, femur fracture, and blunt abdominal trauma. The patient received initial first aid and diagnostic tests, including blood tests, abdominal ultrasound, and contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography, which revealed a gallbladder injury and free abdominal air. Diagnostic laparoscopy identified a gallbladder hematoma, with no hollow organ rupture. Open surgery was performed to examine the duodenum and digestive tract, revealing no additional organ injuries. The gallbladder was removed, and the patient recovered without complications by day 6 postoperatively, before being transferred for orthopedic surgery."

    "abstract": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the infrarenal Aorta. The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by the persistent presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with recurrent venous or arterial thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity. A 38-year-old woman, with a known case of APS, was referred to the emergency department three days after undergoing her second cesarean section. She presented with a 3-day history of fatigue and weakness with tachycardia and decreased blood pressure. Because of unstable hemodynamics, portable ultrasonography was performed and revealed intra-abdominal massive hematoma and free fluid with debris in the abdominal and pelvic spaces, the surgical team performed an exploratory laparotomy to assess the extent of the internal bleeding and to address the identified hematomas. A midline incision was performed for exploratory laparotomy, revealing a massive extraperitoneal hematoma in Zone 1 which ruptured immediately, not allowing the origin of the hematoma to be identified. Then cardiovascular collapse happened. Despite resuscitative efforts, including prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 30 minutes, the patient did not respond and was pronounced dead. In this case, early detection of an AAA and prompt investigation might have enabled safer management of the pregnancy and cesarean section complications.

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies (8.6 % in men and 6.4 % in women), with varying presentations, including complications such as appendicular abscess. While the typical clinical course involves right lower quadrant pain and fever, rare complications can present with atypical symptoms, particularly in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes. A 55-year-old diabetic female presented with a 10-day history of worsening abdominal pain, foul-smelling discharge at the anterior abdominal wall below the umbilicus, and fever. Imaging revealed an appendicular abscess extending into the anterior abdominal wall. Emergency exploratory laparotomy showed a perforated appendix with a purulent collection in the peritoneal cavity extending to the anterior abdominal wall, requiring drainage and right hemicolectomy. Perforated appendicitis (incidence of 20-30 %), particularly in diabetic patients, can lead to localized abscesses or soft tissue infections in atypical locations such as the abdominal wall. These rare complications are more likely in immunocompromised individuals, including those with diabetes, where the incidence of perforated appendicitis is notably higher. Early imaging with ultrasonography or Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography is critical for identifying complicated appendicitis and guiding surgical intervention. Anterior abdominal wall abscesses as a complication of perforated appendicitis are rare but significant. This case underscores the importance of early and accurate diagnosis, supported by imaging, to guide appropriate surgical management. Timely intervention can help prevent life-threatening conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the risk of postoperative complications, particularly in high-risk populations."

    "abstract": "Emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians encounter patients with suspected femoral shaft fractures due to both blunt and penetrating trauma. Traction splinting is commonly used by many EMS systems on the premise that it might reduce the perceived risk for hemorrhage and can help reduce pain. It has been called into question whether femoral shaft fractures are truly causative of hemorrhagic shock. Additionally, traction splinting has been associated with iatrogenic injuries, especially if applied to patients with co-morbid lower extremity and pelvic injuries. The application of a traction splint is also an infrequent EMS intervention, raising concerns about skill decay and maintenance of competency. Non-traction splinting, or static splinting, is also a therapeutic option in the field management of suspected femur fractures. Because the benefits of traction splinting versus static splinting of suspected femur fractures in the EMS setting are uncertain, the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP) performed a review of the evidence regarding EMS management of femoral shaft fractures and developed the following recommendations and summarization of the evidence. Hemorrhagic shock from femoral shaft fractures is uncommon. EMS clinicians should carefully evaluate for other sources of shock in the hemodynamically unstable trauma patient with suspected midshaft femur fracture(s).EMS clinicians must recognize the challenges in accurately identifying femoral shaft fractures and associated comorbid injuries involving the pelvis and distal extremities.EMS clinicians may use either static or traction splinting to immobilize suspected femoral shaft fractures. Traction splinting carries contraindications, additional risks, and technical complexities that are not present with static splinting.Static splinting may be the preferred method of immobilizing midshaft femur fractures in the prehospital setting.EMS clinicians should not use traction splints unless they have reliably assessed for and reasonably excluded the presence of distal femur fractures, knee joint disruption, and co-morbid ipsilateral lower extremity or pelvic fractures.EMS clinicians should manage pain associated with suspected femur fractures.EMS clinicians should immobilize suspected femoral shaft fractures using either static or traction splinting devices or other means to help reduce movement and control pain in adult and pediatric patients.Analgesic medications should be administered to patients with femoral shaft fractures in the prehospital setting whenever they are within the scope of practice and available to EMS clinicians.Regional anesthesia interventions may have a role in the prehospital treatment of femoral shaft fractures when used by appropriately trained EMS clinicians, but widespread adoption of these interventions in the prehospital setting is not yet supported by existing evidence.EMS clinicians should transport patients with suspected midshaft femur fractures who also meet other triage criteria of the National Trauma Triage Guidelines to a major trauma center. Transport via air-based EMS may be appropriate in select circumstances.EMS physicians play an important role in developing curricula and leading quality management programs to both ensure that EMS clinicians are properly trained in the recognition and management of femoral shaft fractures and that interventions for femoral shaft fractures are performed appropriately, safely, and effectively."

    "abstract": "The study aimed to assess the posterior pericardial windows technique in the management of pericardial effusion following cardiac surgery. This single-center study examined the data of 1,752 patients who underwent cardiac surgery from 2018 onwards, excluding those who had off-pump coronary artery bypass grafts or emergency surgeries for conditions such as type 1 aortic dissection or infective endocarditis. Of the included patients, a posterior pericardial window was created in 349. The posterior pericardial window was created using electrocautery before the implantation of prosthetic valves or distal anastomosis. No other procedural changes were made. Postoperative drainage rates were monitored. Drains were removed on the second day after surgery. Of the patients with a posterior pericardial window, eight (2.3%) required revision due to tamponade within the first two postoperative days, compared to 53 (3.7%) of the patients without a posterior pericardial window. Patients who required revision were discharged on average seven days later, while those who did not require revision were discharged after five days. The early detection and effective management of cardiac tamponade are crucial due to the potentially life-threatening outcomes. This study highlights the value of the posterior pericardial window technique in reducing complications associated with pericardial effusion following cardiac surgery. The findings support the need for further research to improve surgical approaches and enhance patient outcomes and safety."

    "abstract": "Pericardial cysts are rare, with an estimated incidence of approximately 1 in 100,000, and are typically benign and incidentally discovered. However, pericardial cysts leading to cardiac tamponade are exceptionally rare. Herein, we presented the case of a five-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department with symptoms of acute shortness of breath. Initial echocardiography revealed signs of cardiac tamponade, along with the presence of a cystic lesion within the pericardial cavity. Subsequent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of the cyst, leading to an emergency surgical intervention. A median sternotomy was performed, revealing a significant accumulation of hemorrhagic liquid, which was aspirated and sent to the pathological examination. A large cyst was identified situated between the aorta, superior vena cava, and right pulmonary artery. The cyst was excised and sent for pathological examination. The procedure was completed without complications. Histopathological analysis of the cyst revealed no evidence of malignancy. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the sixth postoperative day in good condition. The patient continued to do well at the 10-month follow-up. This case underscores the importance of considering pericardial cysts in the differential diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, despite their rarity. Early imaging and surgical intervention are critical to preventing fatal outcomes in such cases."

While cardiac complications are infrequent, they are more commonly observed in cases of chronic GVHD and may manifest as pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and various arrhythmias. Additionally, chronic GVHD can result in constrictive pericarditis (CP) due to the accumulation of fluid and scarring. A 25-year-old Iranian man developed CP 14 years after undergoing allogenic stem cell transplantation. Following inadequate response to medical therapy, he underwent a pericardiectomy. Pathological examination during follow-up revealed fibrosis and mild chronic inflammation. This report aims to add another case of cardiac manifestation associated with GVHD to the current literature. The main message emphasizes the urgent need for prompt diagnosis and effective pericardiectomy, which can be life-saving.

    "abstract": "Paediatric cervical spine injury (CSI) is uncommon but can have devastating consequences. Many children, however, present to emergency departments (EDs) for the assessment of possible CSI. While imaging can be used to determine the presence of injuries, these tests are not without risks and costs, including exposure to radiation and associated life-time cancer risks. Clinical decision rules (CDRs) to guide imaging decisions exist, although two of the existing rules, the National Emergency X-Radiography Low Risk Criteria and the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR), focus on adults and a newly developed paediatric rule from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) is yet to be externally validated. This study aims to externally validate these three CDRs in children. This is a multicentre prospective observational study of children younger than 16 years presenting with possible CSI following blunt trauma to 1 of 14 EDs across Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. Data will be collected on presenting features (history, injury mechanism, physical examination findings) and management (diagnostic imaging, admission, interventions, outcomes). The performance accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values) of three existing CDRs in identifying children with study-defined CSIs and the specific CDR defined outcomes will be determined, along with multiple secondary outcomes including CSI epidemiology, investigations and management of possible CSI. Ethics approval for the study was received from the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia (HREC/69436/RCHM-2020) with additional approvals from the New Zealand Human and Disability Ethics Committee and the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board.

    "title": "Post-Esophagectomy Chylothorax with Thoracic Duct Anomaly Successfully Treated with Lymphangiography: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Chylothorax following esophagectomy is a relatively rare but significant complication, with incidences ranging from 1.1% to 3.8%. It typically arises from damage to the thoracic duct or associated lymphatic vessels during extensive lymph node dissection and thoracic surgery. Initial management usually relies on conservative approaches such as dietary modifications, drainage, and pharmacotherapy. If these methods are ineffective, surgical intervention becomes necessary. However, standardized guidelines for the optimal management of thoracic duct injuries are as yet lacking, with decisions made on a case-by-case basis. We describe a case of chylothorax following esophagectomy where lymphangiography played a crucial role in guiding the surgical approach. We report the clinical course of a 72-year-old male who developed chylothorax following esophagectomy for recurrent esophageal cancer. Despite initial conservative management, including octreotide and total parenteral nutrition, the patient's condition required further intervention. Lymphangiography performed on postoperative day (POD)14 revealed a rare anatomical variation of the thoracic duct, leading to successful surgical ligation through a right cervical approach. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by mediastinal fluid accumulation and resultant cardiac tamponade, necessitating emergency mediastinal drainage. Following the targeted surgical intervention, the drainage volume decreased, and the patient gradually resumed oral intake after swallowing function training. He was discharged on POD118. Thoracic duct injury after esophagectomy is challenging, especially with anatomical variations. Lymphangiography enables precise localization, guides surgery, and improves outcomes in chylothorax patients. The literature confirms that its early use reduces hospital stays and complications. Tumor invasion or inflammation at or beyond T3 may increase surgical complexity and injury risk. Given its diagnostic and therapeutic benefits, lymphangiography should be integrated into the standard protocols for chylothorax, especially in cases in where conservative treatment fails or anatomical variations are suspected."

    "abstract": "Traumatic neck injuries represent a critical emergency in surgical practice due to the high concentration of vital structures within the cervical region. These injuries can be classified into blunt and penetrating types, each presenting unique challenges in diagnosis and management. While advances in trauma care have improved patient outcomes, the mortality and morbidity associated with neck injuries remain significant, especially in resource-limited settings. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Government Medical College, Thrissur, analyzing the patterns, management, and outcomes of traumatic neck injuries from January 2022 to December 2024. The study included patients aged 13-79 years, with data collected from medical records, trauma registers, and operative reports. Patient demographics, injury type, anatomical location, management strategies, and clinical outcomes were assessed. A total of 72 traumatic neck injuries were reviewed, with the majority being young males (n=57, 79%). Blunt trauma (n=45, 62%) was more common than penetrating trauma (n=27, 38%), with road traffic accidents (n=32, 44%) and falls (n=20, 28%) being the leading causes of blunt injuries, while stabbing injuries accounted for most penetrating trauma (n=20, 73%). Emergency neck exploration was required in 17 cases (24%), and the overall mortality rate was seven cases (10%), primarily due to exsanguination (n=5, 67%) and vascular damage (n=2, 33%). The highest mortality was observed in penetrating Zone II injuries (n=5 deaths, 13%), often involving major vascular damage. Complications occurred in 13 survivors (18%), including wound infections (n=6, 8%), pneumonia (n=4, 5%), and neurological deficits (n=4, 5%). Night-time injuries were reported in 43 cases (60%), with a peak incidence during festive seasons and weekends, showing a significant association with alcohol consumption. The findings align with global trends, where penetrating injuries, especially in Zone II, carry a significantly higher risk of mortality. The study underscores the importance of early airway management, rapid surgical intervention, and the role of imaging-based triage for blunt trauma cases. The association of neck trauma with alcohol consumption, especially during nighttime hours, highlights the need for targeted public health measures and enhanced trauma response. This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology, management strategies, and outcomes of traumatic neck injuries in a South Indian tertiary care center. The findings emphasize the critical role of early intervention, particularly in penetrating injuries involving vascular structures, and suggest that public health interventions and improved trauma care systems could optimize outcomes in this high-risk population."

    "abstract": "Background: Lymphomas account for approximately 10% of cancers diagnosed during pregnancy, with Hodgkin's lymphoma being the most common. However, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), also represent a significant proportion. Both mediastinal lymphomas and pregnancy develop a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism and massive pulmonary embolism (PE), requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: Clinical data, blood test and imagings have been collected by the medical records of the patient. Results: We present a 25-year-old woman, at 32 weeks of gestation, who presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and asthenia. Echocardiography revealed a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion and severe right ventricular dysfunction. Given the severity of her condition, she underwent an emergency caesarean section and subsequently a pericardial drainage. A chest computed tomography scan revealed an incidental mediastinal mass along with a massive PE. Despite pericardial drainage, she remained hemodynamically unstable. Since thrombolysis was contraindicated for the recent cesarean section, venoarterial ECMO was initiated. Systemic anticoagulation was guaranteed by heparin, which shifted to argatroban for heparin resistance. The mediastinal mass was also biopsied, and the diagnosis of PMBCL carried out. Cytoreductive chemotherapy was initiated with the COMP-R regimen (i.e., cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate, prednisone, and rituximab), and the patient progressively improved up to ICU and hospital discharge. Conclusions: This case highlights the challenges in managing a complicated patient requiring early multidisciplinary intervention, which was crucial for stabilizing the patient and optimizing fetal and maternal prognosis."

The impact of an active cancer diagnosis on the short-term outcomes of emergent laparotomy is not well described. A retrospective analysis was conducted using an institutional database comprised of patients admitted from 2015 to 2019 who underwent exploratory laparotomy within 6 h of surgical consultation. The postoperative outcomes of patients with and without an active cancer diagnosis were compared using univariate and multivariable analysis with adjustment for clinical and demographic variables. Among 409 patients who met inclusion criteria, 320 (78.2%) were without an active cancer diagnosis and 89 (21.8%) had an active cancer diagnosis. Patients with cancer were older (median [interquartile range], 63 [56, 70] y versus 59 y [49, 69], P = 0.0001) and presented with higher number of acute severity measures (17.9% versus 13.1%, P = 0.017). Patients with cancer had higher odds of 90-d mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 12.0, 95% confidence interval: [4.9, 29.3]) and 90-d systemic complications (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval: [1.26, 4.50]).

While intraperitoneal pseudocysts are rare, they are most frequently associated with inflammatory processes, including ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications, catheter-related infections. Sclerosing peritonitis (SP), a rare but serious complication of long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, is characterized by marked thickening of the peritoneal membranes. Histologically, these membranes consist of dense fibrotic connective tissue infiltrated by mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. The pathogenesis of SP-associated pseudocysts is thought to involve low-grade infection or localized chronic inflammation. A 59-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presented to the emergency department with chronic abdominal pain. Computed tomography imaging revealed a large peritoneal pseudocyst. During exploratory midline laparotomy, the pseudocyst was successfully evacuated, and the peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed."

    "abstract": "Managing electrolyte abnormalities is one of the cornerstones of properly caring for and managing hospitalized patients. Typically, electrolyte derangements are managed by direct repletion, volume status correction, or hemodialysis; however, the persistence of electrolyte abnormalities despite utilizing appropriate initial strategies requires further investigation. A 72-year-old male presented to the emergency department with weakness 2 months post-exploratory laparotomy with ileostomy for small bowel perforation complicated by intra-abdominal infection. The patient was treated for sepsis and imaging revealed intra-abdominal and abdominal wall abscesses. After drainage, recovery was complicated by treatment of refractory hypomagnesemia in the context of zinc supplementation. If initial electrolyte repletion measures do not provide the intended benefit, investigating secondary causes of refractory electrolyte abnormalities is necessary. While hypomagnesemia is one of the least common electrolyte derangements seen within the general acute care hospital setting, in facilities with relatively high volumes of bariatric or gastrointestinal surgical patients, keeping the phenomenon of zinc-induced hypomagnesemia in mind becomes more crucial due to its frequent use in those settings. This case highlights the effects of excess high-dose zinc supplementation in a patient without zinc deficiency in the postoperative period who developed treatment-resistant hypomagnesemia due to zinc-induced impairment of magnesium absorption as well as gastrointestinal and renal losses. Zinc supplementation can cause hypomagnesemia."

    "abstract": "Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces mortality in severe trauma cases. However, the relationships between TXA administration and coagulation/fibrinolysis abnormalities are unclear. We performed a retrospective observational study to investigate relationships between mortality and coagulation/fibrinolysis abnormalities of patients on arrival at the emergency department and whether TXA is more effective in patients with severe trauma who have coagulation/fibrinolysis abnormalities than in those who do not. Data was collected from 15 tertiary emergency and critical care centers in Japan. Adult patients with blunt trauma and an Injury Severity Score of ≥ 16 were included in the study. Patients were categorized into two groups: the TXA group received TXA within 3 h of arrival, and the non-TXA group did not. Overall, 790 patients were included (TXA group, 276; non-TXA group, 514). In cubic spline curves for relationships between mortality and coagulation/fibrinolysis variables on arrival, odds for mortality increased and plateaued with a prothrombin time-international normalized ratio ≥ 1.2; the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score showed a marked odds increase when > 4 points. Odds increased and plateaued from an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of ≥ 35 s and gradually increased as fibrinogen decreased from 250 mg/dL. Fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer exhibited upward-sloping curves. In cubic spline curves for relationships between the effectiveness of TXA administration and coagulation/fibrinolysis variables on arrival, a favorable effect on mortality was observed with TXA administration when fibrinogen was ≤ 200 mg/dL or when the DIC score was ≥ 4 points; FDP, ≥ 50 µg/mL; D-dimer, ≥ 30 µg/mL; or APTT, ≥ 35 s. In each threshold subgroup, interactions between TXA administration and in-hospital mortality were observed. TXA demonstrates increased effectiveness in patients with traumatic coagulation/fibrinolysis abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Traumatic transmesenteric hernia (TTMH) is an exceptionally rare condition with high morbidity and mortality, particularly in children. It can cause life-threatening complications such as ischemic enterocolitis. Internal hernias, including transmesenteric types, are difficult to diagnose preoperatively and are often discovered during emergency laparotomy. A 13-year-old girl presented with acute abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and hypovolemic shock. She had sustained blunt abdominal trauma from a fall two weeks earlier. Initial resuscitation and imaging raised concerns for acute intestinal obstruction. Due to clinical deterioration, an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a transmesenteric hernia with 120 cm of ischemic ileum. Bowel resection and a double-barrel ileostomy were performed. Histopathology confirmed ischemic enterocolitis secondary to the hernia. The patient recovered well and later underwent successful ileostomy reversal. Transmesenteric hernias are rare, typically congenital or post-surgical, with traumatic cases being extremely uncommon. Diagnosis is challenging due to a lack of specific clinical findings. Delayed intervention increases the risk of bowel ischemia and mortality. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulty of TTMH and emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion in trauma patients presenting with acute abdomen. Educating patients with trauma about warning signs & follow up is the recommendation."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a critical condition resulting from various etiologies, including malignancies, inflammatory conditions and iatrogenic causes. With advances in treatments and changing epidemiology, there is a need to reassess the prevalence, management, and outcomes of pericardial tamponade. This study aimed to evaluate the current prevalence of different etiologies of tamponade, the management, and the clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients admitted to a high-volume Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 87 patients diagnosed with cardiac tamponade (median age 70 years; 51% male). Data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics, etiologies, treatment strategies, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Malignant tamponade was the predominant etiology, observed in 47% of cases, with lung cancer being the most common. Other etiologies included inflammatory (22%), iatrogenic (20%), idiopathic (9%), and congestive heart failure-related (2%) effusions. The majority of patients (94%) underwent urgent percutaneous pericardiocentesis. Anti-inflammatory therapy was administered in 67% of cases, including NSAIDs (22%), colchicine (46%), steroids (24%) and IL-1 inhibitors (3%), with some patients receiving combination therapy. The 3-month all-cause mortality rate was 29%, with significantly higher mortality observed in patients with malignant effusions compared to non-malignant causes (49% vs. 11%, p<0.001). This study provides valuable insights into the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with cardiac tamponade at a high-volume cancer center. Neoplastic pericardial effusion, particularly due to lung cancer, is the leading cause of tamponade in this cohort. Anti-inflammatory therapies were frequently used, but their role in improving outcomes requires further investigation. Mortality remains high, especially among those with malignancy-related effusions."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Bronchial rupture following blunt thoracic trauma is an uncommon but potentially fatal injury that requires early recognition and appropriate intervention. Timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary trauma care are essential for improving outcomes and preventing complications. CASE REPORT A 52-year-old man with no prior medical history was admitted to the Emergency Department after a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He presented with multiple injuries, dyspnea, and thoracic and pelvic pain. His initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 15/15. Physical examination revealed subcutaneous emphysema in the cervical region, a distended right hemiabdomen, and absent breath sounds in the right lung. Multiple right-sided chest wall lacerations were noted. An extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) was suggestive of intra-abdominal free fluid, prompting further imaging. A chest CT confirmed the right pneumothorax. An exploratory laparotomy revealed 200 cc of hemoperitoneum, grade 1 liver trauma (segments II and IV), and a non-bleeding hepatic hilum hematoma. Additional procedures included cystostomy, left iliac vein clamping, and pelvic bone stabilization with external fixators. Due to worsening respiratory status on postoperative day 2, the patient underwent an emergency thoracotomy, which revealed a 200-mL clot hemothorax in the costodiaphragmatic recess, middle-lobe contusions, ischemia, and a complete transection of the middle-lobe bronchus extending to the intermediate bronchus. Rib fractures (5th and 6th) necessitated a middle lobectomy and rib fixation. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion for tracheobronchial injuries in blunt thoracic trauma. While eFAST aids in initial assessment, definitive diagnosis requires advanced imaging modalities such as CT and bronchoscopy. Timely surgical interventions and a coordinated multidisciplinary approach are essential for optimal patient outcomes. By sharing this case, we aim to contribute to the understanding and management of rare bronchial injuries."

    "abstract": "Empiric cryoprecipitate administration has recently failed to show survival benefit in hemorrhaging trauma patients. However, a recent Trauma Quality Improvement Program query suggested a survival benefit in massive transfusions when administering 1 U of cryoprecipitate to every 7 to 8 U of red blood cells (RBCs). We describe transfusion ratios when cryoprecipitate was indicated by viscoelastic testing (VET) and evaluated whole blood (WB)'s impact on this ratio. Adult trauma patients admitted from July 2017 to December 2021 who received emergency-release blood products prehospital or in the emergency department were included. Patients who died within 60 minutes were excluded. Massive transfusion patients received arrival VET, which was repeated serially while on massive transfusion protocol. Cryoprecipitate transfusion was based on VET results. Blood product ratios were calculated for RBC, plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate in the first four and 24 hours of resuscitation. Each WB unit was counted as 1 RBC, 1 plasma, and 0.17 U of platelets. Outcomes were evaluated based on blood component ratios. Patients receiving WB were compared with patients who only received blood components. A total of 2,117 patients were included. Overall, the median age was 37 (25, 55) years, 74% were male, 37% were white, and 67% sustained blunt trauma. Overall survival was 77%. The median 4-hour RBC/plasma/platelet/cryoprecipitate ratio was 9:9.5:1.3:1. Patients who received WB did not require cryoprecipitate until later in their resuscitation when compared with blood components (10:9.5:1.7:1 vs. 7:6:1:1, p = 0.008). When using routine VET to guide resuscitation for hemorrhage, cryoprecipitate transfusion occurred later in patients receiving WB incorporated resuscitations compared with the component only strategy. For centers that do not use VET and use algorithmic resuscitation protocols, cryoprecipitate transfusion should be considered after 7 U of RBCs/plasma and after 10 U of a WB incorporated resuscitation.

    "abstract": "Acute abdominal pain is a common clinical problem in emergency and non-emergency cases. Acute abdomen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a challenging diagnostic and therapeutic problem that carries high mortality and morbidity rates. The present study reports a case of a 45-year-old female, a known case of SLE, hypothyroidism, and seizure disorder. The patient presented with chief complaints of pain in the left iliac and lumbar region with a history of amenorrhea for three to four months. Based on the clinical findings, laboratory investigations, and diagnostic assessment involving ultrasonography (USG), the diagnosis of acute abdomen along with tubo-ovarian mass with dermoid cyst and SLE with lupus nephritis and seizure disorder was confirmed. The patient was operated with total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with loop colostomy. The patient was placed in the surgical intensive care unit for observation; however, sepsis developed, and the trauma from the exploratory laparotomy led to septic shock, followed by hypotension and ultimately cardiac arrest. Hence, the cause of death was attributed to sepsis with shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. In conclusion, acute abdomen in SLE suggests that systemic measurement and early laparotomy may improve the prognosis; however, due to chronic inflammatory status and immune-compromised state, the cases should be handled with utmost caution with a multidisciplinary approach due to the increase in the mortality rate."

Pneumopericardium associated with self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) placement is extremely rare. We present a fatal case of pneumopericardium caused by SEMS placement. An 84 year-old man had tumor-induced stenosis of the jejunal limb after total gastrectomy. SEMSs were inserted twice to improve the symptoms without complications. Two days after the implantation of a central venous access port for anorexia, the patient suddenly complained of chest pain and dyspnea, and decreased blood pressure was observed. Chest CT revealed the presence of air in the pericardial cavity. As urgent echography showed cardiac tamponade, pericardiocentesis was performed immediately. The hemodynamic condition temporarily improved after drainage. Although we planned the placement of an additional SEMS to close the fistula, he died 3 days after the onset of symptoms. Pneumopericardium with cardiac tamponade is a potentially fatal situation. An early diagnosis and treatment are important for the management of esophago-pericardial fistula. Prompt drainage is the best management and SEMS placement can achieve effective short-term results."

    "abstract": "Emergency finger thoracostomy (EFT) has been implemented in several European prehospital settings for intubated and ventilated patients with chest injuries. The indication for intervention in cardiac arrest and peri‑arrest situations is clear. EFT may also be applicable in ventilated but macrohemodynamically compensated patients. This study aims to help prehospital providers understand the benefits and applicability of EFT. A retrospective analysis was conducted consisting of 114 EFT cases over 53 months. All chest-injured patients had suspected intrapleural pathology and potential compensated obstructive shock state. Two groups were compared: I. Positive clinical finding after EFT: audible air (pneumothorax (PTX)) and/or blood (hemothorax (HTX)) (n = 85); II. Negative clinical finding: no audible air and/or blood escaping during the procedure (n = 29). The primary endpoint was the effect of EFT on the physiologic parameters. The secondary endpoint was the association between intrathoracic pathology observed during EFT and the physiologic effect. In 75 % of all cases, after EFT, intrapleural pathology was detectable by on-site physical examination. After EFT SpO2 levels increased from 89.6 % (SD 10.7) to 94.9 % (SD 6.7) (p < 0.001). The other physiological parameters did not change significantly (p = 0.346 or higher). In subgroup analysis, there were appreciable increases in SpO2 for those with PTX or PTX with HTX, that were not seen in those with HTX alone or those with negative clinical findings (p < 0.001). No significant adverse effects of EFT were noted during the prehospital phase or in the hospital follow-up period. EFT performed in ventilated patients with suspected compensated obstructive shock (and stable macrohemodynamic) resulted in audible air and/or blood escape and an improvement in oxygenation if PTX or PTX with HTX were the underlying pathology. Performing an EFT should be considered not only for deteriorating obstructive shock state but also for potentially compensated shock. Even with diagnostic uncertainty, the benefits of an EFT may outweigh the risks."

Contrast-enhanced CT of abdomen and pelvis was suspicious for ischaemic colitis and intra-abdominal abscess. In the setting of peritonitis, exploratory laparotomy was performed and found to have a spontaneous rupture of the uterine fundus causing purulent peritonitis. This was managed with the total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The patient had a challenging postoperative course complicated by acute kidney injury, congestive heart failure and failure to thrive. Palliative care was consulted for comfort, and she was discharged to hospice.Ruptured pyometra continues to be associated with high mortality despite early and aggressive management, particularly in patients who present with sepsis and organ failure.

In rare cases, SRUB may present with multiorgan dysfunction including acute liver and kidney failure, complicating management and recovery. It is commonly associated with underlying bladder dysfunction, including chronic urinary retention and bladder outlet obstruction. We report a 58-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who presented with acute abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, and hemodynamic instability. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, renal impairment, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia, as well as elevated bilirubin and liver enzyme levels. Abdominopelvic CT with cystography confirmed SRUB, showing contrast extravasation. The patient underwent an urgent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed two bladder tears that were successfully repaired. Postoperative care included broad-spectrum antibiotics, hemodialysis, and intensive monitoring, leading to a full recovery. SRUB is often misdiagnosed due to its resemblance to gastrointestinal and renal pathologies. This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion in patients with risk factors such as bladder outlet obstruction. CT cystography is crucial for early diagnosis, while surgical repair remains the gold standard for treatment. Supportive care, including hemodialysis and infection control, is vital for optimizing outcomes. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are critical in managing SRUB. Clinicians should consider this rare condition in patients with acute abdomen and known bladder dysfunction to reduce morbidity and improve prognosis."

Of the reported cases, most occur in children and have high degrees of mortality. There are no cases that describe GAS purulent pericarditis as a complication of infective endocarditis. A 43-year-old female presented with an altered conscious state and refractory hypotension. An urgent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a vegetation on the aortic valve, moderate-severe aortic regurgitation and a moderate-large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of early cardiac tamponade. An urgent pericardiocentesis was performed and drained 500 mL of purulent pericardial fluid. Peripheral blood and pericardial fluid cultures grew GAS. Unfortunately the pericardiocentesis did not improve the patient's haemodynamics, she developed recurrent malignant arrhythmias culminating in cardiac arrest and was unable to be resuscitated. To our knowledge this is the first described case of GAS purulent pericarditis arising from infective endocarditis. This case contributes to the limited evidence regarding GAS-related purulent pericarditis. Management includes multidisciplinary care with timely administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prompt drainage, and contemplation of early surgical intervention. Our review of the 20 reported cases of GAS purulent pericarditis reveals that only 6 out of 20 patients were over 18 years old and the mortality ranged from 40% to 85%.

Emergency laparotomies carry a higher risk due to patient and procedural factors. This study aimed to determine the incidence, microbial patterns, and risk factors for SSIs in patients undergoing emergency laparotomies. Methodology A prospective, observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in India from January 2018 to August 2019. Patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgeries were included. Data on patient demographics, perioperative practices, and outcomes were collected. Microbial culture and antibiotic sensitivity were analyzed for SSI cases. Statistical analysis identified significant risk factors. Results Of the 249 patients studied, the incidence of SSI was 17.12%, with 66% superficial, 29.5% deep, and 4.5% organ/space infections. Common pathogens included Escherichia coli (34%) and Klebsiella (15.9%). Risk factors significantly associated with SSIs included tobacco consumption (p = 0.0065), anemia (p = 0.0327), hypoproteinemia (p = 0.0016), obesity (p = 0.0030), and the use of drains (p = 0.0077).

The associated fetal cyclopia adds to the rarity of the case and contributes to the existing literature on uterine rupture. This report demonstrates the need for high clinical suspicion and prompt intervention, even in the absence of usual risk factors. A 30-year-old, gravida 7, para 6 female presented with a two-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and subjective fever. The patient progressed to hemodynamic instability, vaginal bleeding, and loss of consciousness within a few hours of admission. The main diagnosis was spontaneous uterine rupture with hemoperitoneum and a non-viable fetus with cyclopia. The therapeutic interventions included emergency exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of the hemoperitoneum, and subtotal hysterectomy. The patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day five. This case underscores the unpredictable nature of uterine rupture and the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis, even in the absence of typical risk factors, particularly in resource-limited settings.

    "abstract": "Pericardiocentesis, a procedure with potential life-saving implications, can lead to complications such as cardiac perforation. Emergency open cardiac surgery, the conventional approach for addressing iatrogenic or traumatic cardiac perforations, is associated with unfavourable outcomes in high-risk patients. This report explores a case of accidental iatrogenic right ventricular (RV) puncture, which was effectively managed using a percutaneous closure device. A 42-year-old male was hospitalized due to a persistent cough, dyspnoea, and fever, raising suspicion of tuberculosis. He was found to have a large pericardial effusion with signs of impending cardiac tamponade. During an attempted pericardiocentesis at an outside facility, his right ventricle was inadvertently perforated by a catheter. He was transferred to a specialized hospital to be assessed by a cardiac surgeon, where the heart team performed a percutaneous closure of the perforation using an Angio-Seal device, which was successful. A subsequent pericardiectomy was performed to address the effusion and confirm the absence of tuberculosis or malignancy. The patient recovered well, and follow-up imaging showed no worsening of the pericardial effusion. He was discharged in stable condition. Pericardiocentesis, while crucial for treating large pericardial effusions, carries a small risk of complications such as ventricular perforation. Although surgery is a cornerstone in management, the Angio-Seal device has been used successfully in some cases to repair these tears. In this case, an Angio-Seal device effectively closed a RV rupture, with no further complication seen in follow-up exams. This suggests Angio-Seal as a potentially useful, less invasive option for treating such complications."

This led to prosthetic ring detachment and dislocation, native annular tearing, migration of the transcatheter prosthesis, and subsequent hemodynamic collapse requiring open surgery. In TMVR, prosthesis misalignment or malposition may cause annular stress during deployment and tearing of the native annulus, prosthesis embolization from suboptimal anchoring, and cardiac tamponade from left ventricular rupture, often requiring emergency surgical intervention."

    "title": "Cardiac arrest following blunt trauma-induced tension viscerothorax mimicking tension pneumothorax: A rare case report.",
    "abstract": "Tension viscerothorax is a severe condition characterized by significant increases in thoracic pressure due to the herniation of abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity. It is commonly observed in children with congenital diaphragmatic hernias or as a postoperative complication, while tension viscerothorax resulting from blunt trauma is rare. A 48-year-old male was urgently admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea following a fall from a height of 15 m. The patient, presenting in shock and based on clinical signs, was initially diagnosed with a tension pneumothorax (TPT). Bedside point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed substantial parenchymal echo abnormalities in the left thoracic cavity and cardiac displacement to the right, suggesting a left-sided tension viscerothorax. Thoracic and abdominal computed tomography confirmed the diagnosis of a rare left-sided tension viscerothorax. Due to the delayed diagnosis, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest. Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced life support, the patient regained spontaneous circulation and underwent an emergency laparotomy to reduce abdominal organs and repair a diaphragmatic hernia. Postoperatively, the patient received comprehensive medical care. The patient recovered well postsurgery and was discharged after an 18-day hospital stay. Follow-up over 2 years revealed no significant complications. Blunt trauma-induced tension viscerothorax is rare and can easily be confused with TPT, leading to misdiagnosis. Early use of bedside POCUS is recommended for suspected cases to expedite identification and management, thereby improving survival rates."

    "abstract": "Pericardial rupture with cardiac herniation is a rare injury that occurs following blunt trauma. It is even more unusual to find a pericardial tear associated with diaphragmatic injury after such trauma. Diagnosing this condition through radiologic imaging is challenging. A 51-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department after a wall collapsed on him. He reported overall body discomfort, breathlessness, chest pain, and abdominal discomfort. A plain x-ray revealed haziness in the left thoracic cavity and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with collapse of the left lung. Additionally, a gastric shadow was seen within the left hemithorax, accompanied by a mediastinal shift to the right. An x-ray of the pelvis displayed fractures at the right sacroiliac joint, left superior pubic ramus, left inferior pubic ramus, and left anterior acetabular with displacement. A computed tomography scan indicated herniation of the stomach, splenic flexure, and spleen, but there was no clear evidence of pericardial laceration. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. During the laparoscopy, a significant defect was found in the left hemidiaphragm, along with a pericardial rupture that had led to cardiac herniation and visceral herniation of the stomach, splenic flexure, and spleen through the diaphragmatic tear. The abdominal visceral organs were repositioned into the abdomen, and the diaphragm was repaired. The heart was repositioned, and the pericardial defect was closed using thoracoscopic techniques. Pericardial rupture can be effectively managed using minimally invasive surgery."

    "abstract": "The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is rising, with left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) devices emerging as viable alternatives to anticoagulation for stroke prevention in high-risk patients. Although LAAO devices reduce bleeding risks compared to traditional anticoagulants, they carry procedural risks, including pericardial effusion and tamponade. We present a case of a 70-year-old male with a history of AF who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, dizziness, and weight gain five days post-LAAO placement. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. Emergency pericardiocentesis drained 800 mL of fluid, resulting in rapid clinical improvement. The patient's recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged two days later. Pericardial effusion and tamponade are serious complications of LAAO devices, often presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Emergency physicians should be familiar with the procedure itself, its complications, and the utility of POCUS in expediting care as seen in this case."

    "abstract": "Clozapine is approved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Many cardiovascular side effects are associated with clozapine, including QTc prolongation and myocarditis, which is a black box warning. Few cases of pericarditis have been reported in recent literature. We report a case of a 26-year-old male with schizoaffective disorder who presented with sharp chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient was started on clozapine three months prior to his current presentation. The workup revealed a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology and signs consistent with acute pericarditis. He required emergent pericardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement. Symptoms resolved after treatment with ibuprofen and colchicine. This case report highlights the importance of early diagnosis of life-threatening cardiovascular complications associated with clozapine, especially acute pericarditis and cardiac tamponade due to pericardial effusion. We strongly recommend implementing monitoring protocols to prevent this potentially life-threatening adverse effect in patients taking clozapine."

This study describes the frequency and type of paediatric trauma experienced by a mature prehospital trauma service in an urban environment to inform prehospital services about the type of injuries likely to be attended, and the key interventions that might be required on scene. Retrospective review of patients 16 years of age and under attended by a physician-led prehospital trauma service between January 2017 and June 2022. Patients were divided into subgroups of 0-4 years, 5-11 years and 12-16 years. 782 paediatric patients were included, which comprised 8.3% of total patient workload. The median age was 15 years old (IQR 5-16 years) and the majority were male (n=597, 76.3%). The most common mechanism of injury for subgroups were falls from height (>2 m) in 0-4 year olds, road traffic collisions in 5-11 year olds and penetrating trauma in 12-16 year olds. 20.2% (n=158) of patients attended received critical care interventions. 9.8% (n=77) underwent prehospital emergency anaesthesia (PHEA) and 7.4% (n=58) received a blood transfusion. Paediatric major trauma constitutes only a small minority of prehospital care workload. However, cases are attended regularly. Attending prehospital teams need to be trained to perform difficult resuscitations and perform high acuity, low frequency interventions. Educational and training strategies required to equip prehospital providers treating paediatrics may include checklists, algorithms, simulation training and mental health support."

    "abstract": "Hypothyroidism, once considered a rare adverse effect of anti-tuberculosis (TB) medication, is increasingly observed in patients undergoing second-line therapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This study discusses a case involving a 17-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with sub-acute intestinal obstruction secondary to pulmonary TB. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, during which routine investigations revealed elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. A week later, a second laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, facial puffiness was noted, prompting a repeat TSH test, which indicated a significant increase from the initial levels. The diagnosis was revised to hypothyroidism potentially related to anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). While existing literature predominantly associates hypothyroidism with second-line anti-TB medications in MDR-TB patients, this study suggests a potential link between first-line ATT and hypothyroidism. This finding underscores the importance of monitoring TSH levels in patients on first-line anti-TB drugs."

    "abstract": "Emergency resuscitative thoracotomy survival rates range widely depending on the mechanism of injury and signs of life at presentation. Given ongoing shortages of blood products, we sought to examine blood product use across this patient population and corresponding survival. We identified patients in the American College of Surgeons-Trauma Quality and Improvement Program (2017-2019) undergoing an emergency resuscitative thoracotomy within 30 minutes of hospital arrival. The primary outcome was the number of packed red blood cells units transfused within 4 hours. Secondary outcomes were the number of units of plasma and platelets transfused and overall survival. The number of uvnits of blood products transfused to observe 1 survivor was calculated by dividing the total number of units transfused by the number of survivors. A total of 1,231 patients were included. The median age was 36, 84.6% were male, 69.2% had penetrating trauma, and 40.4% presented with signs of life. The overall survival was 7.3%, and the median number of packed red blood cells transfused within 4 hours was 3.7 [interquartile range, 1.0-9.4]. Patients with penetrating trauma and signs of life had a survival rate of 17.1% and received a median of 8.0 [3.0-17.0] packed red blood cells. Patients presenting with blunt trauma and no signs of life had a 1.1% survival and received a median of 2.0 packed red blood cells [0.9-6.0]. For patients with stab wounds arriving with signs of life, a total number of 30 packed red blood cell units was transfused to observe 1 survivor. For blunt trauma without signs of life, a total of 485 units were transfused to observe 1 survivor. Given the near futility of emergency resuscitative thoracotomy in patients with blunt trauma presenting with no signs of life, coupled with the ongoing national shortage of blood, we recommend allocating transfusion resources to patients with penetrating trauma and to patients with blunt trauma presenting with signs of life."

However, in sub-Saharan Africa survival rates remain low. This article shares our experience with a patient who survived a cardiac wound at our center. A 21-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with a stab wound on the chest. On arrival, he presented with signs of hemorrhagic shock and cardiac tamponade confirmed by Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) which showed a positive pericardial effusion. A cardiac wound was suspected, and the patient was transferred to the operating room by the general surgery team. The wound in the right ventricle was repaired via thoracotomy under general anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. The postoperative course was uneventful. There is still a high death rate in many parts of the world where there is no developed prehospital care system, such as Senegal. Successful management of cardiac wounds depends on early diagnosis and proper training in trauma patient care. Surgical treatment is straightforward and should be performed by a surgeon working in the emergency department. Successful management of cardiac wounds remains a significant challenge. Surgical treatment is simple in principle and should be possible for any general surgeon working in the emergency department. This positive result is a significant achievement for our medical team, our doctors in training, and the history of our center."

    "abstract": "Primary peritoneal clear cell carcinoma (PPCCC) is a rare abdominal tumor, affecting 7 out of every million people. Its vague presenting signs and symptoms often lead to delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. We present a case involving a young woman with anemia and abdominal discomfort who on further investigation had a 26-cm abdominal tumor identified to be PPCCC. Multimodal therapy with tumor debulking and chemotherapy was pursued. Given the aggressive nature of PPCCC, any clinical suspicion of peritoneal carcinoma should prompt thorough diagnostic evaluation. A 39-year-old woman with menorrhagia and peptic ulcer disease presented with abdominal discomfort of 2 days duration. She initially had headaches managed with ibuprofen. Following this, she had generalized abdominal pain with bloating that worsened with food and had no relief with use of stool softeners. She had associated dizziness with palpitations, chest pressure, and exertional dyspnea. In the emergency department, the patient was mildly tachycardic but otherwise stable. On exam, she had a distended abdomen with generalized tenderness and normoactive bowel sounds. Labs showed normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 5.2 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram and abdominal and chest X-rays were normal. A non-contrast computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a fibroid uterus and posterior displacement of multiple bowel loops by a large septate cystic mass (13.5 × 26.0 × 26.7 cm) occupying the entire abdominal cavity. Elevated CA 125 and CA 19-9 were also noted. She underwent exploratory laparotomy with mass resection, partial omentectomy, left colectomy (given extension into transverse colon), appendectomy, and total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy. Biopsy and immunohistochemical staining (positive for PAX-8, ER, P53, P16, Napsin A and negative for PR and WT-1) confirmed mass as stage IIIB PPCCC. There was no evidence of malignancy in other tissue samples. The patient was discharged with a plan for outpatient chemotherapy and genetic counseling. Given the rarity of PPCCC, our case highlights how increased clinical vigilance and prompt multidisciplinary efforts are essential for an accurate diagnosis, especially in younger patients to not delay management. Currently, there are no established management guidelines; however, initial treatment with surgical debulking followed by chemotherapy is often practiced."

    "abstract": "Tension pneumothorax (TP) is a clinical emergency that requires immediate treatment. However, there are specific cases that may be misdiagnosed as TP in clinical settings, potentially leading to iatrogenic injury. The goal of this study was to analyse and summarize instances of misdiagnosis in order to improve the clinician's ability to recognize and distinguish pseudotension pneumothorax (PTP). Cases misdiagnosed as TP were retrospectively analysed by literature retrieval, and the related clinical characteristics were summarized. A total of 45 cases were misdiagnosed as TP, including 27 (60.0%) cases of diaphragmatic hernia (DH), 9 cases of giant pulmonary bullae, 8 cases of cystic lung lesions and 1 case of pulmonary hydatid cyst. A total of 77.8% cases occurred in emergency and paediatric departments. Among patients with DH, 92.6% had the condition on the left with a younger onset age, and 85.2% presented with a history of digestive system diseases, surgery, trauma or digestive system manifestations. The onset of giant pulmonary bullae was mild, without haemodynamic abnormalities, and 66.7% of the patients were males. Cystic lung lesions occurred mainly in infants. Among 45 cases, 93.3% were misdiagnosed by chest X-ray, which showed 'pseudo-pneumothorax line', with compressed lung displaced centrifugally away from hilum. In DH, the diaphragm appeared indistinct without gastric bubbles, whereas the air-fluid level might be noted. Finally, 66.7% of patients were definitely diagnosed from computed tomography scans and others by thoracotomy, thoracic drainage, X-ray after gastric tube insertion, and so forth. Thoracic tube drainage was performed in 91.1% of patients, with 24.4% of patients draining fluid, and 9.8% of patients deteriorated after drainage. A total of 41.5% of patients suffered complications, including gastric perforation, haemopneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema. Except for 1 patient who did not report the treatment and prognosis, all other patients recovered and were discharged after treatment. Distinguishing PTP from TP is clinically challenging. A thorough medical history, detailed clinical features, chest X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography and strategic gastric tube insertion can provide important information of value for differential diagnosis. Clinicians need to think twice before placing a thoracic drainage tube to prevent additional iatrogenic injury."

We present a case of acute liver failure secondary to portal vein, hepatic artery, and common bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, requiring a same-day emergency living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). A 57-year-old man underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy at an external facility. During the operation, uncontrolled bleeding from the liver hilum led to conversion to open surgery. Despite attempts to control the bleeding with sutures, the patient developed abnormal liver enzymes postoperatively. A computed tomography scan revealed necrosis of the right liver lobe and hypoplasia of the left lobe, leading to the patient to be transferred to our center. Upon admission, the patient was found to have encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypotension, and oliguria, with elevated transaminase levels. Based on these findings, an emergency LT was deemed necessary. Due to the unavailability of a cadaveric organ, the patient's daughter was prepared as a living donor. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a necrotic right liver lobe, atrophic left lobe, transection of the right hepatic artery and common bile duct, and a thrombosed right portal vein. The patient successfully underwent LDLT from his daughter within 24 hours. At the seventh-month follow-up, he had no complications. Hepatic vascular injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy can lead to ALF, which carries a high mortality risk. In such cases, LDLT may be a life-saving strategy. Early referral of a patient with ALF to a transplant center is life-saving."

We herein present a case of solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas in an 18-year-old female patient who presented to our emergency department with features of shock following its spontaneous rupture. Imaging showed features suggestive of solid pseudopapillary tumor of pancreas, and she was managed by exploratory laparotomy following initial resuscitation. Solid pseudopapillary tumors of pancreas are one of the rare exocrine pancreatic tumors. Their origin is not exactly clear, the most accepted theory states that these tumors originate from the multipotent primordial cells. Preoperative diagnosis can be made showing features distinct from other pancreatic solid/cystic neoplasms. Surgical management is the preferred treatment modality in these tumors.

Initial X-ray was non-diagnostic, and a contrast-enhanced Computerised Tomography [CECT scan] demonstrated ascites and pneumoperitoneum that suggested hollow organ perforation. The emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a 7 cm laceration on the stomach that was surgically repaired using two-layer closure. Following that, extensive peritoneal lavage occurred.

Several prognostic indices have been developed to predict the outcomes. The present study investigated the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score and C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio as predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy at a tertiary-care hospital. Methods One hundred consecutive patients undergoing emergency laparotomy were enrolled. The APACHE II score and CRP/albumin ratio were calculated. Post-operatively, all complications (Clavien-Dindo classification) and deaths within 30 days of surgery were observed. Comparison of the receiver operating characteristic curve was performed to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of APACHE II and CRP/albumin ratio in predicting complications and mortality. Results The APACHE II score ≥13 predicted major complications with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 81%. The CRP/albumin ratio ≥5.1 was found to predict major complications with a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 93%, respectively. The AUC for the APACHE II Score and CRP/albumin ratio in predicting major complications was 0.946 and 0.97, respectively (p <0.001), thus demonstrating excellent diagnostic performance. Conclusion We found that the better parameter in terms of AUC is the CRP/albumin ratio, although statistically there was no significant difference in the diagnostic performance of the two parameters."

    "abstract": "Airway management in emergency situations poses significant challenges, particularly in patients with difficult airway anatomy or comorbid conditions. Blind nasal intubation has been explored as a rescue technique when conventional methods fail. Masseter muscle rigidity (MMR), characterized by significant jaw muscle stiffness, is a recognized complication following succinylcholine administration that can complicate traditional approaches to securing an airway. A 75-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, prior stroke with paralysis, dementia, and a seizure disorder, presented with acute hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation. Orotracheal intubation failed due to trismus despite etomidate, succinylcholine, and rocuronium. Nasal fiberoptic intubation was unsuccessful, leading to blind nasal intubation as a rescue technique using oxymetazoline and surgical lubricant, successfully guided by breath sounds. Oxygen saturation remained stable, but post-intubation imaging revealed a right-sided tension pneumothorax which was subsequently managed via percutaneous decompression. This case underlines the efficacy of blind nasal intubation as a rescue strategy in challenging airway management scenarios, particularly when conventional methods fail. While not the gold standard, blind nasal intubation offers a feasible alternative, especially in cases of limited mouth opening or compromised airway anatomy. This approach is also less invasive and requires fewer logistical resources than surgical cricothyrotomy, which typically necessitates an operating room and an ear, nose, and throat specialist."

This case report describes a novel instance of TTC in an 84-year-old woman who developed the condition following a motor vehicle accident, resulting in blunt chest trauma. Coronary artery disease was ruled out through coronary angiography, which showed no significant coronary obstruction. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation was 25-30%, indicative of severe systolic dysfunction. The patient's clinical course, diagnostic findings, and management are discussed, contributing to the literature by expanding the understanding of TTC's potential occurrence following blunt trauma. This case supports prior findings that emotional and physical stress can trigger TTC but challenges the assumption that TTC is predominantly linked to emotional triggers. It also introduces a novel aspect of TTC in the elderly, emphasizing the importance of considering this diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain and cardiac dysfunction after physical trauma."

When the etiology of arrest is unclear, particularly without clear signs of life-threatening trauma, standard basic and advanced cardiac life support (BCLS/ACLS) treatments for medical cardiac arrest is appropriate. Traumatic circulatory arrest may result from massive hemorrhage, airway obstruction, obstructive shock, respiratory disturbances, cardiogenic causes or massive head trauma. While resuscitation and/or transport is appropriate for some populations, it is appropriate to withhold or discontinue resuscitation attempts for TOHCA patients for whom these efforts are non-beneficial. This position statement and resource document were written as an update to the 2013 joint position statements. NAEMSP, ACEP, and ACS-COT recommend: EMS resuscitation of adults with TOHCA should:Prioritize prompt identification of patients who may benefit from transport to definitive care at trauma centers when safe and appropriate.Emphasize the identification of reversible causes of traumatic circulatory arrest and timely use of clinically indicated life-saving interventions (LSIs) within the EMS clinician's scope of practice. These include: External hemorrhage control with direct pressure, wound packing, and tourniquetsAirway management using the least-invasive approach necessary to achieve and maintain airway patency, oxygenation, and adequate ventilation.Chest decompression if there is clinical concern for a tension pneumothorax. Empiric bilateral decompression, however, is not indicated in the absence of suspected chest trauma.External chest compressions may be considered but only secondary to other LSIs.Epinephrine should not be routinely used, and if used should not be administered before other LSIs.If point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) demonstrates no evidence of cardiac motion, this may have utility in TOHCA management for prognostication.Emphasize that placement of cardiac monitors and/or use of POCUS should occur after indicated LSIs have been appropriately performedConditions where resuscitation attempts should be withheld, include TOHCA patients with: Injuries that are incompatible with life (e.g., decapitation, hemi-corpectomy, incineration, open skull injury with extruding brain matter).Evidence of prolonged circulatory arrest (e.g., rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decomposition).Advance care planning documents that indicate Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/ Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR)/Allow Natural Death medical orders.Conditions where resuscitation attempts are discontinued for TOHCA patients should recognize: Mechanism of injury should not be used as the sole determinant to discontinue resuscitation efforts.Electrical rhythm should not be used as the sole determinant to discontinue resuscitation efforts. Of note, non-shockable rhythms (Pulseless Electrical Activity/Asystole) are associated with an extremely low likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or survival with neurologic recovery.There is insufficient evidence to support any specific universal standardized time-based cutoffs to discontinue resuscitation efforts based on the duration of resuscitation or transport times to definitive care. EMS decisions to transport or discontinue resuscitation should be locally determined based on EMS and trauma system resources and proximity.Implementation of protocols for TOHCA should consider: Risks and benefits of resuscitation attempts and transport for public safety and EMS clinician safety.Individual patient cost and organ donation should not be a factor in EMS clinical decision-making on-scene.Local provisions for specific clinical resources (e.g. regional trauma capabilities), environmental (e.g. avalanche, etc.), or population-based situations are important and require active EMS physician oversight in collaboration with local trauma system stakeholders."

    "abstract": "Percutaneous closure of atrial septal defect (ASD) is less invasive than surgical closure and yields good results; however, cardiac erosion is a serious complication. It usually occurs within 72 h after implantation and rarely after months to years. Cardiac erosion has been rarely reported using Figulla Flex II (FFII; Occlutech, Schaffhausen, Switzerland). In this case, we encountered a case of delayed cardiac erosion after FFII implantation. An 81-year-old woman, who underwent percutaneous ASD closure elsewhere 5 years previously, presented to our hospital with sudden chest pain and was diagnosed with cardiac tamponade. She underwent emergency surgery and was diagnosed with cardiac erosion caused by FFII. The device had penetrated the aortic wall through the right atrial wall. Removal and repair were successful. Cardiac erosion can occur long after implantation; therefore, patients require careful follow-up."

    "title": "Beyond the Lungs: A Case Report of Disseminated Tuberculosis With Multisystem Involvement.",
    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by acid-fast bacillus pertaining to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Pulmonary TB is the most common presentation, resulting either from primary infection or reactivation of latent disease. In rare cases, wide dissemination of M. tuberculosis can occur, usually by hematogenous or lymphatic route, leading to multiorgan involvement and potentially life-threatening conditions known as disseminated TB. We present the case of a 55-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of inflammatory polyarthralgia and myalgia, gradually worsening in the last four months. Other symptoms included fatigue, cough with purulent sputum, and weight loss within the last month. The patient's past medical history included pulmonary silicosis and tobacco use. On physical examination, he had an emaciated appearance, fever (38.4 ºC), normal thoracic examination, and no evidence of arthritis. Blood tests displayed anemia, leucopenia, mild hepatic cytolysis, and elevated acute phase reactants. Urine sediment revealed mild hematuria with red blood cell casts. A thoraco-abdominal-pelvic computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse ground-glass peribronchovascular densification, left pleural effusion, homogenous hepatosplenomegaly, and multiple mediastinal, retroperitoneal, periportal, iliac, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. After admission, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of M. tuberculosis DNA was positive in sputum and urine. Disseminated TB, with pulmonary and renal involvement, was diagnosed, and antituberculous therapy was initiated with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Additionally, 24-hour urine was collected, and proteinuria of 1,566 mg/24 hour was evident. An ultrasound-guided percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed, revealing mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis due to immune complexes deposition. Polyarthralgia persisted with new-onset arthritis, so arthrocentesis was performed. Both mycobacteriology and PCR detection of M. tuberculosis DNA were negative. While in the ward, sudden onset dyspnea with lower limb edema developed, and jugular vein distention with hypotension was detected. Point-of-care cardiac ultrasound revealed a large volume of pericardiac effusion without cardiac tamponade. Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed. Pericardial fluid's mycobacteriology and PCR detection of M. tuberculosis DNA were negative. Six weeks after admission, M. tuberculosis was identified in Lowenstein-Jensen cultures of sputum. The patient was discharged after 145 days of hospital stay, with an indication to maintain antituberculous treatment for a minimum of 12 months, with prolonged treatment decisions dependent on clinical evolution. Twelve months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic, with analytical and imagiological improvement; therefore, antituberculous therapy was discontinued. Disseminated or miliary TB is a rare condition that poses a diagnostic challenge for every clinician, as clinical presentation is non-specific. Multiorgan involvement may impair diagnostic workup if TB is not initially suspected. Clinicians should be aware of heterogeneous disease progression, as initial detection of organ involvement does not exclude possible further disseminated disease. Diagnosis should be swift to allow early antituberculous therapy initiation and prevent potentially life-threatening situations."

We report a case of a 23-year-old male patient with HSK and a rare vascular anomaly, a right renal artery originating from the left common iliac artery, who sustained a grade V renal injury following blunt trauma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed active arterial bleeding and a retroperitoneal hematoma.

    "abstract": "Pneumoperitoneum, characterized by free air in the peritoneal cavity, typically signals significant intra-abdominal pathology, often due to perforated hollow viscera requiring urgent surgical intervention. However, spontaneous idiopathic pneumoperitoneum, particularly in pregnant patients, is rare and poorly understood. This case report details a 41-year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant status post two rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), who presented unresponsive after a suspected overdose. Initial assessments revealed abdominal distention and a CT scan indicated substantial intra-abdominal free air. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, which, surprisingly, showed no evidence of perforation or ischemia in any abdominal organs. Following surgery, the patient remained stable, was extubated on postoperative day one, and progressed to a regular diet, although she declined recommended psychiatric care for substance use disorder. This case highlights the diagnostic complexities of pneumoperitoneum in pregnancy, suggesting that factors such as trauma, physiological changes, and substance-related gastrointestinal dysmotility may contribute to this condition. The absence of identifiable perforation emphasizes the potential for benign causes, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to effectively address the needs of pregnant patients with acute abdominal symptoms."

Paraduodenal hernias represent the most common subset of all internal hernias (IHs). The symptoms are nonspecific and range from persistent abdominal discomfort to acute abdomen. An expert radiologist and a high index of suspicion of IH are required to diagnose timely and to prevent its fatal complications, such as bowel ischemia and infarction. An IH is a potentially fatal entity if misdiagnosed and not treated timely. We present a case of a 16-year-old boy managed with an exploratory laparotomy for a strangulated internal (left paraduodenal) hernia in an emergency. A total of 274 cm of small bowel was resected, and only 140 cm of jejunum was left behind. A jejunostomy was created.

This study aimed to improve diagnostic accuracy and prevent tension pneumothorax, despite limited evaluations across all lung pathologies. We examined patients admitted to Kirupananda Variyar Medical College and Hospital with blunt chest trauma from January 2021 to June 2022. Lung USG and CT of the chest were used to detect pneumothoraxes, with the goal of reducing mortality rates in severely injured patients. Out of 64 cases, 67.5% experienced blunt trauma, 20.8% had a direct chest impact, and 11.7% suffered falls from a height. USG and CT findings revealed the following: 79.2% had pneumothorax, 7.8% had pleural effusion, 28.6% had hemothorax, 22.1% had contusion, 10.4% had rib fractures with contusion, 6.5% had rib fracture + Hemothorax, and 9.1% had isolated pneumothorax. Lung ultrasound is a reliable, radiation-free method for assessing pneumothorax, pleural effusion, contusion, and hemothorax, offering a definitive, sensitive, and accurate diagnosis."

This report describes a novel technique for management of left ventricular perforation after TAVI. We performed elective transfemoral TAVI in a frail 85-year-old lady. Anatomical challenges included tortuous and horizontal aorta and a small left ventricular cavity. A 23-mm Sapien valve was implanted. She developed cardiac tamponade the next day needing emergency pericardiocentesis. Left ventricular angiogram showed perforation of the lateral wall. SURGIFLO Hemostatic Matrix was injected into the pericardial space using Agilis steerable introducer with a good outcome.

    "abstract": "Obturator hernia is a rare abdominal wall hernia (<1 % incidence) that occurs through the obturator foramen, often in elderly, emaciated women. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the abdomen and pelvis is the diagnostic modality of choice, with a high accuracy of 78 %-100 %. An 84-year-old frail woman with COPD presented with generalized abdominal pain, abdominal distention, vomiting, and right thigh pain. CECT revealed a right-sided obturator hernia causing small bowel obstruction. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a right-sided strangulated obturator hernia. Postoperatively, the patient developed septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and succumbed to death on the 5th postoperative day. Obturator hernia is a rare abdominal hernia with an incidence of 0.07-1 %, an often-overlooked condition, more common in elderly women (around 70-90 years) with risk factors like low BMI, multiparity, and chronic conditions such as COPD. It presents with nonspecific symptoms, including abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting, and is often difficult to diagnose. Early CECT has improved the preoperative diagnosis rate from 43 % to 90 %, thus playing a crucial role in preventing morbidity and mortality. Treatment is surgical, but the mortality rate is high due to delayed diagnosis, bowel strangulation, and underlying preexisting illness. Obturator hernias are a rare but important cause of small bowel obstruction, especially in elderly, frail, malnourished women without prior abdominal surgeries. Medial thigh pain and mild abdominal distension warrant high suspicion and prompt diagnosis using CECT. Early surgical intervention is critical to prevent severe complications and reduce associated morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Infective endocarditis can present with a wide range of cardiac and extra-cardiac symptoms. However, purulent pericarditis as a presenting sign has rarely been documented in the literature. We present a case of a 47-year-old woman on hemodialysis who presented to the emergency department due to dyspnea and edema in her lower extremities. A chest X-ray revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette, while a computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large pericardial effusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram indicated vegetation on the tricuspid valve and pericardial effusion, with echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade. Emergent drainage of the pericardial space was performed, during which purulent material was obtained. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was identified in blood cultures collected upon admission and in the cultures from the pericardial effusion. The patient received intensive antibiotic therapy; however, despite the treatment and after a complicated hospital course, she succumbed to the illness. Diagnosing purulent pericarditis in hemodialysis patients with infective endocarditis requires a high level of suspicion because typical symptoms of pericarditis are uncommon, and there is a tendency to initially attribute nonspecific constitutional symptoms to the underlying infection itself. Aggressive treatment with pericardial drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy may prevent catastrophic outcomes."

    "title": "Fatal Seatbelt Syndrome in an Elderly Wheelchair User: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Elderly wheelchair users face unique challenges in traffic collisions due to physiological fragility and the limitations of standard vehicle seatbelt systems. Seatbelt syndrome, a pattern of abdominal organ and spinal injuries, can be severe when seatbelts do not properly align with an individual's body configuration. Moreover, geriatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has a low survival rate, even with advanced prehospital care. This case study presents a 90-year-old woman, secured in her wheelchair with a two-point lap belt, who was involved in a low-speed rear-end collision. Initially alert, she rapidly deteriorated into shock and subsequently exhibited pulseless electrical activity (PEA), ultimately leading to her demise despite attempts at resuscitation using resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) and emergency thoracotomy. Postmortem examination revealed hepatic and splenic injuries consistent with seatbelt syndrome. The patient's advanced age, short stature, and wheelchair dependence likely contributed to excessive abdominal force and fatal hemorrhage. While REBOA can provide transient circulatory stabilization, prolonged full occlusion increases the risk of ischemic complications. Emergency thoracotomy also shows limited benefit in geriatric blunt trauma, highlighting the need for more selective criteria. This case underscores the importance of improving seatbelt restraint systems for wheelchair users, refining guidelines for REBOA and emergency thoracotomy in geriatric trauma, and implementing multifaceted prevention strategies to reduce avoidable deaths among elderly wheelchair users."

One in every 12 pregnant patients experience physical trauma during their pregnancy, but only 0.1% experience major trauma with an injury severity score (ISS) greater than fifteen. It is crucial that emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians understand the anatomic and pathophysiologic changes that impact morbidity and mortality for pregnant trauma patients so they can effectively provide life-saving interventions and resuscitation for this patient population. For injured pregnant patients who are at least 20 weeks’ gestation (or fundal height at the level of the umbilicus), manual left lateral uterine displacement should be performed whenever possible.EMS clinicians should be aware that signs of hemorrhagic shock may be subtle or delayed in injured pregnant patients.EMS clinicians should be aware of clinical characteristics unique to the pregnant patient population that require modification of typical lifesaving interventions including hemorrhage control and resuscitation, airway and ventilation management, tension pneumothorax decompression, management of burn and inhalational injuries, and pain management.For Traumatic Out of Hospital Circulatory Arrest (TOHCA) in injured pregnant patients of at least 20 weeks’ gestation, after correctable causes of TOHCA have been addressed and spontaneous circulation has not returned, if an EMS physician is present, a resuscitative hysterotomy should be initiated ideally within four minutes of maternal arrest. EMS clinicians should understand when an in-hospital resuscitative hysterotomy is indicated, provide a clear and early pre-arrival notification, and expedite transport to the closest appropriate hospital.When a pregnant patient is considering refusal of medical aid, EMS clinicians should carefully consider and discuss the potential that life-threatening risks for maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality can occur after even seemingly minor trauma.EMS clinicians should promote conversations regarding injury prevention strategies unique to pregnancy, such as correct seatbelt use.EMS clinicians should consider the possibility of intimate partner violence when caring for injured pregnant patients."

    "abstract": "Spinal motion restriction (SMR) is commonly applied to injured children with potential cervical spine injuries (CSI). There are, however, risks to indiscriminate SMR application. We recently derived the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) CSI clinical prediction rule. Effective implementation of this prediction rule requires an accurate understanding of current emergency medical services (EMS) SMR practices. Little is known about the prevalence of prehospital SMR application in children. Our primary objective was to determine the proportion of children sustaining blunt trauma who are placed in SMR by EMS. Our secondary objective was to identify factors associated with SMR placement. We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected during a prospective study of children 0-17 years with blunt trauma transported by EMS to one of 18 PECARN-affiliated emergency departments. Prehospital clinicians completed surveys regarding CSI risk factors and SMR application. We summarized SMR prevalence, techniques used, reasons for application, and clinician suspicion for CSI by patient age. We conducted univariable and multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with SMR placement. Of 13,453 children transported by EMS, we enrolled a convenience sample of 7,721 (57.4%) of whom 1.6% had a CSI and 41.5% had SMR placed. Older children were more likely to have SMR placed (35.5-50.4%) compared to those < 2 years (22.0%). Factors associated with SMR placement included patient demographics (non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, age >2 years), mechanisms of injury (high-risk motor vehicle crash (MVC), unrestrained MVC passenger, high-risk fall, axial load), clinical history (loss of consciousness, self-reported neck pain, paresthesia, numbness, or extremity weakness) and physical examination findings (altered mental status, neck tenderness, inability to move neck, focal neurological deficits, and substantial head or torso injuries). Of children transported by EMS after blunt trauma in this study, 41.5% had SMR placed, while only 1.6% had CSIs. Factors associated with SMR placement included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, history, and examination findings. Many of these factors are not in the new PECARN CSI clinical prediction rule. Implementation of a risk-centered EMS decision aid for SMR in children after blunt trauma must address this discrepancy."

    "abstract": "Tracheal injuries due to blunt force trauma are rare yet life-threatening conditions, comprising only 4% of chest trauma cases. Diagnosis is often delayed, increasing the risk of severe complications. This report describes a unique case of tracheal obstruction caused by thyroid gland extension into the trachea following blunt trauma, which was managed successfully with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and surgery. A 50-year-old male presented with severe respiratory distress following a seizure-induced fall at his residence. On arrival at the hospital, the patient was in respiratory failure with an SpO2 of 92% on a 10 L/min reservoir mask, had severe subcutaneous emphysema, and an upper airway stridor. Computed tomography revealed mediastinal emphysema and a 13-mm endotracheal mass obstructing the trachea. Flexible bronchoscopy indicated a suspected tracheal tumor, but intubation was unsuccessful due to bleeding and obstruction. Emergency tracheostomy was considered but deemed risky because imaging showed that the distal trachea was located near the sternum's suprasternal margin. The patient's respiratory distress worsened, and his SpO2 dropped to 86%. Venovenous ECMO was then administered, stabilizing his condition. Surgical intervention was performed to address the endotracheal mass and tracheal injury. A transverse neck incision allowed dissection and identification of the tracheal injury, revealing the inferior thyroid gland which extended into the tracheal lumen. Pathological examination confirmed the endotracheal mass as normal thyroid tissue. Tracheal anastomosis was successfully completed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 without complications. This case highlights an unusual presentation of tracheal obstruction caused by thyroid gland extension into the trachea following blunt trauma. Rapid initiation of ECMO enabled successful airway management and surgical repair. Recognizing atypical presentations of tracheal injuries is critical in trauma cases, as prompt intervention can prevent further complications and improve patient outcomes. This case underscores the importance of tailored airway management and the potential role of ECMO in cases of similar complex airway obstructions."

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic hernias can be congenital or acquired, with trauma being the primary cause of the latter. Both types may have delayed presentations, with abdominal organs protruding into the thoracic cavity, causing symptoms of varying severity. Pregnancy can sometimes precipitate the condition. Tension pneumothorax resulting from bowel perforation into the thorax is exceptionally rare, with only a few cases reported. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the third documented case of a late-presenting trauma-related diaphragmatic hernia during pregnancy, complicated by tension pneumothorax. A 30-year-old woman, 29 weeks pregnant, was referred to Semmelweis University emergency department with moderate dyspnea. Initial investigation revealed tension pneumothorax. Chest tube placement released air, pus, and feces. Computer tomography identified a diaphragmatic hernia with bowel incarceration and perforation as the underlying cause. The patient underwent a delayed cesarean section and surgical repair, with a good outcome. A history of thoracic trauma eight years prior was later revealed. Evaluating pregnant patients with shortness of breath in the emergency department is challenging. Identifying a history of thoracic or abdominal trauma is crucial, as this can raise the suspicion of diaphragmatic hernia, which can present with a wide range of symptoms. Spontaneous tension pneumothorax in pregnant women is extremely rare and requires cautious management. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for the successful treatment of maternal diaphragmatic hernia."

Patients with thoracic gunshot wounds who underwent eFAST between 2017 and 2021 were included from a local trauma registry. Performance metrics for each component of eFAST in each window and pathological condition were analyzed across the entire population, as well as within two cohorts: survived and deceased patients. Chest tube placement rates were compared within true-positive and false-negative (FN) eFAST results for subgroups with pneumothorax or hemothorax. A total of 288 patients were included (male, 91% male; Injury Severity Score ≥15, 48%; and died, 17%). Thirty-nine percent required chest tube, and 18% required urgent thoracic surgical intervention. Although specificity was high (91-100%) for all components, the sensitivity was less than 50% for all thoracic views, except for \"no cardiac motion\" (100% sensitivity). Sensitivity for pericardial fluid was 47%; for pneumothorax, 22%; for hemothorax, 36%; and for peritoneal fluid, 51% in the total population. Comparing survived versus deceased cohort, the eFAST sensitivity was higher among deaths for all components. The majority of patients (>70%) with a FN eFAST for pneumothorax or hemothorax received chest tube. The eFAST examination showed highly variable performance metrics among patients with penetrating thoracic trauma, with all thoracic components demonstrating high specificity but low overall sensitivity.

The survival outcomes and the factors that influence survival in these patients remain an area of interest for trauma care providers. Objective The objective of the study is to assess the survival rate and factors influencing the survival of patients undergoing emergency thoracotomy due to penetrating thoracic trauma. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the thoracic surgery, accident, and emergency department of Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 85 patients who underwent emergency thoracotomy following penetrating trauma between July 2019 and June 2024 were included. Data were extracted from the health information management system (HIMS) and analyzed using SPSS. The study reviewed demographic details, severity of injury, operative details, and postoperative outcomes. Statistical analyses included univariate analysis using chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for categorical data and independent t-tests for continuous variables. Results The study included 85 patients with a mean age of 25.72±7.84 years. The majority of patients were male (81/85, 95.29%), while females accounted for a smaller proportion (4/85, 4.71%), and gunshot trauma accounted for the most frequent cause of penetrating injury (50/85, 58.8%). The time to thoracotomy was within 60 minutes of admission, with a mean time of 48±16.5 minutes. A total of 61/85 (71.5%) patients had isolated thoracic injuries, and 24/85 (28.2%) had associated injuries, with 24/85 (28.2%) patients requiring concomitant laparotomy. The overall mortality rate was 9/85 (10.5%), with 7/9 (77.7%) of deaths occurring intraoperatively. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with combined thoracotomy and laparotomy procedures. Prolonged hospital stays and higher transfusion requirements were observed in gunshot wound victims (50/85, 58.8%). Conclusions Emergency thoracotomy for penetrating thoracic trauma has a significant mortality rate in patients with combined thoracic and abdominal injuries. Factors such as the mechanism of injury, associated injuries, and the need for additional procedures (e.g., laparotomy) influence survival outcomes. Early intervention and proper management of associated injuries are crucial for improving survival rates in these patients."

Life-threatening complications were not different between groups (cardiac tamponade: 2.2% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.56; stroke: 0.9% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.67). Seven ED patients (3.1%) died unrelated to the procedure during hospitalization vs. none in the elective CA-VA group. Emergency admission (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.48-6.38), age (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.22-3.70), and heart failure (OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.96-4.15) were independently associated with periprocedural complications and overall death during hospitalization. Patients with VA admitted via the ED were older, sicker, and more often presented with ventricular tachycardia than elective CA-VA patients. Immediate CA-VA was associated with higher rates of periprocedural complications, driven by thromboembolic events; however, no procedure-related death occurred."

    "abstract": "Pericardial effusions, though relatively rare, can lead to life-threatening complications such as cardiac tamponade. While viral etiologies are common culprits, rapid and accurate diagnosis remains challenging. We present the case of a 74-year-old male with a history of upper respiratory infection who developed sudden onset dyspnea and chest discomfort. Bedside point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed a large pericardial effusion, prompting urgent intervention. Despite initially stable vital signs, the patient rapidly deteriorated, necessitating emergent pericardiocentesis. Laboratory findings and pathology results eventually ruled out common viral causes, guiding diagnosis toward coxsackieviruses A and B, echovirus, adenoviruses, or influenza. This case highlights the critical role of POCUS in resident-led community hospitals, in expediting the diagnosis of pericardial effusions and underscores the need for prompt intervention in cases of cardiac tamponade to prevent adverse outcomes."

We report a case of a primigravid woman who complained of middle-upper abdominal pain. She was admitted to our department at 24 + 6 weeks of in vitro fertilization gestation with a surgical history of endometriosis. The patient's non-specific presentation posed diagnostic difficulties and intestinal obstruction was initially suspected. Emergent computed tomographic findings showed massive free abdominal fluid, which was suspected to have arisen from the left ovary or uterus. During an emergency exploratory laparotomy, she had interrupted suturing of a ruptured left uterine subserosal vein performed. Computed tomographic imaging is more helpful for isolating the source of bleeding than ultrasound. Prompt action of an exploratory laparotomy can result in favorable outcomes for the mother and newborn in spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a recognized hematological malignancy that typically appears in two specific age groups: the first peak occurs between 15 and 40 years of age, while the second peak arises in individuals aged over 60. While typically presenting as a mediastinal mass, rarer initial presentations include cardiac tamponade. In this case, we report a pediatric patient with HL presenting with massive pericardial effusion in the emergency department. We emphasize how a simple cytology test can facilitate diagnosis in such cases and discuss the role of cytological evaluation in guiding management. A 13-year-old male presented to our institution with fever and breathlessness. Radiological examinations indicated a mediastinal mass lesion. An emergency echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion, which was subsequently drained and sent for cytological evaluation. Cytology revealed large atypical cells characterized by abundant cytoplasm, large nuclei, and prominent nucleoli, corresponding to Reed-Sternberg cells. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) on the cell block further confirmed the diagnosis of HL. Treatment commenced following biopsy confirmation, yielding favorable prognostic results from the patient's perspective. The primary goal of presenting this case is to underscore the unusual early presentation of HL and to illustrate how a simple test, combined with comprehensive diagnostic reasoning, can enable early diagnosis and enhance prognostic outcomes. Furthermore, we highlight the crucial role of ICC in the timely identification of this condition."

    "abstract": "Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) presents a critical challenge in trauma care, often occurring rapidly after injury before effective interventions are available. To evaluate the association of prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy with survival outcomes for TCA. This retrospective cohort study examined all cases of prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy for TCA in London from January 1999 to December 2019. Data were analyzed from July 2022 to July 2023. Prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy for TCA. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included survival to hospital admission and neurological status at discharge. Prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy was undertaken in 601 patients with out-of-hospital TCA. The median (IQR) age was 25 (20-37) years; 538 (89.5%) were male and 63 (10.5%) female. A total of 529 patients (88.0%) had a penetrating mechanism of injury. TCA occurred at a median (IQR) of 12 (6-22) minutes after the emergency call, with 491 arrests (81.7%) before the advanced trauma team's arrival. TCA was the result of cardiac tamponade (105 patients, 17.5%), exsanguination (418 patients, 69.6%), and exsanguination combined with cardiac tamponade (72 patients, 12.0%). Thirty patients (5.0%) survived to hospital discharge, with a favorable neurological outcome observed in 23 survivors (76.6%). Survival varied significantly with the cause of TCA: 22 of 105 patients (21%) with cardiac tamponade, 8 of 418 patients (1.9%) with exsanguination, and none of the 72 patients with combined or other pathologies survived. There were no survivors beyond 15 minutes of TCA for cardiac tamponade and 5 minutes after exsanguination. Multivariable analysis revealed that the cause of TCA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 21.1; 95% CI, 8.1-54.7; P < .001), duration of TCA (aOR, 20.9; 95% CI, 4.4-100.6, P < .001), and absence of the need for internal cardiac massage (AOR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.5; P = .001) were independently associated with survival. TCA occurs soon after injury, with only a brief window available for effective intervention. This study found that resuscitative thoracotomy is feasible in a mature, physician-led, urban prehospital system and is associated with improved survival for patients with out-of-hospital TCA, particularly when caused by cardiac tamponade, in situations where other treatment options are limited."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Cardiac tamponade is managed through echo- or fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous pericardiocentesis. The European Society of Cardiology's Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases proposed a triage strategy for these patients. This study evaluated the triage score and compared the safety and efficacy of fluoroscopy- versus echo-guided procedures without additional visualization control. Materials and Methods: This prospective observational study included 71 patients with cardiac tamponade from February 2021 to June 2022. Pericardiocentesis was performed using fluoroscopy or echo guidance based on clinical assessment and catheterization laboratory availability, without the additional control of needle/guidewire position or ECG monitoring. Patients were followed for three months. Results: The study included 71 patients (52.1% female, mean age 59.7 ± 15.7 years). Malignancy was the most common comorbidity (59.2%). Echo criteria led to urgent procedures in 47.9%, with subcostal access used most often (60.6%), particularly in fluoroscopy-guided procedures (93.8%, p = 0.003). The success rate was 97.1%, with minor complications in 14% of patients. Diabetes and malignancy predicted complications regardless of access site or guiding method. The triage score did not affect complication rates or short-term mortality. Conclusions: Fluoroscopy- and echo-guided pericardiocentesis without additional visualization control showed no difference in safety or efficacy. Delaying the procedure for patients with a triage score ≥6, or performing it early for those with a low score, did not impact complication rates or mortality, which were more influenced by the progression of the underlying disease."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Detection of blunt traumatic diaphragm injury (TDI) can be challenging in the absence of surgical exploration. Our objective is to study the mechanisms of injury and detection modes for patients with blunt TDI. Methods: This is a single-center, retrospective review conducted in a level 1 trauma center from 2016 to 2023, inclusive. We identified seven patients with blunt TDI using the primary mechanisms and trauma type. Results: Out of seven patients, two were associated with motor vehicle collisions, four were pedestrians struck, and one fell down the stairs. The mean ISS was 48.4 (29-75). Of the seven patients with blunt TDI, four died in the trauma bay-two from traumatic arrest and two died spontaneously. Multiple rib fractures were one of the common injury patterns in six cases, whereas in the remaining case, blunt TDI was confirmed at laparotomy and repaired. One patient died two days after admission. Of the two patients who survived, one had a TDI identified during video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for retained hemothorax, and one patient had a TDI repaired during emergent exploratory laparotomy for other injuries. In the remaining four patients, blunt TDI was confirmed based on their autopsy reports. Conclusions: Injuries in all seven cases were sustained with a high-energy injury mechanism. Multiple rib fractures were reported in six cases. Based on our findings, we recommend that clinicians maintain a high level of suspicion for blunt TDI in patients with thoracoabdominal trauma, especially in cases with rib fractures or high-impact trauma."

    "abstract": "Cases of Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) have been associated with high mortality rates and frequently require emergency exploratory laparotomy. However, the widespread utilization of computed tomography (CT) scans has revealed that HPVG is often connected to benign conditions, as demonstrated by numerous studies. Given the intricate nature of the underlying causes of HPVG, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the necessity of emergency surgical exploration for patients with HPVG. An octogenarian female patient was admitted to the emergency department due to abdominal pain, accompanied by symptoms of nausea and vomiting. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a significant presence of radiolucency in the peripheral branching of the liver, indicating the existence of portal venous gas. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to the Emergency Intensive Care Unit for further management. Colonoscopy of the patient reveals features consistent with ischemic colitis, characterized by mucosal congestion, edema, erosion, ulcers, with some ulcers covered by pseudomembranes. After undergoing a series of conservative treatments, the patient's condition improved, as confirmed by a follow-up CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis conducted 8 days later, which showed complete absorption of the gas. Consequently, the patient was discharged from the hospital. The management of HPVG should take into account the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation, and should be tailored towards addressing the root cause. The selection of surgical or conservative intervention should be guided by the underlying etiology, while the prognosis and outcome of HPVG are contingent upon the underlying cause."

Prompt recognition and surgical intervention are critical to prevent fatal complications. A 30-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of generalized abdominal pain along with coffee-ground vomiting and absolute constipation. Clinical evaluation revealed a febrile, dehydrated, and tachycardic patient with a tense, tender, and distended abdomen. Radiological investigations, including a CT abdomen, demonstrated gastric distension, air-fluid levels, thickened gastric walls, and prominent intramural gas along the greater curvature without evidence of perforation. Endoscopy typically reveals a purplish discoloration of the gastric mucosa, covered with necrotic debris. However, in this case endoscopy was avoided due to strong clinical and radiological suspicion of acute necrotizing gastritis, the patient's hemodynamic instability and potential risk of gastric perforation. Exploratory laparotomy revealed gangrenous changes involving the fundus and a longitudinal strip of gastric tissue along the greater curvature, with a width around a third of the stomach, sparing the lesser curvature and gastroesophageal junction. The longitudinal strip of gangrenous segment was resected, and the stomach was repaired using a double-layer technique. Histopathology confirmed gastric mucosal necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration, and tissue cultures revealed hemolytic streptococci. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on the 12th postoperative day. This case underscores the importance of considering acute necrotizing gastritis as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and gastric distension, even in the absence of traditional risk factors. Prompt surgical intervention is critical to avoid life-threatening complications. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis and refine the management of this rare condition."

However, imaging revealed pneumoperitoneum with multiple air pockets, suggesting intestinal perforation. Exploratory laparotomy uncovered no bowel perforation but revealed a 2x2 cm uterine fundal perforation with pus drainage. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. Histopathology confirmed acute necrotizing inflammation extending into the myometrium, with no malignancy detected. Therefore, early diagnosis and surgical intervention, including hysterectomy, are critical for reducing the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. Hence, this case underscores the importance of considering uterine perforation as a differential diagnosis in elderly postmenopausal women presenting with acute abdomen for which prompt surgical management is essential to ensure a favorable outcome."

Despite this, concerns exist over the potential for DPA/DPL to delay transfer to the operating room (OR). We hypothesized that DPA/DPL application in severely hypotensive BTPs would lead to increased OR transfer time and in-hospital mortality. The 2017-2019 TQIP database was queried for adult BTPs presenting with severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure <70 mmHg) who underwent any operative intervention within two-hours. Using a 1:2 propensity-score model, patients who underwent DPA/DPL within one-hour of arrival were compared with those who did not, controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, ≥6 units of packed red cells within 4 h, and injury profile. From 5514 patients, 62 (1.1 %) underwent DPA/DPL. We matched 52 DPA/DPL patients to 104 patients not undergoing DPA/DPL. There were no differences in the matched variables between cohorts (all p > 0.05). Compared to those not undergoing DPA/DPL, patients undergoing DPA/DPL had a higher rate/risk of in-hospital complications (59.6 % vs. 39.4 %, p = 0.02) (OR 2.27, CI 1.15-4.47, p = 0.02) but statistically similar rate/risk of death (65.4 % vs. 50.0 %, p = 0.07) (OR 1.89, CI 0.95-3.76, p = 0.07). Time to OR was similar between both groups (DPA/DPL 39 min vs. non-DPA/DPL 42 min, p = 0.87). DPA or DPL used within the first hour of arrival does not appear to delay time to OR and does not increase risk of death. This challenges concerns over potential DPA/DPL-associated delays and heightened mortality risks."

A wound's dehiscence is linked to severe morbidity and mortality. This study examined how rapidly abdominal burst and wound dehiscence could be identified in patients after both emergency and scheduled laparotomies. This prospective study included 80 patients with burst abdomens, aged more than 18, who underwent exploratory laparotomies in the Department of General Surgery, LLR, and associated hospitals, Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College from January 2021 to October 2022. Various factors were observed, such as postoperative wound infection, nutritional status, raised intra-abdominal pressure, type of pathology, and patients undergoing emergency or elective exploratory laparotomy. The presence of intra-abdominal sepsis (63.75%), anemia (61.25%), and hypoproteinemia (50%) favors a higher incidence of burst abdomen as preoperative risk factors. Among various pathologies, gastro-duodenal perforation (30.0%) was found to be the most common pathology associated with a burst abdomen. In the postoperative period, wound infection (77.5.0%) was the most common factor associated with a burst abdomen, followed by raised intra-abdominal pressure (due to cough (35%), vomiting (17.5%)), and postoperative abdominal distension (27.5%). Intra-abdominal pressure was found to be a very sensitive early predictor of wound dehiscence, with peak incidence on POD-6 (IAP>16 mmHg). Emergency procedures are more likely than elective surgeries to result in a burst abdomen. Anemia and wound infection both raise the risk of abdominal rupture. Intra-abdominal pressure was found to be a very sensitive early predictor of wound dehiscence. In both the treatment and prevention of this disorder, adherence to good methods and serious attempts to reduce the influence of predisposing variables are much more important."

In this case report, we report a complex scenario in which a patient initially admitted for perforated appendicitis developed necrotizing pancreatitis during the hospital stay. Necrotizing pancreatitis is a rare clinical outcome, and by examining potential factors that contributed to this patient's condition, we offer insights into how to assess and potentially prevent future cases of necrotizing pancreatitis in similar patients. An 83-year-old male with a complex past medical history, including coronary artery disease with 12 cardiac stents, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a prior pulmonary embolism, presented to the emergency department with acute-onset right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. He was diagnosed with acute appendicitis with micro-perforations and underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy and lysis of adhesions. Postoperatively, the patient developed hypotension and tachycardia, requiring vasopressor support, as well as hematemesis and sepsis. A CT scan revealed a partially necrotic pancreas, prompting an exploratory laparotomy and pancreatic debridement. Blood cultures identified Candida glabrata, leading to the initiation of antifungal therapy. Despite aggressive critical care, including multiple abdominal surgeries, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antifungal treatment, the patient developed multiorgan failure. On day 16, after going into cardiac arrest, the patient was pronounced deceased.  This case highlights the importance of early diagnostic strategies for high-risk patients with possible overlapping symptoms in the setting of acute abdominal pain. A broader scope of clinical assessments with timely intervention and aggressive management may be crucial in preventing severe outcomes, such as necrotizing pancreatitis."

From November 7, 2008, to June 19, 2020, 40 cases of total-body CT images for blunt trauma with multiple injuries, were collected from the emergency department of Osaka General Medical Center and randomly divided into two groups. In half of the cases, the Uni-CT algorithm using semantic segmentation assigned visibility-friendly window settings to each organ. Four physicians with varying levels of experience interpreted 20 cases using the algorithm and 20 cases in conventional settings. The performance was analyzed based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity of the target findings, and diagnosis speed. In the proposal and conventional groups, patients had an average of 2.6 and 2.5 targeting findings, mean ages of 51.8 and 57.7 years, and male proportions of 60% and 45%, respectively.

Sufficiently powered studies are lacking, and recommendations for management remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify key predictors of pathologic PI using physical examination, laboratory, and radiographic findings. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two quaternary academic centers (2010-2020). A total of 334 consecutive patients 18 years or older with radiographic evidence of PI were identified. Patients were excluded if they pursued comfort care or if there was concurrent radiographic evidence of vaso-occlusive process. Pathologic PI was defined as presence of ischemic and/or perforated bowel on exploratory laparotomy or death prior to planned surgery. Of the 334 patients included in our study, 91 (27%) underwent exploratory laparotomy, of which 59 (65%) had ischemic and/or perforated bowel. These latter patients and 10 other patients who died before exploratory laparotomy defined the pathologic PI cohort. A stepwise model was created for predicting pathologic disease. Significant predictors were the presence of portal venous gas, multisegment PI, vasopressor use, peritonitis, increasing leukocyte count, and end organ injury, which were used to construct a nomogram for clinical use. A nomogram score based on presence of portal venous gas, multisegment PI, vasopressor use, peritonitis, leukocytosis, and end organ injury may help predict the probability of pathologic PI and therefore can inform surgical decision making.

    "abstract": "Out-of-hospital traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA), a sudden loss of heart function caused by severe trauma such as blunt, penetrating, or other injuries, presents significant public health challenges due to its high severity and extremely low survival rates. Approximately 2.7% of trauma patients experience cardiac arrest at the scene, with an overall survival rate of less than 5%. The correlations of prognosis with various transport approach, such as hospital level with different distance, are yet to be clarified. Thus, we conducted this study to assess the association of transporting TCA patients to hospitals of different levels and distances on critical outcomes, including the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to admission, and 30-day survival. This retrospective study included adults with TCA who were admitted to various emergency departments in Taoyuan City between January 2016 and December 2022. The patients were stratified by destination hospital into three groups: those transported to a trauma center (TC; TC group), those transported to the nearest non-TC (non-TC group), and those cross-regionally transported to a TC (cross-region TC group). Geographic information system (GIS) data were utilized to determine hospital locations and distances. The associations between various factors and key outcomes-any return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival to admission, 24-h survival and 30-day survival-were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of these outcomes based on transportation to hospitals of different levels. This study included 557 patients with TCA (TC: 190 [direct transport: 72; cross-region transport: 118]; non-TC: 367). The TC and cross-region TC groups demonstrated significantly higher rates of ROSC at 30.6% and 30.5%, respectively, as well as lower mortality rates (95.8% for both), compared to the non-TC group, which had a ROSC rate of 12.0% and a mortality rate of 99.5%. Multivariable analysis revealed significant associations between favorable outcomes and transportation to a trauma center, either directly (aOR 2.91, 95% CI 1.54-5.49) or via cross-region transfer (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.01-4.15). Furthermore, blunt trauma was significantly associated with a poorer survival prognosis (aOR 0.31, 95% CI 0.08-0.78). This study highlights the positive associations of direct or cross-region transportation to a TC on the outcomes of TCA. Our findings challenge the current EMT transport approach in Taiwan, which prioritizes transporting TCA patients to the nearest hospital regardless of its level, potentially leading to worse outcomes. Transport time and TC distance may not significantly influence prognosis. Bypassing and directly transporting to a TC within the observed (10 km) distances are associated with better survival rates in patients with TCA. Furthermore, blunt TCA is associated with a poorer survival prognosis compared to other mechanisms of trauma-induced cardiac arrest."

Following diagnosis and treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a small pericardial effusion was noticed on computed tomography (CT) scan. Despite an initially reassuring hospital course, rapid decompensation and expansion of his purulent pericardial effusion led to his death within 24 hours of presentation. A post-mortem review of his CT imaging revealed an inconspicuous PEF. It is essential to maintain a high suspicion of PEF/AEF in patients presenting after AF ablation with suggestive symptoms, such as fever, chest pain/odynophagia, and neurological deficits. CT chest is the most common diagnostic modality and surgical correction is the treatment of choice. Pericardial/atrial oesophageal fistula is a devastating complication of atrial fibrillation ablation and early detection is the keystone of effective management.Urgent surgical repair is the most effective treatment to prevent mortality.Preventative measures include power titration, limiting energy delivery times, and avoiding overlapping ablation lines during the ablation procedure."

    "title": "Viable Ileosigmoid Knotting, A Very Phenomenon Finding and Rare Cause of Intestinal Obstruction: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
    "abstract": "Ileosigmoid knotting is the wrapping of an active component of either the ileum or the sigmoid colon over each other. It is an unusual cause of intestinal obstruction, accounting for 1-2% of cases of all mechanical obstruction in the majority published literatures. A viable knot is a unique phenomenon of this seldom cause of bowel obstruction. A sixteen-year-old female patient presents with a complaint of central abdominal distension and obstipation of 12-hour duration. Later, she also developed abdominal cramps and vomiting of ingested matter. Her vital signs were all in the normal range, and the abdominal examination was positive for a grossly distended abdomen with mild upper and central abdominal tenderness. The ileosigmoid knotting was clearly visible on the computed tomography. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a viable ileosigmoid knot was identified. Unknotting, derotation, and decompression of the sigmoid colon were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. Ileosigmoid knotting is a rare, life-threatening cause of intestinal obstruction with rapid progression to intestinal vascular compromise and gangrene. It is a hyperactive segment of ileum that winds around the pedicle of the redundant sigmoid colon, resulting in a closed-loop obstruction. There are different classification schemes of ileosigmoid knotting depending on the active component of the knot and based on the viability of the bowel and physiology of the patient. Preoperative diagnosis of this condition is often challenging and usually confirmed intraoperative. A high index of suspicion and prompt surgical exploration are crucial for the best outcome of the patient. Despite being a rare cause of intestinal obstruction, ileosigmoid knotting poses a significant morbidity and mortality to the patient. Management of a patient with viable ileosigmoid knotting is controversial, as some scholars suggest non-resective options and others recommend resective treatment as a recurrence preventive measure."

In the initial evaluation, the patient was haemodynamically unstable and had an extensive abdominal haematoma. Abdominal ultrasound revealed fetal death and a significant quantity of intra-abdominal free fluid. An emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed, confirming a transverse uterine rupture, significant haemoperitoneum, and a dead fetus in the peritoneal cavity. Additional injuries included right infundibulopelvic ligament haematoma, rectus abdominis muscle section, dorsal vertebral body fracture and rib and ileopubic branch fractures.

    "abstract": "The incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is rising, with cardiac rupture accounting for approximately 2% of deaths in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Ventricular free wall rupture (FWR) occurs in approximately 2% of AMI patients and is notably rare in patients with non-STEMI. Types of cardiac rupture include left ventricular FWR, ventricular septal rupture, and papillary muscle rupture. The FWR usually leads to acute cardiac tamponade or electromechanical dissociation, where standard resuscitation efforts may not be effective. Ventricular septal rupture and papillary muscle rupture often result in refractory heart failure, with mortality rates over 50%, even with surgical or percutaneous repair options. We present a rare case of an acute non-STEMI patient who suffered sudden FWR causing cardiac tamponade and loss of consciousness immediate before undergoing coronary angiography. Prompt resuscitation and emergency open-heart repair along with coronary artery bypass grafting resulted in successful patient recovery. This case emphasizes the risks of AMI complications, shares a successful treatment scenario, and discusses measures to prevent such complications."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Constrictive pericarditis is a chronic inflammatory process characterized by fibrosis and impaired ventricular filling. The diagnosis is challenging because of overlapping clinical features with other pathologies such as cardiac tamponade, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. We report a case of effusive-constrictive pericarditis with cardiac tamponade in a patient with a history of multiple myeloma, bone marrow transplantation, and colchicine treatment. CASE REPORT A 62-year-old woman was admitted to a hospital in Germany due to cardiac tamponade secondary to bacterial pericardial effusion that necessitated emergency sternotomy and pericardial washout. After a prolonged and complicated hospital course, she flew back to Orlando and presented on her day of arrival because of progressive dyspnea. A computed tomographic angiogram of the chest ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed a moderate pericardial effusion with a mass effect on the right ventricle showing a recurrent cardiac tamponade. Echocardiography suggested the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Cardiac catheterization showed a mean right atrial pressure of 25 mmHg and a simultaneous left and right ventricular pressure waveform of ventricular interdependence, diagnostic of effusive-constrictive pericarditis. Colchicine, along with heart failure core measures, were started and resulted in symptomatic improvement. Her first pericardial effusion was bacterial, while the second was possibly a consequence of the cardiac surgery. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac catheterization has been the criterion standard for diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. Colchicine may be curative for individuals exhibiting subacute symptoms. This case highlights the presentation and diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis, which can be associated with cardiac tamponade."

    "abstract": "Auricular hematoma is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department among patients presenting with trauma to the ear. It may result in several complications such as perichondritis and cauliflower ear if not managed appropriately. This narrative review provides an evidence-based summary of the evaluation and management of auricular hematoma. Auricular hematoma is most commonly associated with shearing or blunt trauma to the ear, resulting in formation of a hematoma within the subperichondrial space. This hematoma obstructs the nutrient supply from the perichondrium to the avascular cartilage. Without a nutrient supply, the ear is at risk for infection, necrosis, and fibrocartilaginous deposition causing cauliflower ear. If a fluctuant hematoma is present within the cartilaginous auricle within 7 days of injury, evacuation should be offered. Prior to the procedure, analgesia should be performed using an auricular block. The hematoma can then be evacuated via needle aspiration or incision and drainage followed by a bolster compression dressing to prevent reaccumulation of blood within this potential space. Despite limited data, 7-10 days of antibiotics are currently recommended with coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eg, fluoroquinolones in adults, amoxicillin-clavulanate in children). This may mitigate the risk of perichondritis. Patients should be reevaluated at 24-48 hours and abstain from contact sports for at least 2 weeks. Emergency clinicians must be knowledgeable regarding the evaluation and management of auricular hematoma, including the various drainage techniques."

Exploratory laparotomy followed by transverse colectomy was performed. The pathological examination of the specimen revealed a colonic diaphragmatic ring secondary to chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This condition primarily affects elderly women exposed to chronic NSAID therapy. It results from mucosal ulceration followed by submucosal inflammation and fibrosis.

These injuries, often termed \"white-eyed blowout\" fractures due to the absence of significant external signs, demand careful clinical and radiological evaluation. We present the case of a 15-year-old male who experienced diplopia and restricted upward gaze following blunt trauma to the left eye. Despite the lack of periorbital edema or hemorrhage, CT imaging revealed inferior rectus muscle entrapment, characterized by the tear-drop sign. Emergency surgical intervention within 8 hours successfully released the entrapped muscle, and a Vicryl mesh was placed to prevent re-entrapment. Postoperative care included anti-inflammatory treatment, with follow-up demonstrating significant improvement in ocular mobility and resolution of diplopia. This case underscores the critical role of prompt recognition, high-resolution CT imaging, and timely surgical intervention in the management of pediatric orbital trapdoor fractures to prevent long-term functional impairments."

    "abstract": "Dengue fever encompasses a spectrum of illnesses, ranging from mild dengue fever to more severe forms, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Cardiogenic shock and multi-organ failure are among the complications that can arise from the syndrome, which is considered to be caused by endothelial cell loss and increased capillary permeability. Its incidence is especially significant during monsoon seasons. A 45-year-old woman required intubation after presenting with hypotension and changed mental status after suffering from a high-grade fever, severe headache, myalgias, and progressive respiratory distress for seven days. An emergency was called when imaging indicated a considerable pericardial effusion, which echocardiography verified. Pericardiocentesis was carried out, and 300 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was collected. She then required inotropic therapy to avoid cardiogenic shock. After receiving empirical antibiotics, platelet transfusions, and close supervision, the patient's health improved, and the pericardial drain was removed on the fifth day of hospitalization. Since myocarditis and pericardial effusion are uncommon but hazardous cardiac symptoms in dengue fever, it is critical to detect and treat these disorders in patients with severe dengue fever to limit the illness's morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Owing to the time-sensitive nature of myocardial ischemia, challenging clinical scenarios should be considered in patients with type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD) complicated by coronary malperfusion. In clinical settings, the diagnosis and reperfusion strategies for coronary malperfusion often depend on institutional resources. This study evaluated early surgical outcomes in such patients, focusing on transportation type and clinical management. We retrospectively reviewed 70 patients who underwent emergency surgery for AAAD with coronary malperfusion, excluding those with cardiac tamponade on arrival, between 1997 and February 2024. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on transportation: direct transfer and referral. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 27%, with only 1 of 9 patients surviving with preoperative peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Mortality and morbidity did not significantly differ between groups. Univariate analysis identified left coronary artery involvement and preoperative hemodynamic instability as significant risk factors. Additionally, preoperative diagnostic-only coronary angiography (CAG) with unsuccessful reperfusion was a potential risk factor (P = 0.06). Regardless of transportation type, preoperative peripheral ECMO itself could not be a definitive solution in AAAD patients with coronary malperfusion. Also, patients who underwent preoperative CAG with unsuccessful reperfusion might be fatal, especially with suspected left coronary artery involvement."

    "abstract": "A healthy woman in her 20s presented to the emergency department (ED) after she endured a high-energy trauma during a dirt bike race. Physical examination showed no signs of thoracic or abdominal injury. Her pubic bone was painful at palpation, with a large amount of vaginal bleeding and a rupture of the vaginal back wall. Additional imaging with X-rays and extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma showed no fractures or free fluid in the abdomen, and the patient was then taken to the operating room for closure of the rupture. This patient became haemodynamically unstable during the operative procedure because of a transection of a side branch of the left internal iliac artery. Angiography with selective embolisation was performed, after which the bleeding stopped. We present a rare case of a high-pressure arterial bleed in the pelvis due to blunt trauma without osseous injuries. The learning point of this case is that prior to the operative procedure, a CT angiography of the abdomen should have been performed in the ED. Even though traumatic isolated injury to the internal iliac artery is a rare occurrence and the patient was initially haemodynamically stable, the intensity of the trauma and a large amount of vaginal bleeding warranted additional imaging."

    "title": "Heart in Focus: Advancing Pericardial Effusion Diagnosis With Point-of-Care Ultrasound.",
    "abstract": "Pericardial effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid within the pericardial sac, the double-layered membrane surrounding the heart. It can be caused by various medical conditions and may lead to serious complications if not diagnosed and managed promptly. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has emerged as a valuable tool in the clinical evaluation of pericardial effusions, offering real-time visualization and aiding in the assessment of its size, characteristics, and potential hemodynamic impact. This comprehensive revision explores the utility of POCUS in diagnosing and managing pericardial effusions. POCUS has gained prominence as a bedside diagnostic tool due to its immediacy, accuracy, and non-invasive nature. This study investigates how POCUS can address critical gaps in current diagnostic approaches, such as delays in diagnosis using traditional imaging modalities and challenges in resource-limited settings, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and clinical decision-making. A search was conducted on PubMed in August of 2023, using the keywords \"POCUS\" and \"pericardial\" as MeSH terms and reference mining. A total of 19 articles were included in this review. Characterization and quantification of pericardial effusion (PEF) using POCUS can provide clinicians with critical clues regarding the underlying etiology. This information, combined with other hemodynamic parameters, should guide subsequent management decisions. POCUS enables the identification of key sonographic findings, such as diastolic collapse of the right chambers, abnormal septal movement, and an engorged inferior vena cava (IVC), which together raise a high clinical suspicion of cardiac tamponade. Beyond its utility in identifying tamponade, POCUS plays a significant role in detecting subtle yet life-threatening conditions, such as aortic dissection, which may manifest as pericardial effusion due to hemopericardium. While POCUS is not definitive for diagnosing aortic dissection, indirect findings such as a pericardial effusion with hemodynamic compromise, coupled with high clinical suspicion, should prompt further imaging like CT angiography for confirmation. We propose an algorithmic approach: if cardiac tamponade is confirmed on POCUS, emergent pericardiocentesis is warranted. If ruled out, further investigations should be directed toward identifying the underlying cause of the PEF, including potentially ruling out aortic dissection to avoid missing a subtle but critical condition. POCUS has revolutionized the clinical evaluation of pericardial effusions, providing clinicians with a rapid and accurate bedside tool for diagnosis and management. Its ability to assess effusion size, identify cardiac tamponade, and guide pericardiocentesis procedures has proven invaluable in improving patient outcomes. Integrating POCUS into routine clinical practice enhances diagnostic accuracy and timely intervention, ensuring better care for patients with pericardial effusions. However, it is important to acknowledge its limitations. POCUS is highly operator-dependent, with diagnostic accuracy varying based on the clinician's experience and training. Additionally, the availability of ultrasound equipment and adequately trained personnel can be a barrier, particularly in resource-limited settings. Addressing these challenges is crucial to maximizing the utility of POCUS in clinical practice."

Ocular examination revealed multilevel ocular injury with severe bilateral corneal oedema. This was managed with topical steroids, mydriatics and antibiotic therapy. At 1-month follow-up, the left eye had persistent corneal oedema. Specular microscopy was performed which confirmed endothelial cell loss making the patient a candidate for a corneal endothelial graft. We observed blunt trauma from airbag deployment causing endothelial cell loss and subsequent corneal decompensation. Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the emergency department with facial trauma from airbag injury should be referred for comprehensive ophthalmological assessment and that the reviewing ophthalmologist should have endothelial cell loss in mind during examination."

They can be harmful to children in 2 ways. Upon ingestion, water beads absorb liquid and, because they can increase in volume by more than a hundredfold, intestinal obstruction can result. In addition, they are made of polymerized acrylamide monomer. Acrylamide monomer can be toxic at high levels. Here, we present a case of intestinal obstruction in the setting of water bead ingestion temporarily associated with signs of neurotoxicity. The patient presented to the emergency department at 13 months of age with vomiting, lethargy, weight loss over several weeks, insomnia, and facial dermatitis. Due to worsening clinical signs and imaging findings suggestive of intestinal obstruction, she underwent an exploratory laparotomy. A mass consisting of water beads was removed from the distal small intestine. After removal of the mass, the patient's facial dermatitis resolved; however, the patient's speech, gross and fine motor, sensory, and neurological functions continued to worsen. After reevaluation, a second surgical procedure led to removal of multiple fragments of water bead material from the patient's large intestine.

This retrospective study included 853 adult minor blunt trauma patients who underwent chest CT in the emergency department (ED) of Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center between 2018 and 2022. Clinically meaningful outcomes were defined as trauma-related interventions or hospital admissions. The NEXUS Chest CT DI criteria, along with three additional criteria, were analyzed using logistic regression to identify independent predictors for the primary outcome. These predictors formed a modified DI, and its performance was compared to the original NEXUS DI. Among 853 patients (median age 44.5 years, 64.2% male), 230 (27.0%) had trauma-related chest CT findings, and 64 (7.5%) experienced clinically meaningful outcomes. Independent predictors included abnormal chest X-ray (aOR 6.5, p < 0.001), chronic disease (aOR 5.2, p < 0.001), sternal tenderness (aOR 4.7, p = 0.007), rapid deceleration (aOR 3.7, p < 0.001), and chest wall tenderness (aOR 3.1, p < 0.001). The NEXUS DI achieved 92.1% sensitivity, reducing imaging by 41.3%, while the modified DI increased sensitivity to 98.4% with a 34.3% imaging reduction. The NEXUS Chest CT ALL DI significantly reduces unnecessary imaging while maintaining high diagnostic precision. A modified version enhances sensitivity, refining decision-making in emergency care. Integrating such decision tools, particularly in cases of minor trauma, is highly recommended to optimize resource use and improve patient outcomes."

Retrospective review of patients (> 18 years) with PAI, presenting to CMJAH trauma unit from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2022. Sixty-four patient records were analysed. Thirty (46.9%) had blunt trauma and thirty-four (53.1%) had penetrating trauma. Gunshot wounds (GSW) were the most common mechanism of injury (MOI). Blunt PAI had a 40% amputation rate and penetrating trauma, 33.3%. Forty-seven (73.4%) had a delay to surgery of > 6 h. The mean time to arrival at our emergency department was 478 min, and the mean time from arrival to surgery was 368 min (total delay of 838 min). The primary amputation rate was 28.6%, and 63.5% had successful limb salvage surgeries. The secondary amputation rate was 7.8%. Compared to international literature, our rate of primary amputation is high (10% vs. 28.8%) and prolonged ischaemia is the likely cause. Only 17 (26.6%) patients presented before 6 h. Of the 45 patients that had an attempt at revascularisation, 7.8% had a secondary amputation. Thus, despite prolonged ischaemia, revascularisation should be attempted in patients with at least two viable compartments on fasciotomy. The MESS and POPSAVEIT scoring systems should not be relied on in patients with delayed presentations. Strengthening referral triage for suspected PAI to Level 1 Trauma centres directly will decrease the delays and likely improve the outcomes."

Successful bailout is typically defined as the disappearance of contrast extravasation after a haemostatic intervention. We report a case of recurrent cardiac tamponade in the subacute phase, wherein haemostasis appeared to have been achieved on angiography following the implantation of a covered stent during the index procedure.A 61-year-old male underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention with a rotator placed in the middle of the left ascending artery. Coronary perforation occurred during rotablation and was treated with a covered stent. However, cardiac tamponade recurred on postoperative day 30. Emergency coronary angiography was performed, and no contrast extravasation was observed on angiography. However, intravascular ultrasonography was performed to clarify the cause of the recurrent pericardial effusion and revealed that the distal edge of the covered stent was not fully attached to the vessel wall due to protruding calcification. Another covered stent was placed distal to the previous stent for sealing the malapposed site. There was no recurrence of pericardial effusion.Malapposition of covered stents may not be detected by angiography alone, potentially resulting in recurrent bleeding.

    "title": "Determinants of mortality after massive transfusion - A prospective study.",
    "abstract": "Massive hemorrhage calls for massive transfusions (MTs) to maintain adequate hemostasis. Massive transfusion protocols (MTPs) are the appropriate treatment strategy for such patients replacing conventional use of crystalloids. These help in standardizing and optimizing the delivery of blood components in a well-balanced ratio. The aim of the study is to propose an ideal ratio of blood components for MTP after assessing relationship between ratios of blood components transfused and mortality. MT was defined as receiving >4 packed red blood cell (PRBC) units within 1 h with the anticipation of continued need for blood products. All MT patients above 13 years of age regardless of cause of bleed were included in the study from December 2015 to October 2017 accounting for a total of 61 patients. Subgroup categorization of study population was done, and physician-driven ratios of the blood components were calculated for each case. The ratios were grouped as high (>1), equal (=1), and low (<1) ratios of fresh frozen plasma (FFP):PRBC and platelet: PRBC, and the relationship of these ratios to the clinical outcome in terms of mortality was examined. Sixty-one patients underwent MT of which the overall hospital mortality rate was 8.1% with 100% mortality among patients with penetrating trauma followed by 25% with gastrointestinal bleed. Emergency admission was an independent risk factor for mortality. Hypotension before the initiation of MT was detrimental for survival. Efficient communication existed between the treating physicians and transfusion. Majority of survivors received equal ratios of FFP: PRBC and platelet: PRBC, and all nonsurvivors received low ratios of FFP: PRBC. Analysis was statistically indicating better survival with 1:1:1 ratio of PRBC: FFP: platelet. The need of the hour is to establish an institutional MTP and ensure compliance with the same. A prospective randomized controlled trial needs to be done to overcome the limitations and confounders of the present study and establish a universal protocol."

    "title": "Internal Hernia: An Uncommon and Often-Missed Differential Diagnosis of Abdominal Pain.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal pain is a common presenting symptom among patients visiting the hospital. A wide range of differential diagnoses are associated with this presentation, some of which are more uncommon than others, and require a higher degree of clinical suspicion and radiological excellence to diagnose. Although clinicians rely on physical assessment, examining a patient who is agitated and non-cooperative sometimes limits the physical exam findings, making these diagnoses even more challenging. We present a case of a middle-aged male patient who had acute abdominal pain in the setting of polysubstance abuse as confirmed by a drug screen. His initial imaging was unremarkable for a cause and the patient was intubated. After intubation and sedation, his physical examination was benign. He was extubated the next day and complained of worsening abdominal pain. His physical exam then was concerning for an acute abdomen and upon review of the initial imaging, a missed diagnosis of internal hernia was established. The patient subsequently underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and a large section of the bowel was resected. This case highlights the importance of considering alternate diagnoses for common presentations and paying careful attention to classic radiology findings in these situations."

    "abstract": "Thoracostomies, and subsequent placements of chest tubes (CTs), are a standard procedure in several domains of medicine. In emergency medicine, thoracostomies are indicated to release a relevant hemothorax or pneumothorax, particularly a life-threatening tension pneumothorax. In many cases, an initial finger-assisted thoracostomy is followed by placement of a CT to ensure continuous decompression of blood and air. CTs prevent the reoccurrence of a hemothorax or pneumothorax, which may otherwise develop by closure of the initial thoracostomy incision. CTs are commercial, purpose-made products; however, in certain settings, those may not be readily available. Triggered by own experience, we review the use of endotracheal tubes as back-up alternatives to commercial CTs.On a structural base, commercial CTs may not be available in economically challenged regions. Furthermore, in settings with restricted capacity for equipment weight and volume, for example, in mountain rescue backpacks, it might not be feasible to carry CTs, even if the care provider is adequately trained. Finally, care providers may run out of stock of commercial CTs, for example, in civil mass casualty ('MASCAL') scenarios, natural disasters or on the battlefield with difficult resupply. Literature on this topic is very limited. In this manuscript, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of standard endotracheal tubes as alternatives in settings, where commercial CTs are not readily available.Although certainly not advocated as standard, the use of endotracheal tubes as CTs may be a suitable alternative or back-up solution in settings where commercial CTs are not readily available. We assume that this technique will be particularly of interest in settings with a high risk for thoracic injuries and limited availability of commercial CTs, for example, in military conflicts. Given the virtual absence of scientific data, more research on risks, benefits and patient outcome is required."

    "abstract": "Catheter ablation procedure for symptomatic atrial fibrillation is an established treatment. Cardiac tamponade is one of the several complications associated with atrial fibrillation ablation. We present the case of a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypotension on midodrine, atrial fibrillation status post-ablation a week prior, and a cerebrovascular accident who presented to the emergency department with complaints of weakness, nausea, vomiting, confusion and some syncopal episodes for the past few days. He denied chest pain, dyspnea, and a history of alcohol use. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated liver enzymes and troponins. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray showed low lung volumes with a left retrocardiac opacity and cardiomegaly. Given the patient's hypotension requiring vasopressor support, elevated troponins, and a recent cardiac procedure, an echocardiogram was done, and it revealed a large posterior pericardial effusion adjacent to the left ventricle. Tamponade was suspected and the patient was taken for an emergent pericardial window. Intraoperatively, a perforation of the right ventricle was found with a large area of surrounding necrotic and ischemic tissue. There was a significant hemorrhage with the opening of the pericardium, which could not be controlled due to the large area of non-viable cardiac tissue. The patient went into cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity. Open cardiac massage was performed but the return of spontaneous circulation could not be achieved and the patient was declared deceased. Pericardial effusion with tamponade is the complication of cardiac ablation associated with the highest mortality. An echocardiogram is a fast and reliable way to confirm the diagnosis of a tamponade. Delayed cardiac tamponade should always remain a differential diagnosis when a patient has recently undergone an ablation procedure given the potential fatality."

    "title": "Apixaban removal during emergency surgery for type A acute aortic dissection: a prospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) has a high mortality, and acute aortic repair is the only curative treatment. In patients treated with factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors, the risk of severe disease-related complications such as cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic shock must be balanced against the potential for severe perioperative bleeding. The aim was to study intraoperative changes in plasma levels of the FXa inhibitor apixaban when using hemoadsorption during acute thoracic aortic repair. This is a single-center prospective cohort study. Eight apixaban-treated patients presenting with ATAAD underwent acute thoracic aortic repair with intraoperative hemoadsorption with CytoSorb. Apixaban concentrations were measured at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and after 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min of CPB, at CPB weaning, 30 min after CPB weaning and 24 h postoperatively, using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). After 30 min of CPB with hemoadsorption, mean apixaban concentration (±SD) was reduced by 59% from 108 (±69) µg/l to 44 (±20) µg/l (P=0.009). There was a further reduction to 37 (±17) µg/l at CPB weaning (P=0.008). Apixaban concentration displayed an increase to 56 (±29) µg/l 24 h postoperatively (P=0.01). In-hospital mortality was 25%. The mean 24H chest tube drainage volume was 621 (±136) ml. Intraoperative hemoadsorption lowers apixaban levels in patients undergoing emergency surgery for ATAAD. Further research is needed to determine its impact on perioperative bleeding complications and mortality."

    "abstract": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a common surgical treatment for morbid obesity, but rare complications involving the excluded gastric remnant can pose significant challenges. A 65-year-old female with a history of RYGB presented with sudden onset of left upper quadrant abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and loss of appetite. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis. An initial CT scan showed significant distention of the excluded stomach, suggesting possible obstruction. While preparing for percutaneous decompression, her abdominal pain worsened acutely. A repeat CT scan demonstrated decompression of the excluded stomach and new free fluid in the abdomen, indicating a perforation. Emergent exploratory laparotomy uncovered a large necrotic perforation in the excluded gastric remnant and extensive adhesions from prior surgeries. A partial gastrectomy and antrectomy were performed to remove the perforated tissue. Pathological examination revealed ulcerated gastric mucosa with acute and chronic inflammation, reactive gastropathy, and no evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection or malignancy. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well with supportive care and was discharged home. Diagnosing complications in the excluded stomach after RYGB is challenging due to altered anatomy and nonspecific symptoms. Maintaining a high index of suspicion is essential when evaluating post-RYGB patients with unexplained abdominal pain. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are critical for favorable outcomes in these patients."

    "abstract": "Penetrating cardiac trauma is an entity with high pre and intrahospital mortality due to complications such as cardiac tamponade and massive hemothorax. A ventricular septal defect (VSD) occurs in 1-5% of cases and can present early or late. The management strategy for VSD resulting from penetrating cardiac trauma is uncertain. A 19-year-old man was admitted in cardiorespiratory arrest after a precordial stab wound. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated achieving return of spontaneous circulation. eFAST evaluation revealed cardiac tamponade, he was taken to emergency left thoracotomy finding a perforation of the free wall of the left ventricle and a tear of the upper lobe of the left lung that were sutured. The patient was discharged and six days later was readmitted with fever and dyspnea. During treatment for a surgical site infection a new-onset pansystolic murmur was found: A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a 13-mm VSD with left-to-right shunt. A multidisciplinary team recommended percutaneous closure of the defect which was successfully performed without complications. Traumatic VSD is a rare complication of penetrating cardiac trauma. A thorough clinical and echocardiographic evaluation is essential for its diagnosis and characterization. Symptomatic septal defects, those 10 mm or larger, with Qp: Qs greater than 1.5, or causing complications such as pulmonary hypertension or valvular involvement, are usually closed to prevent progression of heart failure. Management of traumatic VSD has traditionally been surgical. However, a percutaneous intervention is a viable alternative in selected stable patients. Unlike ischemic VSD, early intervention after patient stabilization generally yields favorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition resulting from fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, leading to decreased cardiac output and shock. Various etiologies can cause cardiac tamponade, including liver cirrhosis, which may be induced by autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic inflammatory liver disease characterized by interface hepatitis, elevated transaminase levels, autoantibodies, and increased immunoglobulin G levels. This case report details a 60-year-old male with autoimmune hepatitis-induced cirrhosis presenting with severe pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, emphasizing the interplay between liver and cardiac pathologies. A 60-year-old Persian man presented with progressive dyspnea, chest pain, and significant weight gain due to fluid retention. Physical examination revealed pallor, jaundice, elevated jugular venous pressure, muffled heart sounds, and tachycardia. Laboratory tests indicated severe hepatic and renal dysfunction, with elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and blood urea nitrogen. Imaging studies, including electrocardiogram, computed tomography angiography, and transthoracic echocardiogram, confirmed large pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, aspirating 500 mL of serosanguinous fluid. Post-procedural management included continuous monitoring, repeat echocardiography, and a comprehensive pharmacological regimen addressing fluid overload, autoimmune hepatitis, and cardiac function. This case underscores the importance of timely diagnosis and management of cardiac tamponade, particularly in patients with concomitant conditions like autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis. Multidisciplinary management involving hepatologists, cardiologists, and critical care specialists is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Early recognition and treatment contribute substantially to the prevention of recurrence and better long-term management of underlying conditions."

    "abstract": "Heterotopic pregnancy is defined as the concurrent presence of both an intrauterine pregnancy and an extrauterine (typically ectopic) pregnancy. This report presents the case of a 36-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain. A comprehensive evaluation, including transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound imaging, revealed a heterotopic pregnancy at an estimated gestational age of six weeks and two days. The ultrasound examination confirmed an intrauterine pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity and a visible fetal pole, as well as a complex vascular lesion in the left adnexal region. Consequently, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, including a left salpingectomy, to remove the ruptured left tubal ectopic pregnancy. The ectopic pregnancy was successfully excised, and the intrauterine embryo was preserved. Following this surgical intervention, the pregnancy progressed without complications, culminating in the delivery of a healthy infant at 39 weeks of gestation. With timely and appropriate treatment, a heterotopic pregnancy can result in a successful live birth, yielding favorable outcomes for both mother and child. This case underscores the necessity of considering heterotopic pregnancy even in the absence of risk factors and highlights the importance of multidisciplinary management to achieve optimal outcomes."

This rare mechanism of injury is most commonly reported to affect the non-dominant hand, occurring due to the malfunction or misuse of industrial paint machines, causing a piercing soft tissue injury with high-pressure fluid. The unique challenges faced in managing penetrating injuries to the neck are due to the density of vital visceral structures in the region, including major blood vessels and the upper aerodigestive tract. Whilst there is one documented case of a water injection injury, there are no published reports involving paint injection injuries to the neck at the time of writing this report. As such, we present this unique case to highlight important learning points and the challenges faced in our experience of managing a penetrating paint injury of the neck at our major trauma centre."

The true incidence of intracranial carotid injury is unknown but can be estimated at less than one in 1000 trauma-related inpatient admissions in America. Operatively managed penetrating carotid trauma has a mortality rate approaching 20%, and the selection of the appropriate operative approach is not straightforward. We present a case of penetrating carotid trauma successfully managed via combined approach by neurosurgery and otolaryngology teams. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman fell into a honeysuckle bush. She presented with a branch embedded in the left cheek and blindness of the right eye. Further workup revealed the branch had penetrated the maxillary bone, pierced the right optic nerve, and lodged near the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery. She underwent emergent operative intervention via right pterional craniotomy with microsurgery and endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery with repair of the skull base. The foreign body was removed and the traumatic carotid laceration was repaired. The patient recovered successfully and was discharged on postoperative day 14. CONCLUSIONS The management of facially penetrating foreign bodies begins with assessment for neurologic deficits and vascular injury. We recommend leaving such objects in place and not removing them until definitive imaging is obtained. We present an interesting case of penetrating trauma to the intracranial carotid artery in which a retained foreign body was removed with satisfactory patient outcome using a combined endoscopic and open surgical approach."

Right atrium injuries pose significant risks, including rapid blood loss, cardiac tamponade, hemodynamic instability, and, subsequently, potential death. We report the case of a 24-year-old male patient with stab wounds leading to a right-sided chest penetration three hours prior to presentation. The patient exhibited hypotension, tachycardia, and mild respiratory distress upon arrival. The patient had a 1.5x3 cm penetrating injury in the right fourth intercostal space and another 1x3 cm incision in the fifth intercostal region. A right chest tube was inserted, draining 500 milliliters of hemothorax, and continued to increase without improvement in the patient's condition. The patient was quickly taken to the operating room after initial resuscitation with fluids and blood transfusion, where the abdominal diagnostic laparoscopy was negative, but a thoracotomy revealed hemopericardium and a 2x3 cm right atrial rupture. A tangential Satinsky clamp and a double-layered 5-0 double-arm polypropylene suture were utilized to achieve hemostasis during repair. The patient was extubated successfully on the first postoperative day and discharged in stable condition on the ninth day. This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis and surgical management in cases of penetrating cardiac trauma. Even in resource-limited settings, managing right atrial rupture can be effectively achieved through rapid resuscitation, proper imaging, and skilled surgical techniques."

Most commonly observed in postmenopausal women with a history of pelvic surgery or trauma, it necessitates prompt surgical intervention. We report a unique case of transvaginal evisceration in a 67-year-old postmenopausal female with rectovaginal prolapse following minor trauma. The patient presented with sudden pelvic pain and a mass protruding through the vaginal canal after lifting a heavy object. Examination revealed a loop of small bowel through the vaginal opening. She was hemodynamically stable, and initial management included bowel reduction and intravenous fluid administration. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed a full-thickness defect in the posterior vaginal wall with approximately 40 cm of viable small bowel eviscerated. The defect was repaired with absorbable sutures, and the patient recovered uneventfully, being discharged on postoperative day five. This case underscores the importance of considering transvaginal evisceration in postmenopausal women with rectovaginal prolapse, even after minor trauma, to enable timely intervention and prevent severe complications."

    "abstract": "Anticoagulants increase the risk of cardiac tamponade in patients with pericardial effusion (PE). Therefore, inappropriate administration of them in the presence of PE can lead to a catastrophic outcome. This study presents a patient with a provisional misdiagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). An 83-year-old Iranian female was transferred to the emergency department of a tertiary cardiology hospital complaining of neck swelling concomitant with chest pain and dyspnea. The patient had been diagnosed with jugular vein thrombosis in another local center, and since the chief complaint was neck swelling, she underwent Doppler sonography, and the diagnosis was confirmed. Subsequently, the treatment with unfractionated heparin was started. After 5 h, considering the worsening of symptoms with the suspicious diagnosis of COVID-19 based on her symptoms and laboratory data, a chest computed tomography scan was requested, which showed a massive PE. Subsequently, transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room and underwent pericardiotomy. The post-surgery period was uneventful, and she was discharged 5 days later. Patients with viral infections, specifically COVID-19, are at risk of undiagnosed severe pericardial effusions. Venous stasis in the jugular veins due to PE can mimic jugular vein thromboembolism, causing a wrong diagnosis. Since treating thrombosis can exacerbate tamponade to hemodynamic instability and collapse, sufficient investigation before starting anticoagulants is necessary. Distinguishing VTE from PE is not always straightforward. Therefore, it is important to ensure physicians have reached an appropriate level of certainty about their diagnosis by performing precise diagnostics before using anticoagulants. Mismanagement with anti-thrombotics can result in catastrophic consequences. Therefore, taking an accurate history, performing a precise physical examination, and using rapid and available diagnostic modalities can avoid delays in definitive management."

    "abstract": "Background Wound dehiscence (WD) is a major postoperative complication following abdominal surgeries, particularly exploratory laparotomy. Identifying preoperative risk factors and using predictive tools, such as the Rotterdam Risk Index (RRI), are crucial for early intervention and improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors associated with WD and assess the predictive accuracy of the RRI in a cohort of patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. Methods This retrospective observational study included 151 patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy at a tertiary care hospital. Demographic details, comorbidities, surgical factors, and postoperative complications were recorded. The RRI was calculated preoperatively for each patient. WD was diagnosed based on clinical signs and confirmed through physical examination. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software to determine the associations between various risk factors and the occurrence of WD. Results The study identified several factors significantly associated with WD, including male gender, emergency surgery, low serum albumin levels (<3.5 g/dL), anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL), and wound contamination. Male patients had a higher risk of WD, with odds of 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-3.3, p = 0.021). Emergency surgery was associated with a higher incidence of WD (odds ratio (OR): 4.1, 95% CI: 1.5-10.4, p = 0.017). The RRI showed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (90.2%) for predicting WD preoperatively, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.986. Postoperatively, 22 patients with WD were treated with resuturing, while two required reoperation due to anastomotic leaks. Conclusion The RRI demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy for identifying patients at high risk of WD before surgery. Early identification of risk factors, such as low serum albumin, anemia, and emergency surgeries, enables personalized perioperative management strategies, including nutritional optimization and careful intraoperative monitoring, which can significantly reduce the risk of WD. These findings emphasize the clinical utility of the RRI in guiding surgical decision-making and improving patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Arterio-enteric fistula is one of the extremely rare complications of penetrating trauma. A 27-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a gunshot to the right buttock. Initial assessments revealed a left femoral shaft fracture, the right buttock as the bullet inlet and the medial portion of the left thigh as an outlet, with no other significant findings. He underwent external fixation for the left femoral fracture. On the seventh day of admission, the patient experienced two episodes of massive melena and hypovolemic shock. The patient underwent an upper endoscopy without any remarkable findings. Also, we performed an emergent laparotomy to find the source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB); however, no evidence of upper GIB was found. Then, the patient underwent CT angiography, which subsequently identified a deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. Also, we performed a colonoscopy to investigate the source of GIB, revealing an orifice on the rectal wall. The patient underwent open surgery for a pseudoaneurysm. During surgery, a tract from the pseudoaneurysm of the deep femoral artery to the rectum was discovered, leading to the ligation of the deep femoral artery branch. After recovery from the operation and completion of the orthopedic treatment, the patient was discharged in an appropriate condition. Traumatic arterio-enteric fistulas can present with fatal gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring crucial investigations and proper imaging evaluations. In case of new-onset massive melena during hospitalization, upper GIB should always be considered. However, in penetrating trauma patients, repeating CT angiography should be considered."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Iliac vein injuries usually require surgical intervention due to their high mortality rates. Although conservative management may be applicable in some cases of blunt trauma, the suitability of this approach for treating penetrating injuries remains underexplored. CASE REPORT A 51-year-old man sustained a common iliac vein injury following rectal impalement in a collapsing chair. After initial resuscitation, he underwent an emergency laparotomy, which revealed no ascites or blood in the abdominal cavity. Given the stability of the hematoma, the decision was made to avoid incising the retroperitoneum, thus maintaining the tamponade effect. A double-barrel stoma was fashioned in the transverse colon to address the rectal damage. The patient's postoperative course was initially uneventful, with no confirmed hematoma expansion on the second computed tomography scan. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 11 following a consistent decrease in D-dimer levels. However, 4 days after discharge, he presented with edema in the right lower extremity. He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which were managed with intravenous heparin and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). The patient continued follow-up visits without further complications. CONCLUSIONS This report presents the first documented case of conservative management of an iliac vein injury resulting from an impalement wound. It highlights the potential of a nonsurgical approach in stable patients and underscores the importance of considering postoperative prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT and PE."

PGTL can present with a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, but patients only rarely present with perforation. We report the case of a 68-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a history of chronic abdominal pain that was localized to the epigastrium over the last few days. Computed tomography (CT) identified pneumoperitoneum. Exploratory laparotomy revealed gastric antral perforation. Histologically, perforation margins were diffusely involved by large pleomorphic lymphoma cells with multilobated nuclei and focal anaplastic morphology. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were positive for CD3 (partial), CD4, CD5, CD7, CD43, CD45, BCL2, and BCL6 (dim). The neoplastic cells were negative for CD1a, CD2, CD8, CD10, CD20, CD21, CD23, CD30, CD34, CD56, ALK1, TdT, lysozyme, CXCL13, ICOS, PD1, myeloperoxidase (MPO), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), and keratin. Ki-67 showed a proliferation rate of 80-90%, and in situ hybridization was negative for Epstein-Barr virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the T-cell receptors gamma (TRG) and beta (TRB) demonstrated monoclonal peaks. Quantitative PCR for HTLV-1 integration was negative. The diagnosis was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, stage IV, consistent with primary gastric lymphoma. To better understand this neoplasm, we performed a comprehensive English language literature review, retrieving clinical, pathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular data when available, and discussed the most relevant features for diagnosis and classification using the 5th edition of World Health Organization, as well as prognostic features and outcomes of this lymphoma."

    "abstract": "The patient an 85-year-old female resided in a care facility where she maintained an independent daily activity level. She was discovered hunched over a table in her room, displaying reduced responsiveness and prompting an emergency call. Initially, her blood pressure was within 60 mmHg, and she was transported by ambulance to our hospital. Further examination revealed acute Stanford type A aortic dissection accompanied by signs of cardiac tamponade, necessitating urgent surgery. The operation was performed under general anesthesia and tracheal intubation. After exposing the femoral vessels through an incision in the right groin, cannulation was achieved for cardiopulmonary bypass. Subsequently, a median sternotomy was performed and the pericardium was opened. Blood within the pericardial cavity was carefully exposed and blood pressure was monitored. The pericardial cavity contained a large number of dark red hematomas. A left ventricular vent was inserted and cooling was initiated. The circulatory arrest was achieved at a rectal temperature of 28°C, accompanied by antegrade cerebral perfusion and selective antegrade myocardial protection to facilitate cardiac arrest. The entry tear was located on the dorsal aspect of the ascending aorta. Additionally, the ascending aorta was trimmed proximal to the brachiocephalic artery and a 26-mm Gelweave graft was anastomosed. Circulation was subsequently resumed, and rewarming commenced. The proximal dissection was extended to the non-coronary cusp, where BioGlue was applied to bond the intima and adventitia, followed by a partial adventitial inversion. The proximal anastomosis was then completed. The total operation duration was 366 min. The patient was extubated, and oral intake was initiated the following day. However, postoperative delirium persisted, and the patient developed a cerebral infarction triggered by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Her daily activities declined, and she experienced complications including pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which responded to antibiotic therapy. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 49."

    "title": "Emergency centre thoracotomy for penetrating trauma: Insights from 2 South African district-level emergency centres.",
    "abstract": "Trauma is a major contributor to global disease burden, disproportionally affecting low- and middle-income countries, especially in the African Region. Emergency centre thoracotomy (ECT) is a potentially life-saving procedure for a sub-group of trauma patients in extremis. Most literature regarding ECT originated in high-income countries. This study aimed to describe patient, procedure and outcome characteristics of ECTs performed at two facilities in a resource-limited setting in South Africa. A retrospective chart review was performed at two district-level facilities in Cape Town from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2021. All patients who underwent post-trauma thoracotomy in the emergency centre (EC) were eligible for inclusion. Cases were excluded if patients did not undergo thoracotomy in the EC, or if medical records were missing. Patients were identified using an electronic EC attendance register, and theatre records, which were screened using documented diagnoses and dispositions. Clinical notes were interrogated for information regarding patient demographics, mechanism of injury, clinical presentation, procedural characteristics (such as level of clinician, injury found, use of ultrasound). Outcomes measured were survival to specified endpoints, and neurological or functional outcomes. Over 4 years, 67 ECTs were performed (50 stabs, 17 gunshots). No ECTs were performed for blunt trauma. Most patients were male, with a median age of 25 years (IQR 21-33). More than two-thirds of patients presented with their own transport, and more than 80 % presented with signs of life. Most ECTs were performed by non-specialists. Survival to hospital discharge was 24 % (32 % for stabs, 0 % for gunshots). Neurological outcome was difficult to analyse, however seemed to be good in all but one survivor. The performance of ECT in this resource-limited district-level setting, followed by stabilisation and transfer of patients to tertiary hospitals seems to result in comparable or better survival rates than reported in international literature. Further research is needed to better describe the performance and outcomes of EC thoracotomies in a resource-limited setting. This study setting, with high incidence of trauma and ECT performed, provides an excellent opportunity for further research. Prospective studies may demonstrate correlations between specific patient and procedural characteristics and outcomes and may guide the development of local guidelines."

    "abstract": "Brown-Séquard syndrome (BSS) is a rare neurological condition characterized by injury to one-half of the spinal cord. In the context of trauma, BSS is typically seen with penetrating injuries. Here, the authors present the unique case of a patient presenting with BSS after blunt trauma. A 70-year-old male with a history of right cervical hemilaminectomies from C4 to C6 and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) presented after a motor vehicle collision. He had left-sided weakness (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] grade C with a motor score of 45 and a neurological level of C4), left-sided sensory loss, and right-sided loss of sensation to painful stimulation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant spinal cord compression from C2 to C6, with intramedullary signal from C2 to C5. The patient underwent urgent C2-6 laminectomies with C2-5 instrumented fusion. Intraoperative ultrasound confirmed complete decompression as well as visualized a hyperechoic signal, particularly in the left C3-4 hemicord, evident of spinal cord injury. Postoperatively, his ASIA motor score improved to 56 at the 6-week follow-up. This case highlights a unique scenario in which prior decompressive surgeries could have provided a protective effect on the spinal cord at the levels with concomitant OPLL and hemilaminectomies, potentially preventing complete tetraplegia. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE24637."

    "abstract": "A 63-year-old female presented to our emergency department with altered mental status and hypotension. She was transferred from the outpatient interventional radiology suite after becoming unresponsive during the removal of an inferior vena cava filter. The patient arrived somnolent with no other history available. Her physical exam was unremarkable. We used point-of-care-ultrasound to perform a rapid ultrasound for shock and hypotension (RUSH) exam. A large pericardial effusion along with signs of cardiac tamponade were identified. The cardiothoracic surgery team was notified, and the patient was taken to the operating room where pericardial blood and a large hematoma were evacuated. She recovered uneventfully and was discharged one week later. The above case describes a very unstable patient whose diagnosis was obtained using the RUSH exam. History and physical did not point to a clear etiology. Options were very limited. She was too unstable to go for computed tomography, and other tests such as electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and lab work would have been non-diagnostic. It was only after the cardiac view of the RUSH exam was obtained that a pericardial effusion and developing tamponade were identified, facilitating timely management. The RUSH exam, like the extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma, is used to help determine pathologies that need immediate intervention. Incorporation in the evaluation of critically ill patients reduces the time to diagnosis. Our case is a unique example of how point-of-care ultrasound can be used to urgently identify a life-threatening pathology."

    "abstract": "Trichobezor is a mass of accumulated ingested hair in the gastric lumen. Rapunzel syndrome is an extension of these bezoars beyond the pylorus. The formation of trichobezoar is invariably linked to trichotillomania and trichophagia. Convergence of trichotillomania and trichophagia resulting in the formation of massive trichobezoar and causing acute intestinal obstruction is a rare clinical manifestation. This case report aims to shed light on diagnostic intricacies and prompt management of such exceptional cases. This case report features a 13-year-old girl who presented to the surgical emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric fullness for 5-6 months. She also described tufts of hair in vomitus and stools for the past few weeks. Due to these symptoms, she started experiencing significant weight loss, pallor, and pedal edema. Her Investigations revealed a large trichobezoar causing gastrointestinal obstruction and she was managed with exploratory laparotomy and gastrotomy followed by multidisciplinary care. Trichobezoar develops secondary to trichotillomania and trichophagia. These disorders are deeply rooted in psychosocial stressors. This unique presentation highlights the need for awareness regarding such rare causes of intestinal obstruction. Psychosocial stressors, trichotillomania, and trichophagia often go unnoticed in teenagers resulting in drastic consequences. A multidisciplinary approach is required to diagnose and manage gastrointestinal obstruction secondary to Rapunzel Syndrome."

    "abstract": "Acutely injured trauma patients may develop shock from several potential mechanisms, including hypovolemic shock from hemorrhage, neurogenic shock from traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury, obstructive shock from tension pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade, or a mix of several of these mechanisms. Regardless of the cause, restoration of adequate perfusion is of critical importance to reduce the morbidity and mortality of trauma patients with shock. Multiple interventions including hemorrhage control, volume resuscitation with intravenous fluids or blood products, and pleural decompression procedures are used to address some of these issues and are discussed elsewhere in the trauma compendium. The prehospital use of vasopressors to augment organ perfusion pressures seems theoretically appealing for settings where trauma patients have hemorrhagic shock that is refractory to volume resuscitation strategies alone, where blood products are not available, in cases of hypoperfusion caused by neurogenic shock, or to address mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals in severe spinal cord injury. The National Association of Emergency Medical Services Physicians (NAEMSP) reviewed the available evidence surrounding the prehospital use of vasopressors in shock related to trauma to develop the following recommendations as supported by the evidence summarized in the subsequent resource document. Current evidence does not support the routine use of vasopressors by EMS clinicians for traumatic hemorrhagic shock and suggests the possibility of harm.Current evidence does not address the use of vasopressors by EMS clinicians in the treatment of patients with severe spinal cord injury presenting with neurogenic shock or to achieve specific mean arterial pressure goals in spine injured patients in the prehospital setting.Prehospital hypotension has been shown to be harmful to patients with TBI; however, there is currently no evidence to support or refute the use of vasopressors by EMS clinicians in the setting of TBI."

    "abstract": "Studies on emergency transarterial embolization (TAE) of renal arterial injuries are rare. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate clinical outcomes after emergency transarterial renal embolization. Between January 1st, 2013 and January 1st, 2024, all consecutive patients treated for renal arterial injuries by TAE in emergency settings were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic, biological and angiographic data were recorded. The inclusion criteria were all patients ≥ 18-years-old treated by emergency TAE for renal vascular injury. Clinical success was defined as the resolution of bleeding signs without the need for repeat TAE, surgery, death related to massive blood loss during this period, without functional impairment (> 50% of parenchyma volume or onset of chronic kidney disease) following TAE. During the inclusion period, 79 procedures were performed. The median age was 60[39-73] years old. On preoperative CT, ≥ 1 pseudoaneurysm was detected in 36(45.6%) patients, and active bleeding in 47(65.8%) patients. The preoperative median haemoglobin rate was 8.9[7.6-11] g/dl, and 37(46.8%) patients required red blood cell transfusions. The main aetiologies of arterial injury were blunt trauma (n = 19) and renal biopsy (n = 17). No severe adverse events were reported. Clinical success was reported in 74(93.7%) of the procedures. Three (3.8%) repeat embolizations were required, and were clinically successful. During the median follow-up of 7[1.5-35.5] months, 9(11.4%) patients died, of which 5(6.3%) occurred within 30 days. The present study reports high clinical success, low complications and low rebleeding rates of emergency renal TAE."

    "title": "Traumatic Tension Pneumothorax: A Tale of Two Pathologies.",
    "abstract": "Pneumothorax resulting from injury is a common phenomenon in both civilian and military trauma. A pneumothorax or simple pneumothorax is defined as air in the pleural space. A tension pneumothorax can evolve from a simple pneumothorax if there is a continued air leak from the lung without mechanism for egress. This occurs due to an expanding air volume and pressure in the pleural space. The tension pneumothorax results in obstructive shock that may be a life-threatening emergency. All types of pneumothorax can occur in patients who are non-positive pressure ventilated as well as those receiving positive pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation changes the dynamics of pneumothoraces in that it can exacerbate an air leak, resulting in a simple pneumothorax evolving into a tension pneumothorax. The pathophysiology and clinical presentation of these traumatic conditions represent two differing sub-pathologies, and, although they share the same underlying physiological process in the opinion of the authors, a different approach should be adopted when considering treatment. The objective of this manuscript is to discuss the etiology, incidence, and clinical significance of simple and tension pneumothoraces. This paper will propose a uniform description of pathophysiology and diagnostic elements as well as treatment strategies. The intent is to provide a standardization of the nomenclature as well as an understanding of the physiology and clinical significance of the spectrum of pneumothoraces. Finally, we conclude with the author groups 16-point position statement on traumatic tension pneumothorax, its definition and management. The main author position is: - In spontaneously breathing pneumothorax, because of the risk of harm, suspected low incidence, high rate of misdiagnosis, and low rate of procedural success, a conservative approach is advised. - In positive pressure ventilated tension pneumothorax, the incidence is greater and the time to severe physiological impact shorter; thus a more aggressive approach is advised."

    "abstract": "As a rare complication of penetrating chest trauma, one can occasionally find foreign bodies inside the pericardium. Even rarer is finding an intact bullet inside the pericardial cavity following the gunshot injury. A 17-year-old male presented to the emergency department as a Level 1 trauma for multiple gunshot wounds. Upon arrival, the patient was tachycardic but normotensive. Physical exam was notable for several penetrating wounds to the chest and right clavicle. The initial chest X-ray demonstrated a metallic foreign body consistent with a bullet overlying the cardiac silhouette. Approximately 24 h into the hospital course, ST-segment elevation was noted on telemetry. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads, consistent with acute pericarditis. Over the following several hours, the patient gradually developed tamponade physiology, prompting a more emergent median sternotomy. Although penetrating cardiac injury carries a high mortality rate, management of these patients and complications that may arise during their hospital course are rarely explained. The diagnosis of projectile chest trauma starts with history and physical examination. The primary diagnostic modalities are the X-ray, computed tomography scan of the chest, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Management of a patient with cardiac gunshot depends largely on haemodynamic status. As in our case, a patient with haemodynamic instability is managed with emergency exploration and removal of the foreign body."

    "abstract": "Blunt esophageal injury is an exceptionally rare condition, with complete esophageal avulsion being almost unprecedented in adults. This case study details the clinical presentation, surgical management, and postoperative course of a 50-year-old male who sustained a complete esophageal avulsion following blunt abdominal trauma. The patient presented with increasing abdominal pain two hours after falling while stepping up onto a high truck step, striking his upper abdomen on the step. CT imaging revealed pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum. Emergent exploratory laparotomy and thoracotomy uncovered a complete avulsion of the esophagus from the gastroesophageal junction. The surgical repair involved resection of the damaged esophagus and gastric cardia, an esophagogastric anastomosis using a 25 mm EEA stapler, and the creation of an omental pedicle flap. Postoperative management included antibiotic prophylaxis and intensive care monitoring. Blunt traumatic esophageal injuries, although rare, pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to their potential for severe complications such as mediastinitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure. Prompt recognition of the injury through imaging and clinical assessment is essential for initiating timely surgical intervention. The surgical approach must be meticulously planned to address the complexity of the injury, often requiring a combination of thoracic and abdominal procedures. Additionally, the role of a multidisciplinary team, including surgeons, intensivists, and gastroenterologists, is crucial in managing both the immediate and long-term aspects of patient care. This case emphasizes the necessity for a comprehensive and coordinated treatment strategy to optimize outcomes. It highlights the importance of continued research and education in managing such rare and severe injuries."

We report on a 23-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department with a one-day history of severe abdominal pain and multiple episodes of vomiting. On examination, his heart rate was 110 beats per minute. He had a non-distended, tense, and tender abdomen, localized to the epigastrium. He gave a history of drug abuse with recreational drugs (heroin, cannabis, and benzodiazepines). During resuscitation, the nasogastric tube yielded an aspirate of about 1 L of dark-colored hemorrhagic fluid. There was no gas under the diaphragm on the erect abdominal X-ray. Six hours post-admission and resuscitation, exploratory laparotomy was performed due to sepsis. During surgery, 250 mL of brownish-red fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity. Most of the body of the stomach along the greater curvature was gangrenous from the angle of His up to the incisura angularis along the greater curvature. The left gastric and gastroepiploic arteries were found clotted, while the pulsations of other feeding arteries were normal. A sleeve gastrectomy was performed following the resection of the gangrenous portion. Postoperative recovery, initially in the ICU and subsequently in the surgical ward, was uneventful. On follow-up, no weight loss or nutritional deficiency was observed."

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancies are a significant clinical concern, with 90 % occurring in the fallopian tubes. However, they can also manifest in other locations, including the cervix, ovary, and abdominal cavity. Abdominal pregnancies, which constitute less than 1 % of ectopic pregnancies, are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Among these, pregnancies located in the broad ligament are particularly rare and can sometimes be carried to term. This case report discusses a 27-year-old patient presenting with a 14-week pregnancy diagnosed in the broad ligament, highlighting the challenges in prenatal diagnosis and the potential complications associated with this condition. The report details the clinical management, including an exploratory laparotomy and subsequent treatment, and underscores the importance of awareness and timely intervention in cases of broad ligament ectopic pregnancies. This case contributes to the limited literature on this uncommon type of ectopic pregnancy and emphasizes the need for further research to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Ectopic pregnancy of the broad ligament is a relatively rare pathology documented in the literature. Its diagnosis is clinical and paraclinical, especially if ultrasound is performed early. Management is similar to that of an abdominal pregnancy. Maternal prognosis can be difficult if management is less than optimal in terms of surgery, anesthesia, resuscitation and the absence of blood products. This is why first-trimester ultrasound is so important. This case underscores the importance of awareness and timely intervention in managing broad ligament ectopic pregnancies, and highlighting the need for further research to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

The patient showed no further externalization of symptoms and had a suspicion of intussusception on a CT scan. A capsule endoscopy was performed, revealing an elevated and ulcerated lesion in the proximal jejunum near the Treitz angle. An attempt at enteroscopy was made, but it was suspended due to gastric stasis. The patient developed obstructive symptoms and underwent exploratory laparotomy, which required enterectomy. The histopathological examination confirmed that the lesion was an ulcerated lipoma. Lipomas of the small intestine are rare and challenging to diagnose.

According to the CARE checklist, we describe a rare case of blunt abdominal trauma with late diagnosis of jejunal perforation with an abscess that extensively dissected the retromuscular space. A 65 years-old female patient experienced multiple traumas after a traffic collision. Ten days after admission, the patient presented with swelling in the right abdomen. CT scan showed localised pneumoperitoneum and extensive collection affecting the right retrorectal space, reaching the ribs and preperitoneal space. Urgent laparotomy was performed and jejunal perforation with biliary peritonitis and extraperitoneal extension with dissection of the right retrorectal space were found. Intestinal resection with anastomosis was then performed. Exhaustive lavage of the cavity and retromuscular space with debridement of the necrotic posterior rectus lamina was required. Retrorectal drainage was placed. Primary closure of the aponeurosis was achieved using a small-bites technique with a slowly absorbable monofilament suture. Due to the weakness of the abdominal wall, an absorbable biosynthetic mesh impregnated with gentamicin was placed onlay. Negative pressure therapy was applied to the closed wound. Patient received antibiotics and CTs showed favourable evolution. No infectious complications or incisional hernia were reported after 12 months of follow-up. No cases of blunt trauma causing extensive AW infection have been reported in the literature. Whilst rare, this should be considered in traumatic patients. Our experience shows that they can be managed with surgical drainage and absorbable meshes can be considered in cases of fascial loss."

We examined the predictive values of the delta shock index (DSI), defined as the change in the shock index (SI) value from the scene to the initial reading in the emergency unit (i.e., subtracting the calculated SI at admission from SI at the scene), at a Level 1 trauma center. To explore whether high DSI is associated with severe injuries, more interventions, and worse outcomes [i.e., blood transfusion, exploratory laparotomy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and in-hospital mortality] in trauma patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted after data were extracted from the National Trauma Registry between 2011 and 2021. Patients were grouped based on DSI as low (≤ 0.1) or high (> 0.1). Data were analyzed and compared using χ 2 and Student's t-tests. Correlations between DSI and injury severity score (ISS), revised trauma score (RTS), abbreviated injury scale (AIS), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), trauma score-ISS (TRISS), HLOS, and number of transfused blood units (NTBU), were assessed using correlation coefficient analysis. The diagnostic testing accuracy for predicting mortality was determined using the validity measures of the DSI. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of mortality. This analysis included 13212 patients with a mean age of 33 ± 14 years, and 24% had a high DSI. Males accounted for 91% of the study population. The trauma activation level was higher in patients with a high DSI (38% vs 15%, P = 0.001). DSI correlated with RTS (r = -0.30), TRISS (r = -0.30), NTBU (r = 0.20), GCS (r = -0.24), ISS (r = 0.22), and HLOS (r = 0.14) (P = 0.001 for all). High DSI was associated with significantly higher rates of intubation, laparotomy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, massive transfusion activation, and mortality than low DSI. For mortality prediction, a high DSI had better specificity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio (77%, 99%, and 0.49%, respectively). After adjusting for age, emergency medical services time, GCS score, and ISS, multivariable regression analysis showed that DSI was an independent predictor of mortality (odds ratio = 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.35-2.76). In addition to sex-biased observations, almost one-quarter of the study cohort had a higher DSI and were mostly young. High DSI correlated significantly with the other injury severity scores, which require more time and imaging to be ready to use. Therefore, DSI is a practical, simple bedside tool for triaging and prognosis in young patients with trauma."

The stab wound extended through the temporal lobe and ended a few centimeters before the brainstem. The blade was removed under general anesthesia. Postoperative follow-up was satisfying without any neurological worsening. The control CT scan showed a remaining knife edge in the bone flap. It was decided to monitor the patient regularly, and he was discharged 3 days later.

We analyzed data from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program datasets from 2020 to 2022 for patients arriving from scene by POV, police, or GEMS. The primary outcome was 24-h survival. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounders. Further stratification was performed by mechanism. We used abbreviated Injury Severity Score (ISS) by body region to assess those with and without penetrating torso trauma. Patients arriving by POV had a lower median age than those arriving by GEMS and a higher proportion of pediatric patients. This group exhibited a lower incidence of blunt trauma but a higher incidence of penetrating trauma, along with fewer serious injuries across all body regions. Across all adjusted models, arrival by POV was associated with higher odds of 24-h survival, except for cases of penetrating torso trauma among pediatric patients. Patients arriving by police also had a lower median age but a reduced proportion of pediatric patients. This group showed a higher proportion of penetrating trauma and serious injuries to the thorax and abdomen. Police arrivals with blunt trauma had higher odds of 24-h survival, while those with penetrating trauma had lower odds of 24-h survival, a pattern consistent when stratifying by ISS greater than 15. This study highlights a survival advantage for trauma patients transported by POV compared to GEMS. Limitations include a lack of prehospital transport time and intervention data. While police transport showed improved survival for blunt trauma, it was associated with worse outcomes for penetrating trauma. These findings suggest that nontraditional transport methods may be beneficial in certain scenarios. Future research should aim to refine transport protocols, investigate the impact of nontraditional methods on transport time, and better understand the impact of prehospital interventions on patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune multisystem disease. Pericarditis in SLE can lead to severe effusion and cardiac tamponade, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. A 32-year-old woman at 21 weeks of gestation with a history of lupus pericarditis two years previously presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, fever, and weakness. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion, right ventricle failure, pulmonary hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. A chest X-ray suggested pericardial effusion accompanied by pulmonary edema. Due to worsening of the patient's health, a joint decision was made with her and her family to terminate the pregnancy. Most cardiac manifestations of SLE worsen during pregnancy and can lead to life-threatening conditions such as cardiac tamponade or congestive heart failure. This is a rare case of recurrent lupus pericarditis in pregnancy accompanied by massive pericardial effusion, heart failure and pulmonary edema. Management is challenging because the most effective drugs are known to be harmful to the fetus."

    "abstract": "Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, mucocutaneous pigmentation, and/or a family history of PJS. Intussusception in patient with PJS is a common complication presenting as abdominal pain and a feature of intestinal obstruction secondary to polyps. A 36-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with bilateral flank pain, melena, and generalized fatigue with multiple, black-pigmented lesions on her lips extending to mucosa of buccal cavity. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed multiple gastrointestinal polyps with jejuno-jejunal intussusception. Exploratory laparotomy revealed jejuno-jejunal intussusception with multiple pedunculated polyps. Segmental jejunal resection followed by jejunojejunal stapled anastomosis was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a hamartomatous polyp, confirming the diagnosis of PJS. PJS is a rare autosomal disorder due to a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene STK11, found on chromosome 19p13. The estimated prevalence of PJS ranges between 1 in 8300 and 1 in 280,000. Intussusception is one of the most common complications, occurring in almost half the patients. Surgical resection remains the recommended treatment for rapidly growing polyps associated with intussusception. Screening at regular intervals for early detection of cancers and recurrence of polyps after excision is recommended. Accurate diagnosis of PJS depends on childhood history, family history, physical examination, endoscopic evaluation, and genetic testing. Their presentation varies, ranging from gastointestinal bleeding to intestinal obstruction brought on by intussusception. Surgical resections remain the recommended treatment in patients with intussusception associated with large and rapidly growing polyps."

    "abstract": "Adult trauma centers, including combined pediatric and adult centers (CPACs), see high volumes of penetrating trauma. Few studies have compared outcomes of adolescents presenting with gunshot wounds at CPACs vs pediatric-only hospitals (POHs). This study aimed to compare injury patterns, complication, and mortality for adolescents sustaining gunshot wounds presenting to CPACs vs POHs, hypothesizing decreased associated risk of complication and mortality at CPACs. The TQIP database from 2017 to 2021 was queried for adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) with isolated gunshot wounds. Patients transferred or with brain injury were excluded. CPACs included centers with adult and pediatric American College of Surgeons verification, whereas POHs only had pediatric American College of Surgeons verification. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with in-hospital complications and mortality, controlling for age, injury severity score, vitals, operation, and blood transfusion. Of 3,064 adolescents presenting with gunshot wounds, 1,512 (49.3%) presented to CPACs. When compared with POH, CPAC patients were slightly older (median 16 vs 15 years old, p < 0.001) had increased injury severity score (median 9 vs 4, p < 0.001), and injury to the spine (9.3% vs 5.7%, p < 0.001), heart (2.3% vs 0.7%, p < 0.001), lung (19.1% vs 10.6%, p < 0.001), liver (8.5% vs 4.8%, p < 0.001), and spleen (3.2% vs 1.5%, p = 0.002). CPAC adolescents also had increased rate of emergent operation (31.9% vs 23.5%, p < 0.001). However, on multivariable analysis, CPAC adolescents had a similar associated risk of in-hospital complication (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.41, p = 0.68) and mortality (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48, p = 0.42). Adolescent patients with gunshot wounds had similar associated risk of mortality and complication when comparing POHs with CPACs. This suggests that adolescents with gunshot wounds receive similar care at both CPACs and POHs. Additional research is warranted to corroborate these findings."

    "title": "Delayed diagnosis of pediatric bladder rupture with atypical presentation after a minor fall.",
    "abstract": "Pediatric bladder injuries, though uncommon, typically result from blunt trauma, often associated with motor vehicle collisions. While most bladder injuries are linked to pelvic fractures, this association may be less common in children due to anatomical differences. Bladder injuries are classified as extraperitoneal, intraperitoneal, or combined, with intraperitoneal injuries being rarer but more prevalent in children due to their higher abdominal bladder position. This case report discusses a rare instance of delayed intraperitoneal bladder rupture in a young child following a relatively minor fall, emphasizing diagnostic challenges. A 4-year-old female presented with new onset abdominal pain, vomiting, and subjective fever three days after a minor fall. Initial evaluation revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness, elevated creatinine, and moderate ascites on ultrasound with no gross hematuria. Despite treatment for presumed acute kidney injury, the patient's condition worsened, leading to the identification of a large posterior dome bladder rupture via cystography. Surgical repair was performed, and the patient was discharged with a full recovery after sequential removal of urinary catheters. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Intraperitoneal bladder rupture can occur in healthy children after minor trauma and may not present acutely with the classic signs of gross hematuria and peritonitis. Emergency physicians should consider this diagnosis in young children with unexplained ascites, abdominal pain, hematuria, and renal failure, even with only a remote history of minor abdominal trauma."

    "abstract": "Acupuncture, an increasingly popular alternative medical therapy, has heightened the demand for information on its safety profile. This is a case report involving a 28-year-old female who presented with intense right-sided chest pain and breathlessness after an acupuncture session where needles were inserted into her chest wall. The immediate medical evaluation revealed a tension pneumothorax with radiographic evidence of a mediastinal shift, compelling, urgent intervention via chest tube insertion. The patient's symptoms persisted for 2 days before the pneumothorax diminished, facilitating the removal of the chest tube. This case emphasizes the atypical presentation of pneumothorax after acupuncture, suggesting a delayed onset of symptoms possibly related to the size of the bronchopleural fistula formed by the acupuncture needle. While acupuncture-related adverse events are uncommon, serious life-threatening complications like tension pneumothorax underscore the necessity for rigorous safety standards. Amidst the growing popularity of acupuncture, this report urges healthcare professionals to be aware of and report such incidents for enhanced patient education and safety. Trial Registration: This is not an interventional study. We only reported the patient's findings from our database as a case report."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a condition with impaired cardiac function by acute fluid accumulation in the pericardium. Extracardiac masses, such as a mediastinal hematoma, can also cause cardiac tamponade. We report a case of impending extrapericardial cardiac tamponade secondary to traumatic sternal fracture with expanding mediastinal hematoma. An 82-year-old male presented to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, he was hemodynamically stable. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm and sporadic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), which had been documented in his past Holter ECGs. Initial evaluation with a focused sonographic assessment for trauma was negative. However, subsequent computed tomography (CT) showed a small retrosternal hematoma with a sternal fracture and a rib fracture. On day 4, repeated ECG demonstrated more frequent PVCs, a change in morphology, and episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Follow-up CT and echocardiogram showed an expanding hematoma and compressed right ventricle. Cardiology and Surgery were consulted, and urgent surgical drainage of the hematoma was performed. The patient was discharged without complications on day 17. An expanding mediastinal hematoma after blunt chest trauma can cause extrapericardial tamponade. In this case, the hematoma caused a change in ECG and increased ventricular ectopy, which served as a critical indicator for successful surgical intervention before circulatory collapse occurred. Telemetry and repeat ECGs should be performed for the first few days following significant chest trauma. This case highlights the utility of continuous ECG monitoring, which provides clinicians with timely recognition of cardiac functional changes and a beneficial indication for appropriate intervention."

    "title": "Acute Large Bowel Obstruction Post Umbilical Hernia Repair Surgery: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "While large bowel obstruction (LBO) is a less common cause of bowel obstruction, it has a broad range of differentials. Its most common etiology in the United States is colorectal adenocarcinoma. Patients usually present with diffuse abdominal pain, constipation, abdominal distension, and nausea. Abdominal X-rays can quickly assess bowel dilation, but a CT scan is the gold standard to determine the location and severity of the blockage. The treatment can range from IV fluid to emergent colectomy. A 41-year-old male with a history of bronchitis and hypertension presented for a surgical consult six days post-incarcerated umbilical hernia repair. The patient complained of nausea, diffuse abdominal distension and tenderness, and inability to pass gas. Physical examination revealed a severely distended abdomen with rebound and guarding at the lower right quadrant. CT scan showed severely dilated ascending colon and cecum along with pneumatosis. There was also an obstructing mass at the sigmoid colon. A diagnosis of severe LBO with impending perforation was made, and the patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy. Subtotal colectomy was done with anastomosis between the ileum and sigmoid colon. The pathology report showed an 8.0 cm dilated cecum, necrosis of the ascending colon, and diverticulitis with scar fibrosis along the wall of the colonic membrane. The patient had an ileus and kidney injury postoperatively but they subsequently resolved. Diverticulitis is historically common in the elderly population, but recent studies have shown a rising incidence among younger individuals. It is a common cause of obstruction but rarely causes severe complications like pneumatosis and perforation that require emergent surgery. When occluded, the mass and patent ileocecal valve can cause closed-loop bowel syndrome. Even though an unhealthy diet is a known trigger for diverticulitis, surgery is possibly another factor in rare cases. Patients of all ages should be educated on the symptoms of diverticular disease, and surgical monitoring is key in those with known diverticulosis."

Pathological findings from the pericardial fluid revealed non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) pericardial large B-cell lymphoma (CD10-, BCL6+, and MUM1+). Although a diagnosis of fluid overload-associated large B-cell lymphoma was considered, GCB nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (CD10+, BCL6+, and MUM1+) was discovered through needle biopsy of the enlarged left axillary lymph node. Despite the two lymphomas exhibiting different expression levels of CD10, polymerase chain reaction assessing IgH gene rearrangement suggested a clonal relationship between them. Additionally, MYD88 L265P mutation was confirmed using Sanger sequencing in both samples, suggesting the MCD type. Our case highlights a discrepancy between the Hans' criteria and the gene expression profile-based cell of origin."

    "abstract": "Crystalloid administration during early resuscitation of bleeding trauma patients is recommended by current guidelines, yet evidence supporting this practice is limited. We aimed to evaluate the trends in the utilization of crystalloids during the last decade and to determine the threshold crystalloid volume independently associated with mortality risk in trauma patients at risk of or experiencing shock. A retrospective cohort study using data from the Israel National Trauma Registry (January 2013 to December 2022) was conducted. We included patients ≥16-years-old transported by emergency medical services from the injury scene and subsequently hospitalized. Inclusion criteria included systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg and/or shock index >1 in the field or emergency department (ED). Patients transferred between facilities, those who received prehospital blood products, or those who suffered burns were excluded. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between the total volume of crystalloid administered during prehospital and ED treatment and the primary outcome, adjusting for clinical variables. Among 10,707 eligible patients, the median age was 39.0 years (IQR 25.0-65.0), 63.5 % were male, and 81.4 % suffered from blunt trauma, mainly caused by motor vehicle collisions. There was a trend toward reduced crystalloid use over the study period both prehospital and in the ED. Crystalloid volumes ≥2 liters were independently associated with increased mortality with an aOR of 1.47 (95 % CI 1.09-1.96, p = 0.01) for 2000-2499 ml and an aOR of 1.49 (95 % CI 1.08-2.04, p = 0.01) for ≥2500 ml. Older age, male gender, lower blood pressure, and severe injury (ISS >15) were also independently associated with higher mortality. The administration of ≥2 liters of crystalloids during the initial phase of care was independently associated with increased mortality in hemodynamically compromised trauma patients. These findings support the judicious and goal-directed use of crystalloids in the resuscitation of trauma patients."

Dehiscence is also reported in cases following total laparoscopic hysterectomy, with a prevalence of 0.87%. This case report details the emergency management of a 59-year-old female who complained of abdominal and pelvic pain and the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina. The patient reported a history of laparoscopic total hysterectomy 6 months prior to presenting at the Emergency Department. A clinical examination revealed small bowel loops protruding through the vagina. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy through a Pfannenstiel incision, and the terminal ileum was found prolapsing through the vaginal cuff. The bowel loops were identified as viable and the vagina was sutured. The patient had an unremarked post operative course. This case report showcases that in patients with transvaginal evisceration, immediate surgical management is crucial in order to avoid serious life threatening complications, and both surgeons and gynecologists should remain vigilant regarding this pathology."

To our knowledge, this is the first documented case in Yemen. We report a case of a 39-year-old pregnant woman at 32 weeks of gestation who presented with acute abdominal pain, constipation, and signs of peritonitis. Diagnostic imaging was limited due to the pregnancy, but an ultrasound revealed fluid collection in the pelvis and massive pneumoperitoneum, suggesting a rupture of the hollow viscus. An emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed a perforated sigmoid volvulus with necrosis of the sigmoid wall; as a result, we resected a nonviable colon and performed Hartmann's procedure. After five days, we discharged the patient in excellent condition, and the fetus was monitored as healthy. Diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus during pregnancy is challenging due to the overlap of symptoms with normal pregnancy. Prompt surgical intervention is crucial to prevent maternal and fetal complications. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving general surgeons, obstetricians, and neonatologists in managing this rare condition. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for improving maternal and fetal outcomes in cases of sigmoid volvulus during pregnancy."

Conservative management strategies have demonstrated success in similar cases, emphasizing the importance of prompt recognition and multidisciplinary management. This case contributes to the paucity of literature regarding this rare complication underscoring the necessity for detailed preoperative planning to avoid complications in PCNL, especially in patients with complex renal anatomy.

The aim of this article is to outline the characteristics of gunshot and blast injuries, including emergency diagnostics and initial surgical treatment.Due to multiple high-energy penetrating injuries, barotrauma, or blunt trauma, affected patients are usually polytraumatized, with multiple organ damage and an average Injury Severity Score (ISS) of > 36. In addition to the complexity of the wounds, they are characteristically severely contaminated. After pre-hospital treatment, life-threatening injuries and conditions should be identified and initially treated in the trauma room phase. The procedure should be based on a standardized, internal hospital emergency medical and emergency surgical algorithm. Damage control surgery can then be used to treat acutely life-threatening complications of gunshot and blast injuries in order to prevent the fatal triad and the occurrence of further early complications. Examples of interventions include debridement and decontamination, fracture stabilization (external fixators and splints), surgical decompression (skull, thorax, compartment syndromes) and surgical hemostasis."

We presented tension gastrothorax in two patients with distended stomach in the thorax, in which tension pneumothorax and pleural effusion/empyema-like images were created, based on plain X-rays taken at the first admission in the emergency department, which may cause diagnostic confusion. The tension gastrothorax can cause mediastinal shift, which can lead to respiratory distress and eventually cardiac arrest secondary to obstructive shock.

He suffered immediate vision loss and pain. The eye trauma resulted in pupil damage, lens structural damage, retinal tears, a macular hole, and extensive retina commotio. Despite being a seemingly innocuous training accident, he developed a complex monocular trauma. He underwent emergency surgery that successfully closed the macular hole and prevented retinal detachment. Visual recovery in the right eye was not perfect; however, the player was able to make a full return to training within six weeks and play competitive football within eight weeks. This exemplifies a rare case in which a routine, everyday training ground event resulted in a highly complex ocular injury.

We hypothesize that skin closure technique is not associated with SSI. We performed a retrospective review of adult patients (>18 y) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for EGS conditions within 6 h of surgical consultation from 2015 to 2019. Patients whose fascia was not closed during the index operation were excluded. Patients were divided into groups: open skin (OS) and closed skin (CS). OS included negative pressure wound therapy or wet-to-dry gauze; CS included closure with staples or sutures. Our primary outcome was the rate of SSI. The cohort comprised 388 patients: 42.3% OS (n = 164) and 57.7% CS (n = 224). The OS group had greater rates of systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS] (54.9% versus 27.7%, P < 0.0001), hollow viscus perforation [HVP] (71.3% versus 20.5%, P < 0.0001), and peritoneal drains (51.2% versus 17.9%, P < 0.0001). Rates of OS management increased as wound class severity increased (0% [I] versus 12.2% [II] versus 15.9% [III] versus 72% [IV], P < 0.0001). The SSI rate for the cohort was 3.6% (n = 14); there was no difference in SSI rates (2.7% versus 4.9%, P = 0.3) between the CS or OS groups. Median length of stay was longer for the OS group (10 d versus 6.5 d, P < 0.0001).

Among all causes of LBO colonic volvulus is the third leading cause worldwide. Colonic volvulus is an axial rotation of the colon around a fixed point. Splenic flexure volvulus is the least common location for colonic volvulus, accounting for <1 % of cases. A 41-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a history of crampy abdominal pain, abdominal distension and failure to pass feces and flatus of three days duration. He had a history of laparotomy 1 year back, at which time de-rotation of the splenic flexure was done. This time, while preparing the patient for emergency laparotomy, he passed both feces and flatus. On the same admission, he was operated and left hemicolectomy and end to end anastomosis was done. Due to splenic flexure attachments to the left upper quadrant via Splenic ligament splenic flexure colonic volvulus is very rare. Risk factors include congenitally absent ligaments, congenital bands, acquired adhesions, previous colonic surgery. With the appropriate clinical setting radiographic diagnosis is suggested when there is a markedly dilated, air-filled colon with an abrupt termination at the anatomic splenic flexure, two widely separated air- fluid levels, and an empty descending and sigmoid colon. Following adequate resuscitation urgent exploratory laparotomy is recommended in splenic flexure volvulus. If the clinical condition of the patient allows colonic resection with continuity restoration is the preferred conventional approach."

    "abstract": "Ventricular perforation or rupture caused by Impella (Abiomed Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) is extremely rare. The Japanese registry of Impella usage reported that the incidence of perforation was 0.02 % in all Impella cases. Herein, we report a rare case of fulminant myocarditis that survived cardiac insufficiency with the combination therapy of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and Impella 5.5 and left ventricular free wall rupture following Impella removal with emergent surgery. It should be emphasized that the rupture occurred in an unexpected situation. The transesophageal echocardiography-guided removal led to the immediate identification of the cardiac tamponade and consequent survival. Ventricular rupture due to Impella implantation is likely to occur under several conditions: the use of Impella 5.5, friable ventricular wall structure, and the proximity of the device tip to the wall structure. In cases with these factors, extra caution must be observed during the insertion and removal of the device as these entail a greater risk of ventricular injury."

    "abstract": "This report presents a case of an acute Type A aortic dissection in a young patient with atypical symptoms, highlighting the importance of prompt radiology-aided diagnosis and intervention. A 29-year-old male with no significant medical history presented with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, along with leg numbness. Extensive imaging revealed an ascending aortic dissection with a 5.1 cm aneurysm and moderate-to-severe pericardial effusion. After initial stabilization, an emergency Bentall procedure with mechanical valve replacement was performed. It emphasizes the importance of considering aortic dissection in young patients with atypical symptoms, as it can mimic other conditions, complicating timely diagnosis and management. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient stabilized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early recognition and rapid surgical intervention are crucial in managing atypical aortic dissection cases, especially in younger patients with minimal risk factors."

    "abstract": "Ambulance missions involving pediatric patients are common in emergency medical services (EMS) globally, with variations in prevalence based on geographic location. This retrospective cohort study analyzes the prehospital physician staffed units (p-EMS) in Stockholm, assignment dispatches and the prehospital characteristics and interventions involved, from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022. Utilizing data from LogEze, a quality assurance system, we reviewed all Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) operations in the Stockholm Region, which totaled 4,682 pediatric assignments. The analysis included dispatch types and interventions assessing the frequency and nature of pediatric prehospital missions. Pediatric cases constituted 20.0 % of RRV dispatches, with the majority involving respiratory distress, seizures, and blunt trauma. Despite high dispatch rates, advanced medical interventions were seldom required, indicating most pediatric cases were not severe. Stand-downs occurred in 30.1 % of cases, reflecting the cautious approach in pediatric dispatches. Furthermore, the study observed a significant reliance on p-EMS for complex pediatric cases, underscoring the value of specialized training and resources in managing such emergencies. The study highlights the crucial role of p-EMS in enhancing pediatric emergency care in Stockholm. Despite frequent pediatric dispatches, the low incidence of severe cases underscores the need for precise triage and resource allocation. This analysis supports the need for continuous training and resource optimization in p-EMS to ensure high-quality care for pediatric patients across varied emergency scenarios."

A 42-year-old female with polycystic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease stage III presented with severe abdominal pain, fever, and inability to tolerate oral intake. The patient was a previous smoker who smoked 0.5 packs per day for 25 years. Initial evaluation revealed leukocytosis and elevated creatinine. A CT scan identified pneumoperitoneum and mild sigmoid diverticulitis, suggesting a perforated viscus. She underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy, which confirmed the CT findings and resulted in an appendectomy, sigmoid colon resection, and ostomy creation. Postoperatively, the patient faced complications, including recurrent pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema, detected through follow-up CT scans, leading to further surgical interventions. CT imaging was pivotal in diagnosing, monitoring, and guiding treatment, with noncontrast CT being beneficial given her renal impairment. Early diagnosis and CT imaging are crucial in managing complicated diverticulitis. Postoperative monitoring with CT scans is essential for detecting complications. Follow-up care should include regular colonoscopies to assess diverticular disease and dietary modifications to prevent recurrence. Combining clinical, surgical, and radiologic data ensures effective management and improves patient outcomes."

Interestingly, it is also a rare late complication after gastric bypass. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in 2004 complicated by jejunal intussusception in 2011 for which a small bowel resection was performed. The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with intractable abdominal pain and nausea. The diagnosis of intussusception was made by abdominal CT scan. Initial laparoscopic reduction of the small bowel intussusception resulted in recurrence within the first 24 hours, and exploratory laparotomy with isoperistaltic small bowel anastomosis was then performed. Careful consideration in isolated reduction of uncomplicated recurrent small bowel intussusception is important. Our case describes an unsuccessful simple reduction in a patient with recurrent intussusception status post gastric bypass. While reduction is more conservative, in patients with recurrent intussusception, it is important to consider a reconstructive option such as resection and reconstruction of the jejunojejunostomy, as it appears to be associated with acceptable complication rates and the lowest risk of recurrence."

    "abstract": "Colonic actinomycosis is an uncommon chronic infection associated with granulomatous inflammation resulting multiple abscesses and sinuses. Common modes of presentation include weight loss, malaise, abdominal pain, and abdominal mass, which might mimic neoplasia. A 60-year-old female presented with painful lump in right iliac fossa (RIF) for 3 weeks and acute complete bowel obstruction for 3 days. Examination revealed hard, irregular and fixed lump in the RIF. Ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis showed ileocecal mass while contract enhanced computed tomography (CECT) suggested carcinoma transverse colon with mesenteric metastasis. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy and right extended hemicolectomy for densely adherent mass incorporating distal ileum, cecum, ascending and proximal transverse colon with adjacent mesenteries. However, histopathological examination revealed colonic actinomycosis. The patient was commenced on intravenous penicillin G followed by oral amoxicillin. Colonic actinomycosis is a rare infection presenting with pain abdomen, change in bowel habit, and rarely, abdominal mass. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult due to lack of pathognomonic clinical, laboratory and radiological findings. Differentiation from other diseases such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, colon carcinoma, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis is challenging. Diagnosis is confirmed histologically by presence of Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott- positive sulphur granules with filaments. Newer molecular diagnoses are under study. Medical therapy is main line of treatment, most effectively with parenteral and oral beta lactams. Actinomycosis may present with aggressive invasion and infiltration of adjacent organs, mesentery, and abdominal wall mimicking malignancy. Acute presentation with bowel obstruction would mandate surgical intervention."

A 66-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with shortness of breath. Blood tests showed high C-reactive protein, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a large amount of pericardial fluid as well as a foreign body with high bone density in the pericardial sac. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed no evidence of penetration of the esophageal or gastric mucosa. Emergency open chest surgery was performed, and the pericardial sac was filled with copious amounts of pus. The fish bone-like foreign body was found to penetrate the pericardial membrane from the diaphragmatic side. The foreign body was removed, a drainage tube was placed, and the chest was closed. After 2 weeks of postoperative antibiotics, the patient was discharged from the hospital in stable general condition. Three months after the surgery, the patient had no recurrence of pericarditis. We reported a rare case of gastrointestinal perforation by a fish bone, resulting in pericardium, which was treated by surgical drainage."

Herein, we present a case of cardiac tamponade due to coronary artery injury after a left upper lobectomy for lung cancer and discuss the possible cause of coronary artery injury. An 82-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, emphysema, chronic heart failure-associated cardiomegaly, and a history of aortic stenting for an abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent a left upper lobectomy without mediastinal nodal dissection for lung cancer. Twenty-eight hours postoperatively, he lost consciousness and went into shock vitals; computed tomography revealed cardiac tamponade. Emergency surgery was performed, which revealed a left circumflex artery laceration. Although the laceration was successfully repaired, he had a gastrointestinal perforation and developed septic shock. He died 35 days after the lung surgery. Intraoperative injury to the heart cannot be ruled out, but the site of the coronary artery injury was located far from the hilum outside the surgical field during the lobectomy. Three-dimensional computed tomography showed that the site of injury was close to the multiple firing junction of the staples that divided the anterior interlobar fissure. Two staples at the multiple firing junction, which protruded perpendicularly to the cut surface, could injure the coronary artery. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the intraoperative manipulation procedures contributed to the coronary artery injury, we speculate that the protruding staples might penetrate the pericardium after lung expansion and eventually injured the coronary artery."

We aimed to improve the speed and efficiency of resuscitation for critically ill trauma patients in the emergency department by involving interventional radiology and a second surgeon. In 2017 our community, non-academic level II trauma center implemented the Double 90 rule-for trauma patients with 2 confirmed systolic blood pressures <90 mm Hg-which involves a second activation including the interventional radiology team, backup trauma surgeon, and operating room charge nurse. We retrospectively reviewed our trauma registry to compare data for high-level trauma patients before (2016, \"Pre-Dbl90\") and 3 consecutive years after intervention (2018-2020, \"Dbl90\"). Among 613 patients who met criteria for our highest level of trauma activation, 100 either had activation of the Double 90 rule (Dbl90 patients, n = 76) or met Double 90 rule criteria (Pre-Dbl90 patients, n = 24). The groups were similar in age, sex, injury severity score, penetrating trauma incidence, and admission vitals. Median time to computed tomography decreased throughout the study period, from 34 min in 2016 to 18 min in 2020 (P < .001). Median time to first hemorrhage control procedure decreased from 118 min (2016) to 43 min (2020), (P = .013). Mean packed red blood cell transfusion decreased from 9.1 to 4.8 units (P = .016). Mortality rates were similar between groups. The Double 90 rule is effective for expediting trauma care starting in the emergency department, shortening the times to computed tomography, hemorrhage control intervention, and decreasing packed red blood cell transfusion."

    "title": "Bridging Hospital Resource Variability: Adapting the Escape Room to Integrate Procedure Teaching for Emergency Medicine Trainees in India.",
    "abstract": "This is an in-person escape room and procedure simulation activity based on complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in India, which was created by using local HIV management guidelines. Emergency Medicine (EM) trainees of all post-graduate levels are the target audience. This may also be used by trainees in other specialties, such as infectious disease or internal medicine, who require an understanding of HIV and its complications. This escape room can be completed in teams of varying sizes and is designed to be adaptable to local resource availability. Patients with HIV present to the Emergency Department (ED) for a variety of reasons such as initial viral syndrome, medication side effects, and opportunistic infections. While the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly increased the life expectancy of patients living with HIV and decreased the incidence of classical opportunistic infections, EM providers should still be vigilant and competent in diagnosing and managing these pathologies. This is particularly critical in India, where the prevalence of HIV was most recently estimated at 0.22% (2.2 million people older than 15 years) in 2020.1 This patient population, primarily infected through unprotected heterosexual contact, is at high risk for interruptions in ART and development of opportunistic infections for a variety of reasons including migration for work, low social status of women, and significant social stigma against HIV.2 Simulation is an educational opportunity to review these high-acuity low-occurrence presentations to prepare EM trainees for independent practice. By the end of the escape room, learners should be able to: 1) describe the mechanism of action of antiretroviral therapies available in India, 2) prescribe initial antiretroviral therapy to a patient presenting to the emergency department with a new diagnosis of HIV, 3) develop a differential diagnosis for a patient with HIV presenting to the ED with chest pain, 4) identify common dermatologic manifestations of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV, 5) identify computerized tomography scan and lumbar puncture features for central nervous system infections seen in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), 6) identify red flag features and appropriate workup for a patient with HIV presenting with a headache to the ED, 7) interpret images obtained during a Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hemorrhage (RUSH) exam, 8) identify cardiac tamponade and perform a pericardiocentesis, and 9) communicate and collaborate as a team to manage a complex, unstable patient with HIV in the ED. We sought to create and implement an educational tool that could meet the complex education needs of EM trainees while being low cost, easily adapted to local resources, and engaging for trainees. Hospitals participating in the Masters in Emergency Medicine (MEM) program, a global partnership between the Ronald Reagan Institute for Emergency Medicine at the George Washington University and 18 hospitals in India, have resource variability for traditional simulation. The escape room created combines simulation, content review specific to the contextual practice of EM in India focused on HIV and its complications, and critical procedure teaching on pericardiocentesis. This innovation framework is based on Kolb's experiential learning cycle and incorporates the gamification principles of a sense of autonomy, perception of competitiveness, and learner-relatedness.3-4 Escape rooms have been shown to engage learners, and low-fidelity procedure models could further maximize the experience for learners in resource variable settings.5 A pericardiocentesis model was adapted from Lord et al.'s low-fidelity model, ensuring it could be assembled with materials readily available in-country.6. We adapted the escape room format to combine simulation, content review, and procedural training in a cost-effective, contextually relevant, and scalable way. The escape room was trialed using a case of chest pain and altered mental status caused by a pericardial effusion due to tuberculosis in a patient with HIV. Local practice patterns and guidelines were used to develop puzzles and clinical clues. A pericardiocentesis model was constructed using materials readily available in India. Pre- and post-surveys were developed to assess baseline trainee experience with escape rooms, self-reported knowledge of the differential diagnosis and management for altered mental status, and ways to incorporate escape room content into daily practice. A total of 47 trainees participated; 41 of 47 participants completed both pre- and post-surveys (87% response rate). Participants represented all program trainee levels: 49% (n = 20) PGY-1, 27% (n = 11) PGY-2, and 24% (n = 10) PGY-3. Based on a score greater than seven on a 1-10 Likert scale, the escape room was rated as \"highly effective\" by 93.5% of respondents in reviewing medical knowledge. The trainees were allotted 60 minutes to escape the room; the median time for escape room completion was 57 minutes. The escape room and pericardiocentesis model cost under $100 USD, were repeated up to six times in one day, and could be recycled for future use. Utilizing simulation in the escape room format that can be adaptable to variable resource settings is a valuable educational tool. The integrated escape room and procedure training proved to be an effective educational tool that was scalable and maintained efficacy across variable hospital resource levels. The next step includes adapting this format for other disease pathologies. This is a useful way to meet the education needs of MEM program trainees, regardless of hospital resource availability, that could be replicable in other EM training programs.

    "abstract": "Graves' disease, the most prevalent cause of hyperthyroidism, is an autoimmune disorder associated with several cardiovascular complications. The occurrence of acute pericarditis within the context of Graves' disease, is very rare. We present an uncommon case of cardiac tamponade in a patient diagnosed with Graves' disease. A female patient, was admitted with symptoms of dyspnea and palpitations. Clinical examination revealed Beck's triad. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large pericardial effusion with significative respiratory variations, indicating an urgent pericardiocentesis. Thyroid function tests revealed hyperthyroidism with positive TSH-receptor antibodies, and elevated anti-TPO antibodies. Cardiac tamponade, induced by acute pericarditis in Graves' disease is an uncommon entity. Typically, the diagnosis is established on a detailed history and physical examination, supported by specific investigations, including suppressed levels of TSH along with elevated free T4 levels and thyroid receptor antibodies. Pericardiocentesis, NSAIDs, betablockers, associated with antithyroid medications constitute the mainstay of treatment."

    "abstract": "The complications associated with cardiac device implants ranges between 5.3% and 14.3%. Cardiac perforation due to \"leads\" represent a very rare complication of cardiac device implantation, ranging between 0.3% and 0.7%. Clinically, they can manifest different, nonspecific symptoms; hence, the diagnosis may not be immediate. Our clinical case describes the successful treatment of cardiac tamponade occurring in a Caucasian 79-year-old man following a pacemaker implantation. Two days after the procedure, the patient reported an episode of nonspecific chest pain associated with syncope. The echocardiogram performed revealed a pericardial effusion in the apical area, along the right chambers, with a thickness of 7 mm, not hemodynamically significant. A chest computed tomography scan with contrast showed hemopericardium (maximum thickness of 11 mm), caused by an atrial perforation. A few hours later, the patient experienced hemodynamic instability. For this reason, an urgent sternotomy was performed with drainage of a significant hemopericardial effusion, revealing a perforation of the upper free wall of the right atrium with pericardial injury caused by the retractable screw lead. The perforation site was sutured and the sternal wound was closed. The patient was discharged after 4 days without further complications. At the control visit, scheduled 30 days after the hospital discharge, the patient was in good conditions. Although the atrial perforations from leads are very rare complications of pacemaker implantation procedures, they are potentially lethal. In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the need, before hospital discharge, of an accurate screening for evaluation the pericardial effusion in patients that undergo to the cardiac implantable electronic devices."

    "abstract": "Emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians manage patients with traumatic pneumothoraxes. These may be simple pneumothoraxes that are less clinically impactful, or tension pneumothoraxes that disturb perfusion, lead to shock, and impart significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Needle thoracostomy is the most common EMS treatment of tension pneumothorax, but despite the potentially life-saving value of needle thoracostomy, reports indicate frequent misapplication of the procedure as well as low rates of successful decompression. This has led some to question the value of prehospital needle thoracostomy and has prompted consideration of alternative approaches to management (e.g., simple thoracostomy, tube thoracostomy). EMS clinicians must determine when pleural decompression is indicated and optimize the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. Furthermore, there is also ambiguity regarding EMS management of open pneumothoraxes. To provide evidence-based guidance on the management of traumatic pneumothoraxes in the EMS setting, the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP) performed a structured literature review and developed the following recommendations supported by the evidence summarized in the accompanying resource document. EMS identification of a tension pneumothorax must be guided by a combination of risk factors and physical findings, which may be augmented by diagnostic technologies.EMS clinicians should recognize the differences in the clinical presentation of a tension pneumothorax in spontaneously breathing patients and in patients receiving positive pressure ventilation (PPV).EMS clinicians should not perform pleural decompression in patients with simple pneumothoraxes but should perform pleural decompression in patients with tension pneumothorax, if within the clinician’s scope of practice.When within scope of practice, EMS clinicians should use needle thoracostomy as the primary strategy for pleural decompression of tension pneumothorax in most cases. EMS clinicians should take a patient-individualized approach to performing needle thoracostomy, influenced by factors known to impact chest wall thickness and risk for iatrogenic injury.Simple thoracostomy and tube thoracostomy may be used by highly trained EMS clinicians in select clinical settings with appropriate medical oversight and quality assurance.EMS systems must investigate and adopt strategies to confirm successful pleural decompression at the time thoracostomy is performed.Pleural decompression should be performed for patients with traumatic out-of-hospital circulatory arrest (TOHCA) if there are clinical signs of tension pneumothorax or suspicion thereof due to significant thoraco-abdominal trauma. Empiric bilateral decompression, however, is not routinely indicated in the absence of such findings.EMS clinicians should not routinely perform pleural decompression of suspected or confirmed simple pneumothorax prior to air-medical transport in most situations.EMS clinicians may consider placement of a vented chest seal in spontaneously breathing patients with open pneumothoraxes.In patients receiving PPV who have open pneumothoraxes, chest seals may be harmful and are not recommended.EMS physicians play an important role in developing curricula and leading quality management programs to both ensure that EMS clinicians are properly trained in the recognition and management of tension pneumothorax and to ensure that interventions for tension pneumothorax are performed appropriately, safely, and effectively."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has primarily been characterized by respiratory symptoms, but emerging evidence suggests multi-organ involvement, including the gastrointestinal tract. This case report aims to highlight colon perforation as a rare but significant complication in COVID-19 patients. We present two cases of male patients, aged 38 and 33, who were admitted with severe COVID-19 symptoms and required intubation and ventilator support. Both patients developed abdominal distension during their ICU stay, prompting surgical consultations. In the first case, a 38-year-old male developed septic shock and abdominal distension on day 29 of his hospital stay. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 2 mm perforation in the sigmoid colon, which was managed with Hartmann's procedure. In the second case, a 33-year-old male developed abdominal distension one week post-admission. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 2 mm perforation in the mid-transverse colon, managed initially with a primary two-layer repair and later with a transverse loop colostomy due to additional perforations. These cases emphasize the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for gastrointestinal complications, such as colon perforation, in COVID-19 patients. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial for managing this life-threatening complication. Further research is needed to understand the incidence and underlying mechanisms of colon perforation in COVID-19 patients."

    "abstract": "Mucinous neoplasms of the appendix, including low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs), are rare but significant due to their potential for peritoneal dissemination. These tumors are often discovered incidentally during imaging or surgery for unrelated conditions. The presence of mucinous material in the peritoneum raises concern for pseudomyxoma peritonei, necessitating careful intraoperative and postoperative management. A 52-year-old male presented with testicular pain, leading to a diagnosis of seminoma. Staging computerized tomography (CT) revealed a dilated appendix with a surrounding fluid collection, suggestive of a ruptured mucocele. Exploratory laparotomy uncovered a large mucinous mass encasing the appendix, with mucinous deposits in the peritoneum. Final pathology confirmed an invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, well-differentiated, arising in the background of a low-grade mucinous appendiceal neoplasm. The invasive component extended into the subserosa (pT3), while the LAMN component involved the serosa (pT4a). When mucin is found intraoperatively, surgeons should consider appendectomy with possible conversion to an open approach for thorough exploration. Emergency HIPEC is unnecessary; instead, it should be planned electively after complete cytoreduction. The prognosis depends on the extent of the disease and the success of cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)."

It is characterized by relative bradycardia, low-voltage electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiomyopathy, and pericardial effusion. Here, we present a case of cardiac tamponade in untreated hypothyroidism. A 49-year-old male with no prior medical or psychiatric history presented to the Emergency Department for cognitive slowing, weakness, and inappropriate behavior for several weeks. Vital signs were significant for bradycardia with normal blood pressure. Examination revealed that the patient was disheveled and alert but forgetful with slow speech, along with ataxia and muscle wasting. The EKG showed low-voltage sinus bradycardia. Laboratory workup was notable for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of more than 100 mcIU/mL, with low free T4 and T3. Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin antibodies were elevated, confirming a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Treatment with intravenous levothyroxine, triiodothyronine, and hydrocortisone was started. An echocardiogram revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade. A pericardial drain was placed, and it drained 980 mL of sanguineous fluid. Serial echocardiograms showed a stable posterior effusion with no recurrence of the anterior pericardial effusion. Gradually, the patient's mentation, hemodynamics, and electrolyte levels improved. He was discharged on oral levothyroxine. TSH values showed sequential improvement. A large pericardial effusion with tamponade is a rare, life-threatening complication of untreated hypothyroidism. Clinicians must promptly identify myxedema and replace thyroid hormone to prevent the progression of pericardial effusion to tamponade and reverse its pathophysiology, maintaining a high level of suspicion in those at risk of poor healthcare access or inadequate health literacy."

    "abstract": "Atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is an unfamiliar entity that is potentially life-threatening if there is a delay in the diagnosis. Due to its rarity and its non-specific presentation, it can be a challenge to diagnose early. In this report, we present a case of a 42-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department with nonspecific abdominal pain and had no past medical history. The patient presented abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and sweating. On examination, the patient was found to be tachycardic and mildly hypotensive, with mild left upper quadrant tenderness, and a lactate of 4 mmol/L on venous blood gas analysis. He was urgently transferred to the resuscitation area, where resuscitation commenced. Further investigations revealed significant anemia. The contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen performed revealed a 13-cm splenic hemostasis suggestive of non-traumatic splenic rupture. The patient lacked any history of blunt trauma or family history that could account for the splenic rupture. The patient was taken to the theatre by the surgical team as he remained unstable. He received four units of blood in the theatre and underwent splenectomy due to the spleen being unsalvageable. Post-operatively, the patient was admitted to the high-dependency unit (HDU) for close monitoring. Histological examination of the splenic tissue revealed B-cell lymphoid hyperplasia and negative PCR for clonality. The patient was found to be IgG-positive for mumps and was not vaccinated for MMR. Surgeons believe it is the main cause of ASR, given that little literature available establishes the same. The case highlights the importance of consideration of ASR in patients presenting with unexplained abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability, even without evidence of trauma. Early imaging and operative intervention are lifesaving. The histologic findings indicate that there may be an associated hemopoietic disorder, and this case highlights the need for clinicians to consider splenic involvement in patients with mumps who present with abdominal pain or signs of hemodynamic instability."

We present the case of a 62-year-old male who, one week after CABG, developed progressive dyspnea, weakness, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed signs of cardiac tamponade, and echocardiography confirmed severe pericardial effusion with right ventricular collapse. Pericardial fluid analysis demonstrated chylous fluid with elevated triglycerides and protein levels, diagnosing chylopericardium-induced cardiac tamponade. Despite surgical intervention, an emergency pericardiocentesis was performed to stabilize the patient, followed by a pericardial window, thoracic duct ligation, and aggressive management with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and albumin; however, the patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in cardiac arrest and death. Chylopericardium following cardiac surgery is a rare but serious complication. It typically arises from inadvertent injury to the thoracic duct during the procedure, exacerbated by increased postoperative venous pressure. Diagnosis hinges on pericardiocentesis, revealing milky fluid with high triglycerides and protein levels. While conservative treatment may suffice in minor cases, severe chylopericardium often necessitates surgical intervention. This case underscores the challenge of diagnosing this rare complication and the critical need for timely intervention. This case highlights the importance of early recognition and aggressive management of post-CABG chylopericardium. Rapid deterioration, despite prompt treatment, emphasizes the need for heightened clinical awareness to prevent fatal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Caustic substance ingestion is an emergency and life-threatening condition as it leads to tissue damage, acidosis, and multiorgan failure. This study presents a case report of hydrochloric acid ingestion and notably dark-red urine output due to acute tubular necrosis. A 59-year-old male presented with attempted suicide by ingesting 500 mL of hydrochloric acid (37%), and complained of severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath. Upon arrival, his vital signs showed a temperature of 34.3°C, blood pressure of 104/77 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 135 beats per minute, and the Glasgow Coma Scale E4V2M6. Following Foley catheter insertion, dark, bloody urine resulting from acute tubular necrosis was observed. His creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, and urinalysis showed 38 red blood cells per high-power field. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated in the emergency room, revealing diffuse circumferential ulceration with necrosis in the esophagus (Zargar score grade 3b). An exploratory laparotomy was performed for acidosis with intractable shock, revealing up to 1500 mL of bloody ascites, and ischemic changes with loss of peristalsis throughout the small bowel to the cecum. Esophagostomy with T-tube insertion was performed. Notably, stomach necrosis with perforation was identified, prompting a surgical consultation for primary perforation closure. During the operation, the patient experienced hemodynamic instability. The family confirmed the \"Do Not Resuscitate\" status, and he died in a critical state. For corrosive injuries, early endoscopy was crucial in assessing the extent of the damage and guiding treatment in this patient. It is essential to perform an early endoscopic examination in cases of acute nephrotoxic tubular necrosis following hydrochloric acid ingestion. Surgical intervention is warranted if necrosis is detected in the corrosive tissue."

    "abstract": "The Predictive Optimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) calculator, a widely used interpretable artificial intelligence risk calculator, has been validated in population-based studies and shown to predict outcomes in patients who underwent emergency general surgery better than surgeons. We sought to prospectively validate POTTER. Patients undergoing an emergency exploratory laparotomy for nontrauma indications at 2 academic medical centers between June 2020 and March 2022 were included. POTTER preoperative risk calculations and postoperative outcomes were systematically recorded. POTTER's performance in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality, septic shock, respiratory failure, bleeding, and pneumonia was assessed using the c-statistic methodology. A total of 361 patients were included. The median age was 63 years (interquartile range 51 to 72 years), 45.4% were women, and the overall mortality and morbidity were 24.1% and 51.4%, respectively. POTTER predicted mortality accurately with a c-statistic of 0.90. POTTER also accurately predicted the occurrence of individual postoperative complications, with c-statistics ranging between 0.80 and 0.89. This is the first prospective validation of the artificial intelligence-enabled POTTER calculator. The superior accuracy, user-friendliness, and interpretability of POTTER make it a useful bedside tool for preoperative patient and family counseling."

Here, we describe a case of a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis via a right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter who presented to the emergency room for hypoxia at his skilled nursing facility. He had been discharged three days prior for treatment of a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) neck abscess, during which an uncomplicated right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter exchange was performed one day prior to discharge. On admission, bedside point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) showed a pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology. While receiving hemodialysis on his second day of admission, he was noted to have new hypotension, and repeat POCUS was concerning for tamponade. An urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with 895 mLs of serosanguinous drainage, followed by an additional 1400 mLs of serosanguinous drainage over the next 48 hours. Interventional radiology noted a contrast leak at the distal superior vena cava at the cavoatrial junction and suspected that the etiology for hemopericardium was an endovascular injury from tunneled dialysis catheter placement."

    "abstract": "It is incredibly rare to find stomach content inside an inguinal hernia. Here, we report a 77-year-old male patient with a long-standing history of a left inguinal hernia spanning over a decade. Notably, the hernia had become irreducible for the past 20 days. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a substantial left inguinal hernia extending into the left scrotal region causing bowel obstruction. The hernial neck measured approximately 5.5 cm in transverse diameter. Protrusion through this defect included the stomach, small and large bowel loops, and free mesenteric fat and vessels into the hernial sac. The patient underwent a life-saving exploratory laparotomy and the hernial sac was reduced and repaired. In conclusion, inguinal hernias are common, but stomach content cases are extremely rare and they usually present with gastric outlet obstruction or gastric perforation. CT is recommended to visualize the stomach within the hernia and to exclude complications. Surgical repair is usually the management of choice."

    "abstract": "Background: the role of the R202Q (c.605G>A, p.Arg202Gln) missense variant of the MEFV gene has been debated as either a benign polymorphism or a potentially pathogenic mutation. We report and discuss here the case of a young female with corticosteroid-dependent recurrent pericarditis carrying the homozygous R202Q variant, exhibiting distinctive clinical features possibly influenced by this genetic variant. Methods: a 30-year-old woman with a previous diagnosis of cancer and recent respiratory infection presented with severe pleuritic chest pain, hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. Initial diagnostic evaluation indicated cardiac tamponade, and emergent pericardiocentesis was performed. Despite initial treatment with NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids, the patient experienced multiple recurrences. Genetic testing identified homozygous R202Q variant in the MEFV gene. Given the corticosteroid dependency and recurrent nature of her condition, IL-1 inhibitor anakinra was introduced, leading to significant improvement, although tapering below 150 mg per week failed to prevent recurrences. Results: the introduction of anakinra resulted in rapid symptom relief and resolution of pericardial effusion. However, attempts to taper or discontinue anakinra led to pericarditis recurrences. Ultimately, a maintenance dose of 50 mg every three days was established, which maintained remission for 18 months without recurrence. Despite multiple tapering attempts, further reduction in anakinra dosage was unsuccessful without triggering relapses. Conclusions: the R202Q variant, although typically considered benign, may contribute to an autoinflammatory phenotype resembling familial Mediterranean fever. This case underscores the potential pathogenicity of the homozygous R202Q variant in recurrent pericarditis and its responsiveness to IL-1 inhibition. In patients with corticosteroid-dependent recurrent pericarditis, genetic testing for the R202Q variant should be considered when anti-IL-1 drugs cannot be withdrawn. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the variant's role in pericardial inflammation and guide personalized treatment strategies."

    "abstract": "A man in his early 30s presenting with chest pain was admitted for the management of acute pericarditis and evaluation of a subcarinal mass incidentally noted on chest imaging. Shortly after admission, he developed cardiac tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis revealed purulent pericardial fluid with polymicrobial anaerobic bacteria, raising concern for gastrointestinal source and broad intravenous antibiotics were given. The pericardial fluid reaccumulated despite an indwelling pericardial drain and intrapericardial fibrinolytic therapy, necessitating a surgical pericardial window. Concurrent fluoroscopic oesophagram demonstrated oesophageal perforation with fistulous connection to the subcarinal mass and mediastinal drain, suggestive of oesophagopericardial fistula. Pathology from biopsy of the subcarinal mass returned with focal large necrotising granulomas consistent with histoplasmosis. Antifungal treatment was initiated, and the patient was eventually discharged home with nasogastric feeding tube and oral antibiotics and antifungals. This is the first reported case of polymicrobial pericarditis secondary to acquired oesophagopericardial fistula likely induced by mediastinal histoplasma lymphadenitis."

    "abstract": "Tracheopericardial fistula is an extremely rare clinical condition caused by lung disease penetrating the tracheal wall and extending to the pericardial cavity, forming a fistula between the airway and the pericardial cavity. Since the pericardial cavity communicates with the respiratory tract, gases, airway secretions and pathogens can enter the cavity, leading to pneumopericardium, effusion and abscess. In severe cases, it can result in cardiac tamponade and cardiogenic shock. Only a few cases of TPF have been reported in the literature. In this report, a 72-year-old man with recurrent lung cancer presented with fever, chest tightness and chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in multiple leads, resembling an acute myocardial infarction. Emergency coronary angiography did not reveal significant stenosis. Further examination with chest computed tomography and bronchoscopy revealed pericardial effusion and a tracheal fistula, leading to the final diagnosis of TPF as a complication of lung cancer. This case aims to enhance understanding and recognition of this clinical entity to reduce misdiagnosis."

    "abstract": "Closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is rare and should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. The association between polymyalgia rheumatica and diverticular disease requires further research but may prompt clinicians to consider appropriate therapies in patients with both diseases. Jejunal diverticulosis is a sac-like outpouching of the intestinal wall that can cause complications such as diverticulitis, obstruction, abscess, perforation, or fistula formation. Complicated jejunal diverticulosis may present with acute abdomen and nonspecific symptoms which can lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. A 76-year-old male with a remote history of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) presented with sudden onset abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and inability to pass flatus. Physical exam revealed a distended and diffusely tender abdomen with signs of peritonitis. Laboratory test results were significant for neutrophil-dominant leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. CT scan of the abdomen with IV contrast revealed a contained perforation and a closed-loop small bowel obstruction in the mid-abdomen. The patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and resection of 100 cm of mid-jejunum which was found to have numerous diverticula surrounding the closed-loop obstruction and contained perforation. Pathology findings showed evidence of acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis. Jejunal diverticulosis with complications may present with an acute abdomen and peritonitis. Closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is uncommonly thought of and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Additionally, the association between PMR and diverticular disease is notable. While the patient had a remote history but no active PMR on presentation, studies suggest a possible association between gut inflammation and rheumatologic disease. This association should prompt clinicians to consider appropriate therapies and bear in mind the potential risk for diverticular perforation if glucocorticoids are given to treat PMR. Jejunal diverticulosis with multiple complications such as closed-loop bowel obstruction and contained perforation secondary to acute on chronic jejunal diverticulitis is rare and may present with an acute abdomen and nonspecific symptoms. Including rare pathologies as such in the differential diagnosis may prevent misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. While further investigation is needed, the association between diverticulosis and PMR is noteworthy as patients who present with both diseases would require mindful management due to the potential risk of diverticular perforation after treatment with steroids."

    "abstract": "The significance of computed tomography (CT)-based volume measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) in the treatment and prognosis of trauma patients is not yet fully understood. The conflicting results that have been reported may be attributable to differences in injury severity and the use of different measurement methods, including IVC index and volumetry. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between IVC volume and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and mortality in intubated trauma patients who were stable enough for initial CT imaging. A retrospective analysis was conducted on all consecutive trauma patients who underwent emergency tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation before initial whole-body CT imaging at a level-1 trauma center over a 12-year period (2008-2019). The IVC volume was determined on initial trauma CT and included in multivariable models with demographic and diagnostic data. Associations of overall RBC transfusion, massive transfusion, 24-h mortality, and 30-day mortality were assessed using logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 438 patients (75.3% male) with a median age of 50 years, and a median injury severity score (ISS) of 26 points were included in the analysis. Most of the patients (97.5%) had suffered from blunt trauma mechanisms. Median IVC volume was 36.25 cm3, and RBC transfusion and massive transfusion were performed in 197 and 90 patients, respectively. The 24-h and 30-day mortality rates were 7.3% and 23.3%, respectively. VCI volume was found to be independently associated with the necessity of RBC transfusion and 24-h mortality (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p = 0.01 and HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99, p = 0.025, respectively), while associations with massive transfusion and 30-day mortality were not statistically significant in multivariable analyses. Initial IVC volume may serve as a predictor of patients at risk for overall RBC transfusion requirements and 24-h mortality, suggesting the possibility of its diagnostic efficacy in short-term outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings."

    "abstract": "Penile fracture is a urological emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention for optimal outcomes. Early diagnosis based on clinical presentation and imaging if needed is crucial. Timely repair ensures the preservation of penile function and minimizes complications. Penile fracture (PF) is a rare but significant urological emergency characterized by the rupture of the tunica albuginea, often resulting from blunt trauma during sexual intercourse or other activities. The typical presentation includes sudden and severe penile pain, an audible \"cracking\" sound followed by swelling and deformity. While PF generally does not involve the urethra, bleeding from the urethral meatus suggests an associated urethral lesion. Imaging such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assess the extent of the injury. We report a case of a 28-year-old male who presented with sudden-onset penile pain, swelling, and blood dripping from the urethral meatus after a traumatic sexual encounter. The injury occurred during vigorous intercourse when his erect penis struck his partner's buttocks. He heard a cracking sound followed by immediate detumescence, penile curvature, and urethral bleeding. At the hospital, the patient exhibited tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. Examination revealed deviation of the penis to the right, urethrorrhagia, and a tender, swollen penis. A clinical diagnosis of bilateral corpora cavernosa injury and partial rupture of the penile urethra was made. A urethral catheter was placed with difficulty, draining initially reddish urine followed by clear urine. Laboratory tests showed normal hemoglobin and coagulation profiles with mild bacteriuria and hematuria. Due to clear clinical signs, no radiological imaging was performed before surgery. Surgical exploration performed 48 h postinjury revealed a PF involving the right corpus cavernosum and a complete rupture of the spongy urethra. The corpus cavernosum was repaired using Vicryl 2-0 sutures followed by urethroplasty with Vicryl 5-0. Postoperative care included antibiotics and analgesics. The patient had an uneventful recovery with preserved penile sensitivity and function. PF is a rare urological emergency that necessitates prompt diagnosis and management to prevent long-term complications. Although clinical presentation often suffices for diagnosis, imaging can be valuable in ambiguous cases. Surgical intervention is the preferred treatment, offering the best functional and cosmetic outcomes. This case underscores the importance of timely surgical repair to ensure favorable recovery and preservation of penile function."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension is defined as resting arterial pressure >20 mmHg. Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency where fluids accumulate in the pericardial sac compressing the heart pericardium leading to heart failure. Pericardiocentesis is challenging in patients with cardiac tamponade and severe pulmonary hypertension due to the risk of catastrophic haemodynamic collapse. An 18-year-old female who was recently diagnosed to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, and fatigue. The physical examination revealed tachycardia, muffled heart sounds, and distended jugular venous pulse. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and transthoracic echocardiography showed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade. There was severe pulmonary hypertension along with a dilated right ventricle with systolic dysfunction. The right ventricular systolic pressure was around 100 mmHg. The multidisciplinary team of cardiologists and pulmonologists decided to avoid pericardiocentesis due to the high risk of haemodynamic collapse. Aggressive medical therapy targeting pulmonary hypertension and SLE was started, which resulted in complete resolution of the pericardial effusion and normalization of pulmonary artery pressure. A conservative approach can be an alternative strategy to manage patients with large pericardial effusion and impending pericardial tamponade in the presence of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension as pericardiocentesis carries a high risk of haemodynamic collapse."

    "abstract": "Ischemic and/or infarction events of the alimentary canal are uncommon but potentially disastrous injuries of the digestive system that often portend a poor prognosis. Alimentary ischemia occurs when the vascular supply to one of the component conduit organs is disrupted or blocked, resulting in decreased tissue perfusion, subsequent necrosis, perforation, and even death if proper perfusion is not restored. We report a case here of a 67-year-old female who originally presented to the emergency department (ED) with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and progressively worsening abdominal pain. Conservative therapies that were initially employed failed to provide lasting symptom relief, and the patient was admitted for a more in-depth diagnostic workup and closer monitoring. During subsequent days of her resulting hospital stay, the patient had a positive result for Salmonella spp. on a stool PCR assay, an increasing leukocytosis, and the presence of several other worrisome laboratory abnormalities. Despite appropriate antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation efforts, the patient's abdominal pain and laboratory profile continued to progressively worsen. At one point, the patient's condition perilously worsened, necessitating an emergent exploratory laparotomy. During the course of this surgery and subsequent surgeries, the patient was found to have multiple areas of infarction present including at her esophagus, stomach, duodenum, proximal jejunum, and right colon. Additionally, evidence of a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of gastrointestinal (GI) origin was also incidentally found. Several subsequent surgical operations were required to repair the extensive tissue damage that the patient had sustained, and the patient's resulting hospital stay was complicated repeatedly by several different secondary infections and surgical complications. Attempts to determine the underlying cause for the ischemic events this patient experienced failed to yield definitive results, and no evidence for any arterial insufficiency or emboli was ever discovered. Despite this, a review of the histopathologic and laboratory findings from the tissue resected from the patient did find information to suggest that a relatively localized but severe venous thrombotic process likely occurred in the patient's alimentary vasculature that directly led to her presentation. Venous thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels and in the other vascular planes of the alimentary canal is often insidious in its presentation and poses a unique diagnostic challenge to clinicians. This case is significant because it illustrates the diagnostic complexity and difficulty imposed by mesenteric ischemia, especially cases resulting from mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) due to their often more indolent and atypical presentation. In short, a high level of clinical suspicion and familiarity with this ailment and its risk factors should be maintained because, in the absence of timely intervention, significant morbidity and/or mortality are likely to result."

    "abstract": "Background Blunt chest trauma is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt assessment for potential surgical intervention. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest has emerged as a valuable tool due to its heightened sensitivity and specificity in detecting thoracic injuries compared to conventional chest radiography. Objective This study aims to assess the impact of non-contrast CT chest findings on surgical decision-making and compare these findings with those from chest radiographs. Methods The study was conducted at the Accident and Emergency Department of Medical Teaching Institute, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Patients of all ages and genders who presented with blunt chest trauma were included. Non-contrast CT chest scans were used as an initial screening tool and compared with traditional chest radiographs. Data collected included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, diagnostic findings, and treatment decisions. Imaging was performed using a GE Optima 16-slice scanner (Medsystems Sp. z o.o., Lublin, Poland). Results The study included 246 patients, of whom 210 (85.4%) were males. The most common age group was 50 years or older, comprising 71 (28.9%) of the sample. The predominant mechanism of trauma was road traffic accidents, reported by 188 (76.4%) patients. Hemopneumothorax was detected in 121 (49.2%) patients on CT scans compared to 34 (13.8%) patients on chest radiographs. On chest radiograph, the pneumothorax component was missed in 43 (17.5%) patients, and the hemothorax component was not detected in 21 (8.5%) patients. Patient management included conservative management in 30 (12.2%) cases and surgical intervention in the form of unilateral tube thoracostomy in 173 (70.3%) patients or bilateral tube thoracostomy in 43 (17.5%) patients. Conclusion Our study supports the use of non-contrast CT scans as a reliable diagnostic tool for blunt chest trauma, consistent with current literature. This approach facilitates prompt management decisions, particularly for initiating tube thoracostomy based on findings of pneumothorax and hemothorax. The rarity of mediastinal great vessel trauma further justifies minimizing routine contrast use, thereby enhancing the efficiency of trauma evaluations."

    "abstract": "A small bowel obstruction (SBO) involves partial or complete blockage of the small intestine. Complete high-grade or closed-loop obstructions constitute acute surgical emergencies necessitating urgent intervention to prevent severe complications. Several probable etiologies of SBO have been identified, including malignancy, stool impaction, and inflammatory bowel disease; however, post-surgical adhesion is the most prevalent cause in the developed world. A SBO can be diagnosed clinically after a physical examination, but imaging is needed for surgical assessment and management. Misdiagnosis and inadequate management of SBO can cause several complications, such as intestinal necrosis and perforation. Therefore, when required, rapid diagnosis and surgical intervention are critical to avoiding mortality. Computer tomography (CT) and small bowel follow-through (SBFT) are widely utilized imaging modalities for confirmatory diagnosis of SBO. This case series features three patients who had exploratory laparotomies following extensive clinical evaluations and a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of SBO. All three cases involved numerous surgeries. The patients presented with severe abdominal discomfort and received surgical intervention after a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis and conservative therapy failed. In this case, all patients had different presentations but responded adequately to the same treatment modalities with no postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Leukocytosis and thrombocytosis often follow splenectomy in blunt trauma patients, complicating the postoperative identification of infection. While the platelet count to white blood cell ratio provides diagnostic assistance to discern between expected laboratory alterations and infection, diagnoses such as leukemia are often overlooked. A 53-year-old Hispanic male presented with abdominal pain, nausea, tachycardia, and focal peritonitis 4 days after being assaulted and struck multiple times in the abdomen. Initial white blood cell count was 38.4 × 109/L, platelet count was 691 × 109/L, and lipase was 55 U/L. Computed tomography abdomen/pelvis demonstrated a hematoma encasing the distal pancreas and abutting the stomach and colon. Emergent laparotomy revealed a nearly transected pancreas and devascularized colon, necessitating a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and colonic resection with primary anastomosis. Postoperatively, he had a persistently elevated leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, segmented neutrophils, eosinophilia, and basophilia (peak at 70, 2293, 64, 1.1, and 1.2 × 109/L, respectively). Despite sepsis workup, including repeat computed tomography, no source was identified. Hematology/oncology was consulted for concern for hematologic etiology, with genetic testing and bone marrow biopsy performed. The diagnosis of breakpoint cluster-Abelson gene-positive chronic myeloid leukemia was made based on genetic tests, including polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, which confirmed the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Bone marrow biopsy suggested a chronic phase. The patient was treated with hydroxyurea and transitioned to imatinib. Thrombocytosis following splenectomy is a common complication and a plate count to white blood cell count ratio  < 20 indicates infectious etiology. A significantly elevated white blood cell count (> 50 × 109/L) and thrombocytosis (> 2000 × 109/L) may suggest something more ominous, including chronic myeloid leukemia , particularly when elevated granulocyte counts are present. Chronic myeloid leukemia workup includes peripheral smear, bone marrow aspiration, and determination of Philadelphia chromosome. Post-splenectomy vaccines are still indicated within 14 days; however, the timing of immunization with cancer treatment must be considered. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the first-line therapy and benefits of pretreatment with hydroxyurea for cytoreduction remain under investigation. Additionally, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with gastrointestinal perforation and impaired wound healing, necessitating heightened attention in patients with a new bowel anastomosis."

    "title": "Traumatic Aortic Disruption Index is Associated with Mortality and Urgency of Stent Grafting in Blunt Thoracic Aortic (Grade 3) Injuries.",
    "abstract": "Delayed stent grafting for blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs) is current standard of care. However, given the heterogeneity of pseudoaneurysm presentations, it is currently unclear which severe BTAIs require more urgent intervention. We hypothesize that a Traumatic Aortic Disruption Index (TADI) calculation based on sagittal computed tomography angiography imaging measurements would correlate with urgency of stent grafting. All patients at a level-1 trauma center with BTAIs over a 12-year period were identified. A TADI score was then calculated using the length of pseudoaneurysm (L), maximum width of pseudoaneurysm (W), and normal adjacent aortic diameter (NA). Patient presentation, injury characteristics, timing of stent grafting, and outcomes were then evaluated. Forty-two patients were diagnosed with BTAIs. Mean age was 37.6 years, with a median injury severity score (ISS) of 29. Overall mortality was 11.9%. TADI scores ranged from 3.6 to 158.6. Compared to patients with a TADI <28, patients with TADI >28 had similar median ISS scores (34 vs. 29, P = 0.16), and rates of both traumatic brain injury (TBI; 33.3% vs. 42.0%, P = 0.53) and nonaortic hemorrhage control procedures (44.4% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.3). TADI >28 patients had a lower initial mean systolic BP (98.5 vs. 121.9, P = 0.003), more severe hypotension (lowest systolic 77.0 vs. 91.2, P = 0.034), lower initial Glasgow Coma Scale (6 vs. 13, P = 0.039), higher mean admission lactate (4.6 vs. 3.3, P = 0.036), and higher overall mortality (23.8% vs. 0%, P = 0.048). Patients with TADI >28 received stent grafting at significantly shorter median time intervals from injury identification (median 4 hrs vs. 14 hrs, P = 0.001). Overall causes of mortality were aortic hemorrhage related (n = 3, 60%) and TBI (n = 2, 40%). This simple-to-calculate index is independently correlated with mortality and urgency of stent grafting in blunt trauma patients with similar ISS. Patients with TADI scores >28 were more likely to undergo urgent stent grafting, thereby suggesting a trend in practice patterns with higher scores representing injuries that should be considered for expedited operative management. The TADI score should be validated in a larger sample of blunt trauma patients as an injury prioritization tool in the multisystem injured patient."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions in a virgin abdomen is encountered very rarely. Its rarity may cause a delay in diagnosis that can lead to complications among which is sepsis and death. In contrast, On-time diagnosis constitutes one of many pillars of the best outcome for the patient. We present a case of a 46-year-old female exhibiting symptoms of small bowel obstruction that persisted for five days. Her previous surgical history was negative. Upon testing, we found a neutrophilic leukocytosis and an abdominal x-ray revealed dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels and no air under the diaphragm with an increased pulse rate and respiratory rate. An emergency exploratory laparotomy definitively identified congenital band adhesions as the root cause of the obstruction. Abdominal x-ray is the starting investigation in rural health facilities of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), but lacks the ability to detect complications such as strangulation and ischemia as can the multidetector Computed Tomography scan and the Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A non-resolving small bowel obstruction or the one associated with peritonitis or bowel ischemia should undergo a surgical intervention. A negative surgical history should not annihilate the suspicion of band adhesions in small bowel obstruction. Early diagnostic imaging is helpful. When this is not possible, a laparotomy should be done if clinically indicated. The patient had an uneventful recovery."

A chest X-ray obtained showed cardiomegaly with suggested central vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. Further imaging with computed tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis showed a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion. Patient later developed signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade, requiring urgent pericardiocentesis with removal of 1 L of sanguineous fluid. Up to today, only 6 cases of dysphagia due to pericardial effusion have been described.

We describe the surgical treatment of a right CAA that manifested as a compressive mass adjacent to the right atrium. A 60-year-old female patient presented with mid-sternal chest discomfort and a CT scan showing a 6.3cm x 5.5cm x 7cm mass along the anterior chest wall compressing the right atrium. Angiography revealed 95% proximal right coronary artery stenosis with contrast filling a giant CAA but no antegrade filling beyond the aneurysmal sac. While hospitalized, the patient experienced acute hypotension, and an urgent CT scan demonstrated interval bleeding into the pericardial sac with significant external compression of the right ventricular outflow. The patient was urgently taken to the operating room, where the right CAA was ligated at the neck and oversewn at the ostium. The patient developed a hemothorax on postoperative day 1 without a clear source of bleeding, but the remaining postoperative course was uneventful. Opportunities for surgery in patients with ruptured CAAs are rare due to the high pre-hospital mortality rate. Complex percutaneous coronary intervention is the preferred initial approach for asymptomatic CAAs, as was performed in this patient eight years prior. However, in the setting of acute tamponade, urgent operative intervention is the only viable management option. Aneurysmal rupture is an uncommon complication of CAAs that frequently leads to sudden death. This case demonstrates the successful management of an acutely ruptured CAA with urgent aneurysm ligation."

Delayed lead perforations are rare compared to acute and subacute lead perforations and are not as well-studied because patients are often asymptomatic and are not diagnosed. Here, we report the case of a 44-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea one-month status-post dual-chamber AICD. The patient demonstrated signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade, which was confirmed with a 2D echocardiogram and computed tomography (CT) scans. Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed under general anesthesia, which restored hemodynamic stability. The right ventricular lead was repositioned and a pericardial drain was placed.

This study compared the clinical outcomes of REBOA and resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) in patients with bleeding below the diaphragm. This retrospective cohort study included adult trauma patients who presented to the Trauma Quality Improvement Program between 2020 and 2021 and who underwent either REBOA or RT in the emergency department (ED). Patients with severe head and chest injuries, characterised by an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score greater than 3, were excluded. The clinical data of patients treated with REBOA and those treated with RT were compared, and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) was employed to identify prognostic factors associated with mortality. A total of 346 patients were enrolled: 138 (39.9 %) received REBOA, and 208 (60.1 %) received RT at the ED. Patients in the RT group underwent ED cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) more frequently (58.2 % vs. 23.2 %; p < 0.001) and had a higher mortality rate (87.0 % vs. 45.7 %; p < 0.001). Patients who died had lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (6 [4.5] vs. 11 [4.9]; p < 0.001), underwent more ED CPR (58.6 % vs. 9.8 %; p < 0.001), and received RT more frequently (74.2 % vs. 26.5 %, p < 0.001). The MLR revealed that the major prognostic factors for mortality were systolic blood pressure (odds ratio [OR] 0.988, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.978-0.998; p = 0.014), ED CPR (OR 11.111, 95 % CI 4.667-26.452; p < 0.001), abdominal injuries with an AIS score ≥ 4 (OR 4.694, 95 % CI 1.921-11.467; p = 0.001) and RT (OR 5.693, 95 % CI 2.690-12.050; p < 0.001). In cases of blunt trauma, prompt identification of the bleeding source is crucial. For patients with bleeding below the diaphragm, REBOA led to higher survival rates than did RT. However, it is important to consider the limitations of the database and the necessary exclusions from our analysis."

    "abstract": "Jejunal diverticulosis is a rare form of diverticulosis characterized by acquired pseudodiverticula in the small bowel. Although most cases are asymptomatic, the condition can present diagnostic challenges due to its atypical presentation. Complications such as perforation can lead to acute abdomen, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. We report a rare case of perforated jejunal diverticulitis in an 84-year-old female with a known history of diverticular disease. The patient presented to the emergency department with worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a focus of air adjacent to the mesentery, indicative of bowel perforation. An urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed, which identified a 4-cm perforated jejunal diverticulum. The affected segment of the small bowel was resected, followed by primary side-to-side jejunal anastomosis. The patient was discharged home in stable condition following uneventful postoperative recovery. This case highlights the importance of including jejunal diverticulosis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, particularly in elderly patients with a history of diverticular disease. Due to the nonspecific presentation, prompt imaging is crucial for diagnosis. Surgical intervention is often necessary in cases of perforation. Increased clinical awareness of this rare condition may help reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes."

In the event of migration, it may result in perforation, as shown in our unique case of pericardial perforation through the fundus. Beyond illustrating a rare condition, this case prompts us to engage in a debate about whether to retain or remove asymptomatic foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract. It is a 28-year-old male patient, a prisoner, with a history of recurrent foreign body ingestion leading to five previous interventions, presented a year ago to our emergency department after ingesting four metal rods. Despite recommendations, the patient refused the intervention. After 1 year, he presented to our emergency department for respiratory distress. On examination, he had tachycardia, cardiac auscultation revealed a high-pitched sound signing a pericardial knock and abdominal palpation revealed epigastric tenderness. An abdominal X-ray revealed the presence of metallic foreign bodies located in the gastric area. An electrocardiogram showed a low voltage. Given these findings, there was a strong suspicion of rod migration from the stomach to the thoracic cavity with a cardiac tamponade. An emergency CT scan revealed that the rod had pierced through the stomach and pericardium, causing pericardial effusion. The patient was promptly transported to the operating room to discover the tip of the rod out of the stomach and penetrating the left diaphragm and the pericardial layer.

    "abstract": "Collision tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are thought to be uncommon, with those of the colon being rare with very few cases reported in current literature. There are three proposed theories regarding the etiology of collision tumors currently, including the \"double primaries\", the \"biclonal malignant transformation\", and the \"tumor-to-tumor carcinogenesis\" theories. Prognosis of collision tumors remains unclear. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of a collision carcinoma involving the cecum and ileocecal valve and the first report of a collision carcinoma including both mucinous adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumor of the cecum and the ileocecal valve. The aim of this paper is to explore the history of collision tumors and associated nomenclature, defined diagnostic criteria, and proposed theories for etiology in addition to patient presentation, approach to diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis. We present the case of an 83-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with a 4-month history of cramping abdominal pain associated with nausea, emesis, and decreased appetite with associated weight loss. Diagnostic imaging demonstrated a bowel obstruction secondary to a mass in the cecum and she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with right hemicolectomy. She was found to have a collision carcinoma of the cecum and ileocecal valve containing both mucinous adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumor. Diagnosis was confirmed post-operatively with pathologic examination and immunohistochemical testing. Diagnosing collision tumors upon patient presentation is exceedingly difficult as the symptoms are often identical to other neoplasms of the GI tract and vary based on location of the tumor. It is thought that the true prevalence of collision tumors is underestimated due to history of changing nomenclature, unclear diagnostic criteria, unreported cases, and unrecognized cases. Furthermore, new advances in immunohistochemical evaluation have allowed for better characterization of these neoplasms. With clarification regarding nomenclature, diagnostic criteria and expanding awareness, it is our hope that this leads to an increase in reported cases, allowing for an expanded discussion and resulting growth of literature and further studies. Further knowledge regarding the pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis is needed."

Spontaneous splenic rupture is usually associated with hematologic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders, with infectious mononucleosis associated with Epstein-Barr virus being the most common cause worldwide. Spontaneous splenic rupture without underlying cause is thought to be exceedingly rare. In this article we present a case involving a true spontaneous splenic rupture. We present the case of a 73-year-old female with past medical history significant for hypothyroidism, hypertension, squamous cell carcinoma of the chest, and history of tobacco use who presented to the emergency department with acute onset of left-sided flank pain radiating to her shoulder beginning three days prior. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed an acute splenic injury concerning for rupture with contour obscured by blood products with associated mild to moderate hemoperitoneum. The decision was made to proceed with emergent exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy. Patient received her post splenectomy vaccinations. On follow-up appointment, patient was noted to be doing well. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of atraumatic splenic rupture, as delayed diagnosis and treatment is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Operative intervention including splenectomy remains the mainstay of treatment, in addition to appropriate resuscitation. Some authors have reported cases in which hemodynamically stable patients are able to be treated non-operatively, however, the long-term consequences are unknown. Atraumatic spontaneous splenic rupture is often low on the differential diagnoses due to its rarity. Unfortunately, it carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality, and thus timely diagnosis and intervention is imperative."

This multicenter retrospective study involved three of the largest academic medical centers in central Ethiopia. All patients who sustained an anterior abdominal stab injury and underwent exploratory laparotomy, regardless of the intraoperative findings, were included over the 3-year course of the study. Of the 117 patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy, 35 patients (29.9%) underwent nontherapeutic laparotomies. Three factors predicted therapeutic laparotomy: hollow viscus evisceration (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-28.64; P=0.032), localized and generalized peritonitis (AOR, 4.77; 95% CI, 1.90-11.93; P=0.001), and white blood cell count ≥11,500/mm3 (AOR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.002-7.650; P=0.049). The overall positive predictive value of the therapeutic predictors was 80.2%, while the negative predictive value of all predictor-negative patients was 58.1%. The predictors would have prevented 51.4% of the nontherapeutic laparotomies. Close to one-third of the patients had a nontherapeutic laparotomy. The clinical predictors of therapeutic laparotomy were shown to have a high positive predictive value despite a lower negative predictive value. Further prospective studies that involve all patients who sustain anterior abdominal stab injuries are needed to potentially improve on the negative predictive value of the predictors suggested by our study."

    "abstract": "Trauma to the neck can produce catastrophic results as neck houses plethora of vital structures and is relatively an unprotected anatomical territory. Blunt trauma to the neck, excluding cervical spine injuries, represents only 5% of all neck trauma, but can be very challenging to assess since its presentation is often delayed. Penetrating injuries, on the other hand, are more common, and even when they seem to be only superficial and minor, always need thorough investigation and observation. Primary stabilization of the patient followed by an extensive evaluation needs to be done in all cases of neck trauma. CECT neck and thorax along with fibreoptic laryngoscopy remain the main modalities of diagnosis following a neck trauma. The initial approach to any kind of neck injury, whether penetrating or blunt, is performed according current Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) or European Trauma Course (ETC) protocols, which both use the structured 'ABCD' approach. A motor vehicle accident (MVA) remains the most common cause of blunt neck injury, causing direct pressure to the anterior neck from the dashboard, steering wheel or airbag deployment. Direct pressure to the neck is transduced to the trachea and causes compression of the oesophagus against the cervical spine. Laryngotracheal trauma continues to be a rare entity and is the second most common cause of death in patients with head and neck trauma after intracranial injury. Only 0.5% of multiple trauma patients were reported to have injury to the airway at any level. Stabilize the airway first. Immediate surgical airway procedure can be necessary in less familiar circumstances and environments. If possible, define landmarks before the procedure. Defining anatomical zones is useful in penetrating injuries, although these do not guide diagnostic or therapeutic management completely. In unstable patients, elective surgical exploration is recommended instead of extensive diagnostic work-up. Unstable patients still need immediate exploration, whereas all stable patients will first be assessed with clinical examination and CT angiography and fibreoptic laryngoscopy. Thus the take home message is to consider all neck injuries an emergency and proceed with the diagnosis and management without delay."

As many hand infections arise from penetrating trauma, knowledge of the offending pathogen, location, and mode of spread allows the clinician to determine the appropriate intervention. Along with a thorough history and physical examination, patient factors such as age, occupation, medical comorbidities, and surgical history should be noted. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management allow for optimal recovery and outcomes. In this article, we describe the ongoing debate regarding the timing and influence of preoperative antibiotics on culture yield, timing of debridement for open fractures as it relates to infection risk, and strategies for obtaining adequate cultures to guide antibiotic therapy for complex infections such as periprosthetic joint and hardware infections. Given the changing epidemiological landscape and increased rates of antibiotic resistance, it is critical to promote antibiotic stewardship. We provide updated treatment recommendations and antibiotic profiles for the treatment of common hand infections. Finally, we discuss newer technologies such as next-generation sequencing and development of promising diagnostic and treatment strategies that will enhance the hand surgeon's ability to treat complex hand infections."

These situations demand rapid and prompt actions, often testing the skill of emergency physicians. Resuscitative hysterotomy (RH), a critical procedure in maternal cardiac arrest, requires technical expertise, coordination, and anatomical knowledge. The high cost of commercial trainers and complex existing models restricts accessibility. This resource introduces a low-cost anatomically accurate RH task trainer and assesses its effectiveness in improving skills and confidence among trainee emergency physicians. A 20-minute-long case scenario depicted the resuscitation of a pregnant trauma patient with tension pneumothorax and uterine rupture, culminating in maternal cardiac arrest necessitating RH. Residents performed RH on the task trainer under faculty guidance. Feedback followed the Pendleton model, and an online questionnaire gauged the residents' experiences. Thirty emergency medicine residents participated in the simulation. The questionnaire revealed positive responses, confirming the session's relevance and enhancement of clinical skills and confidence. Our results underscore the RH task trainer's critical role in improving residents' skills and confidence during obstetric trauma simulations. Its realism and effectiveness were notably well received. Future refinements aim to augment fidelity while preserving affordability and integrating regular reinforcement sessions. This innovative educational approach equips health care professionals to respond adeptly to rare and challenging obstetric emergencies, ultimately elevating outcomes for mothers and infants during critical situations."

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia(CDH) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by herniation of abdominal contents into thoracic cavity through a defect in diaphragm. While commonly diagnosed prenatally or in neonatal period, late-presenting CDH can occur and may mimic other thoracic emergencies such as tension pneumothorax, complicating diagnosis and management. A two-year old male black child from Ethiopia presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of acute respiratory distress. Initial clinical assessment and chest radiography suggested a diagnosis of tension pneumothorax due to the presence of significant mediastinal shift and apparent pleural air. Despite insertion of chest tube, the child's condition did not improve, raising suspicion of alternative diagnosis. Careful observation of initial chest x-ray and subsequent chest ultrasound revealed a left sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia with herniation of stomach and intestine into thoracic cavity compressing the left lung and causing mediastinal shift. After the diagnosis of CDH was confirmed, the child was stabilized and emergent surgical repair performed. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the child was discharged with no significant long-term complications. This case underscores the importance of considering CDH in the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory distress in a child. It highlights the diagnostic challenges and potential risks of emergency interventions based on initial misdiagnosis. Even if x -ray looks like typical of tension pneumothorax, it showed giant cystic air filled structure pushing the mediastinal structure to contralateral side with loss of left diaphragmatic outline which raised suspicion of congenital cystic lung mass or congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Advanced imaging and high index of suspicion are crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely management, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Consideration of alternative diagnosis when our initial intervention with insertion of chest tube fail to provide symptom improvement in suspected pneumothorax should raise suspicion of congenital diaphragmatic hernia like in our case."

Ectopic pregnancies occur in a small percentage of all pregnancies and are a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Abdominal ectopic pregnancy (AEP) is a rare and potentially fatal form of ectopic pregnancy where the implantation occurs in the abdominal cavity. We present the following case of a 23-year-old female who was transferred following an initial workup for abdominal pain and subsequently found to have an abdominal ectopic pregnancy at 37 weeks gestation. After transferring to our emergency department, the patient continued to have abdominal pain and her presenting FAST exam was positive for free fluid concerning for active hemorrhage and hematoma. Her clinical presentation was consistent with ruptured abdominal ectopic pregnancy, and she was taken to the operating room for emergent exploratory laparotomy and delivery. Her clinical course was complicated by adherent placenta and re-bleeding with significant hemoperitoneum requiring re-entry laparotomy and transfusion. We present the details of this case along with the diagnostic imaging and management of the rarely seen and life-threatening condition of secondary abdominal ectopic pregnancy (AEP)."

    "title": "A Prospective Observational Study to Assess the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and C-reactive Protein-to-Albumin Ratio (CAR) in Predicting Morbidity and Mortality Among Patients Undergoing Emergency Abdominal Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Background Emergency abdominal surgeries pose significant challenges, especially in the Indian population, due to comorbidities, delayed presentations, and limited resources. Accurately predicting morbidity and mortality is crucial for timely interventions and improved patient care. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) have shown potential as prognostic markers, balancing inflammation and nutritional status. Aim The study aims to evaluate the predictive efficacy of NLR and CAR with regard to postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, thereby contributing to better risk stratification and management strategies. Patients and methods A prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital in northern Karnataka from August 2022 to June 2024, involving 102 patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgeries. The sample size (71) was calculated using G*Power software, targeting a 95% power with a 5% significance level. The inclusion criterion was patients aged over 18 years undergoing emergency abdominal surgeries; those who were immunocompromised, on steroid therapy, having malignancies, undergoing radiotherapy, or having chronic liver diseases were excluded from the study. Patients coming into the surgical inpatient department (IPD) with an acute abdomen requiring emergency abdominal surgeries as an emergency were preoperatively assessed using complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and serum albumin tests. NLR and CAR were evaluated preoperatively and at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. The outcome measures included surgical site infection rates, hospital stay duration, and outcome in the form of recovery or death. SPSS version 20 was used for statistical analyses. Results The study included 102 patients whose mean age was 43.7 ± 18.9 years; 74 of the participants (72.5%) were male. The most common procedures were exploratory laparotomy (64 patients; 62.7%) and appendicectomy (32 patients; 31.4%). A significant increase in CAR levels was observed on postoperative days 1 and 2 compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Preoperative NLR ≥ 8 was significantly associated with higher mortality (65% vs. 50%, p < 0.01). Preoperative albumin > 3.2 g/dL was associated with better outcomes (recovery in 54 patients; 65.9%) compared to < 3.2 g/dL (15 patients; 75% mortality). This study showed that NLR and CAR are valuable predictors of postoperative outcomes, with CAR indicating the risk for surgical site infections (SSI) and NLR predicting mortality. Conclusion The preoperative NLR had a significant association with mortality among the patients. Hence the NLR can be a good marker for the worst outcome and CAR during the postoperative period can be considered as a marker to detect the risk of SSI. NLR and CAR are simple, inexpensive tests readily available from routine blood investigations. The utility of NLR and CAR as valuable prognostic markers in the perioperative assessment of patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery could enhance the prediction of patient outcomes and guide more effective management strategies to improve patient outcomes in high-risk emergency abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "Purulent pericarditis is an uncommon complication of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which commonly occurs in an immunocompromised state such as HIV and can lead to life-threatening complications such as cardiac tamponade and potentially death if untreated. Early identification, pericardiocentesis, and general measures such as antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications can be life-saving. The authors present a case of a 64-year-old male with HIV who presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of pericarditis. Chest imaging revealed multifocal airspace diseases and moderate pericardial effusion. He had worsening lactic acidosis, and bedside point-of-care ultrasound showed pericardial effusion with features suggestive of cardiac tamponade. His lactic acidosis improved with emergency pericardiocentesis. Blood and pericardial fluid cultures revealed Streptococcus pneumoniae. He was further treated with intravenous antibiotics, colchicine, and ibuprofen. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), it has not been cited as the leading cause of pericarditis or pericardial effusion. In immunocompromised patients, it is necessary to consider a broad differential diagnosis as an etiology of acute chest pain, as it may be challenging to differentiate pleuritic and pericarditic chest pain from clinical presentation only. Moreover, infectious etiology of acute pericarditis and pericardial effusion should be considered in this patient population, especially those with HIV. At the same time, it is crucial to promptly identify and treat cardiac tamponade to prevent further deterioration. This case provides insight into the diagnosis and management of CAP and its potential complication of purulent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade in immunocompromised patients."

    "abstract": "Malignancy is a rare etiology of splenic rupture, with most documented cases resulting from hematologic cancers. There have been very few reports of splenic rupture resulting from invasion or metastasis of adenocarcinoma and even fewer reports resulting from specifically pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In this case report, we outline the clinical course of a 60-year-old male with splenic rupture and hemoperitoneum following a ground level fall who was transferred to the Shock Trauma Center (STC) from a local emergency department. Outside of the ruptured spleen, no other traumatic injuries were found on examination or imaging. Due to the initial concern for traumatic etiology, exploratory laparotomy was performed with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. Postoperative pathology results revealed pancreatic adenocarcinoma with splenic invasion staged pT3N0. This report provides a novel example of splenic rupture in the background of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and further solidifies the importance of maintaining a broad differential in cases of seemingly innocuous trauma."

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed multiple well-circumscribed left lower quadrant mesenteric masses containing heterogeneous attenuation and macroscopic fat. Exploratory laparotomy performed following abdominal CT and subsequent CT-guided biopsy revealed two intra-abdominal masses. Histopathological evaluation was positive for desmin and caldesmon immunohistochemical stains, and negative for C-kit, consistent with benign leiomyomata.

    "abstract": "Managing blunt abdominal trauma in Behçet's disease poses challenges due to underlying vasculitis and potential vascular complications. This case report discusses a patient who suffered abdominal trauma following a vehicular accident. Initial management focused on stabilizing hemodynamics and assessing injuries using diagnostic imaging. Surgical intervention, including exploratory laparotomy, was necessary to address bleeding and evaluate abdominal injuries amidst collateral circulation and mesenteric hematoma. Surgical intervention was essential in this case, with exploratory laparotomy required to control bleeding and assess abdominal injuries. The presence of collateral circulation can obscure the visualization of bleeding sources and complicate the surgical approach. Moreover, mesenteric hematoma, a potential complication in such cases, further complicates the surgical management by potentially masking other injuries and contributing to increased risk of intra-abdominal complications. Postoperative care involves monitoring for complications related to trauma and Behçet's disease, emphasizing a multidisciplinary approach for optimal patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background: We have employed a conservative management approach, including intensive control of both blood pressure and heart rate, in patients with aortic intramural hematoma (AIMH) and retrograde thrombosed type A acute aortic dissection (RT-TAAAD), sharing common clinical and imaging characteristics. Methods: To evaluate the outcomes of our conservative management approach, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 98 patients diagnosed with AIMH or RT-TAAAD from January 2008 to March 2023. A conservative management approach was applied, except for those patients with an aortic diameter ≥ 55 mm, false lumen expansion, or cardiac tamponade, who underwent emergency aortic repair. Results: Besides 2 patients, who declined surgery and subsequently died from aortic rupture, 18 patients underwent urgent aortic surgery, while 78 did not. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the extrusion type of ulcer-like projections (ULPs) on admission and a maximum aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm on Day 1 as risk factors for acute aortic surgery. Among the 78 patients who were discharged, 9 (12%) underwent aortic surgery, while 69 (88%) did not, with a median follow-up of 44 months. The overall actuarial aortic surgery-free rates were 78% at 1 year and 72% at 5 years, respectively. A Cox proportional hazards analysis identified ULPs and an aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm at discharge as risk factors for late aortic surgery. Conclusions: The early and late outcomes of our conservative strategy for AIMH and RT-TAAAD demonstrate favorable surgery-free rates. The extrusion type of ULPs on admission and an aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm on Day 1 are predictors of acute aortic surgery, while ULPs and an aortic diameter ≥ 45 mm at discharge are predictors of late surgery."

We report a young male with polytrauma (head injury, haemothorax, femur fracture, Grade V splenic injury) who underwent a successful laparoscopic splenectomy on day 3 following the failure of conservative management of grade V blunt splenic injury involving the hilum. The utility of laparoscopy in the management of blunt trauma is controversial besides several series have shown acceptable outcomes for both solid organ and visceral injuries in experienced hands. Furthermore, there are several reports describing the utility of the laparoscopic approach for isolated splenic injuries in stable patients. The utility of the laparoscopic approach for this patient was successful without major challenges during the procedure. The key initial step was achieving complete hemostasis as early as possible."

This case report, presented in line with the SCARE criteria, highlights a case of obstructed Spigelian hernia. We present a 37-year-old male patient involved in a free fall from a coconut tree while harvesting fruits. A sharp branch injured the scrotum before he landed on the ground. Then he started presenting with abdominal pain, failure to pass stool, abdominal distention, and later on vomiting. Abdominopelvic CT-scan showed ventral hernia concealed at the right lower quadrant of the abdomen with proximal intestinal dilatation. Exploratory laparotomy was done along with Spigelian hernia repair. This case was atypical, lacking evidence-based guidelines on surgical treatment. Considering the emergency aspect of the case, we performed an exploratory laparotomy along with hernia repair. The scrotal wound was cleaned and left open. The postoperative follow-up was conclusive, as the patient recovered with the hernia tract having healed by fibrosis. Spigelian hernia can be caused by trauma and may be difficult to diagnose at first glance. The attention should be paid to a thorough clinical examination and adequate workup.

    "abstract": "Blunt trauma is a physical injury to a part of the body, mainly caused by road accidents, direct blows, attacks, sports injuries, and falls in elderly people. Spinal fractures are observed only in a small percentage of injured patients. Accordingly, the present study was conducted on collected data between 2018 and 2022 to determine the frequency of spinal fractures in blunt trauma in Iran while also considering the mechanism of injury as a secondary outcome of interest. In this retrospective study, blunt trauma patients with spinal fractures, regardless of age were included by the census sampling method. Data were obtained from the National Trauma Registry of Iran. Means and standard deviations were used for continuous variables, and the chi-square test was used to assess the relationship between the variables. Among 25,986 cases of all-cause trauma patients, 1,167 cases (4.5%) of blunt trauma and spinal fracture were included in the study. Gender, the severity of injury, and the cause of trauma showed a significant difference among different age groups (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found in the injury mechanisms across various spine regions (p < 0.05). The majority of patients (68.2%) had lumbar spinal fractures. Road traffic collisions were the most common cause of spinal cord injuries, accounting for 58.3% of cases, followed by falls (36.1%). The injury severity score was higher in younger patients (under 18 years old), with a mean of 4.4 ± 3.5, and in patients with cervical injuries. The majority of injuries occurred in the lumbar area (68.2%), followed by the thoracic area. Furthermore, notable variations existed in Emergency Room (ER) stay duration, overall hospitalization, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay duration, and injury severity levels, all influenced by the spinal regions (p < 0.05). Distinctively, ICU stay durations and ER stay duration showed significant differences, particularly in relation to injuries in the lumbar and thoracic regions (p < 0.05). According to the results of the present study, trauma is more severe, and cervical injuries are more common in young people, which is a critical finding that underscores the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the severity of trauma in this age group. Additionally, the majority of cervical injuries occurred in young people, which is a particularly concerning finding given the potential for long-term disability and impact on quality of life. Our findings suggest that strategies to reduce cervical injuries, such as speed control, seat belt use, and phone-free driving, are crucial interventions for mitigating the severity of trauma and promoting patient outcomes in young people."

    "abstract": "With the development of regionalised trauma networks, interhospital transfer of trauma patients is an inevitable component of the trauma system. However, unnecessary transfer is a common phenomenon, and it is not without risk and cost. A better understanding of secondary overtriage would enable emergency physicians to make better decisions about trauma transfers and allow guidelines to be developed to support this decision making. This study aimed to describe the pattern of secondary overtriage in Hong Kong and identify its associated factors. This was a retrospective review of 10-years of prospectively collected multi-center data from two trauma registries in the New Territories of Hong Kong (2013-2022). The primary outcome is secondary overtriage, which was defined as early discharge alive within 48 h, Injury Severity Score (ISS) <15, and no surgical operation done. Patient characteristics, physiology, anatomy and investigation variables were compared against secondary overtriage using univariate and multivariable analyses. During the study period, 3852 patients underwent interhospital transfer from a non-trauma center to a trauma center, and 809 (21 %) of the transfers were considered secondary overtriage. The secondary overtriage rate was higher in pediatric age groups at 34.8 % (97/279). Logistic regression analysis showed secondary overtriage to be associated with blunt trauma and an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of <3 for head or neck, thorax, abdomen and extremities. Interhospital transfer is an essential component of the trauma system. However, over one-fifth of the transfers were considered unnecessary in Hong Kong, and this could be considered to be an inefficient use of resources as well as cause inconvenience to patients and their families. We have identified related factors including blunt trauma, AIS <3 scores for head or neck, thorax, abdomen and extremities, and opportunities to establish and improve on transfer protocols. Further research should be aimed to safely reduce interhospital transfers in the future to improve the efficiency of the Hong Kong trauma system."

It primarily occurs in the lungs but can also rarely occur in other organs, in which case it is classified as extrapulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. It often accompanies tuberous sclerosis complex. This report concerns a case of uterine lymphangioleiomyomatosis with spontaneous uterine rupture in a young woman with tuberous sclerosis complex. A 27-year-old nulligravida patient presented to the emergency room with vaginal bleeding. She had a history of clinical diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Initially, abdominopelvic computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging suggested a hemorrhagic necrosis and rupture of degenerated uterine myoma. She underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. The right side of her normal-sized uterus were ruptured without any specific mass. Active bleeding and hematoma from the ruptured uterus and partially ruptured right ovary were noted. The procedure included total hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathological analysis confirmed lymphangioleiomyomatosis in the uterine serosa and myometrium. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis mainly occurs in women of reproductive age and worsens with estrogen. Early diagnosis and careful follow-up are necessary due to the risk of worsening gynecological symptoms or even uterine rupture during pregnancy. This case enhances our understanding of extrapulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis and highlights the importance of comprehensive evaluation in complex clinical scenarios."

Upon workup, a transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound demonstrated a heterotopic pregnancy with an estimated gestational age of seven weeks. The ultrasounds confirmed an intrauterine pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity and a fetal pole along with a right adnexal ectopic pregnancy with fetal cardiac activity and a fetal pole. Additionally, a right paratubal cyst was incidentally found. The patient subsequently underwent exploratory laparotomy with a right salpingectomy for the removal of the right tubal pregnancy and a right paratubal cyst.

This case underscores the approach to diagnose and manage an unintended visceral puncture during pericardiocentesis, which is a rare but life-threatening complication. A 41-year-old male presented with intermittent fever over 2 months and chest pain for 15 days. Echocardiography revealed a significant pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. In an emergency setting, percutaneous pericardiocentesis was attempted to drain the effusion. However, the pigtail inadvertently punctured a sizable liver abscess. Consequently, another pigtail was inserted into the pericardial cavity to successfully drain the effusion. Patient was discharged on Day 12 and is doing well at 6 months follow-up. A previously undiagnosed case of a ruptured amoebic liver abscess presented with the uncommon complication of cardiac tamponade, necessitating emergency pericardiocentesis, which inadvertently led to the cannulation of the liver abscess. This case underscores the significance of image-guided pericardiocentesis in minimizing procedural complications. This case also highlights the intricacies of addressing accidental visceral puncture during pericardiocentesis, specially involving the liver. It also underscores the need to consider the possibility of a ruptured amoebic liver abscess when anchovy sauce-like pus is drained from pericardial cavity, especially in high epidemiologically prevalent country like India."

It is commonly associated with chronic constipation, particularly in patients with neurogenic bowel disorders or prolonged opioid use. However, its occurrence in the context of chronic heroin use is rarely reported. We report the case of a 40-year-old male with a 5-year history of heroin abuse who presented with diffuse abdominal pain, vomiting, and cessation of gas and stool passage for 10 days. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with generalized tenderness, guarding, and a rectal examination confirmed fecal impaction. Computed tomography (CT) showed massive fecal impaction in the sigmoid colon with pneumoperitoneum, indicating perforation. The patient underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy, revealing two perforations in the sigmoid colon with extensive fecal peritonitis. A segmental resection of the sigmoid colon with colostomy was performed. Postoperatively, the patient required intensive care for septic shock but eventually recovered and was referred to an addiction treatment program. This case highlights the serious gastrointestinal complications associated with chronic opioid use, particularly heroin. The pathophysiology involves opioid-induced inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, leading to chronic constipation, fecaloma formation, and subsequent perforation. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are crucial in managing stercoral perforation, which carries a high mortality rate if delayed. This case underscores the importance of recognizing gastrointestinal risks in chronic opioid users, especially heroin, and the need for integrated care strategies to prevent severe complications like stercoral perforation."

CT examination showed free air in the peritoneal cavity and in the retroperitoneum and a focal contrast extravasation within the uterine fundus. The patient underwent urgent laparotomy that revealed triple bowel perforation (sigmoid colon, medium rectum, ileum) and a laceration of the posterior and anterior uterine wall at level of the cervix with no signs of active bleeding. The bullet was lodged above the peritoneal reflection, in the right pelvis, and it was removed, and handed over to the judicial authority. The perforated bowel segments were resected with Hartmann's procedure and ileal anastomosis. The uterine laceration was repaired. Although all the viscera and the structures along the trajectory can be harmed, pelvic gunshot wounds have the potential to inflict serious injury. Nongravid uterine traumas are a unique occurrence, and proper care requires an understanding of lesion grading.

Nurses who have been trained in procedures such as pericardiocentesis are empowered to use that training to perform procedures via online or, if necessary, offline medical direction. The Butterfly IQ+ devices are currently utilized. Pericardiocentesis can be a lifesaving procedure for pericardial tamponade. However, its use in relieving tamponade caused by thoracic aortic dissection remains controversial due to the possibility of worsening the dissection with restoration of more normal blood pressure. We report 2 cases of in-transport, ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis for 2 patients with tamponade caused by type A aortic dissection and discuss its use in this clinical situation."

    "title": "Evaluation of stabbing assault injuries in a tertiary emergency department: a retrospective observational study.",
    "abstract": "Approximately 458,000 victims were deceased from intentional violence in 2021. A stabbing assault causes 25% of homicides. The study aims to evaluate injury patterns, trauma scores, radiological findings, types of treatment, and outcomes of stab assault patients admitted to a tertiary emergency department (ED). This is a retrospective observational study of stabbing injury patients in the ED of Hacettepe University, Turkey. The sites and patterns of injury, radiological findings, treatment methods, consultations, and complications are acquired from the patient's files. Trauma scores and frequency of outcomes, such as the need for surgery, hospitalization, or mortality, were calculated for all patients. Among the 648 patients, 564 (87%) were male. The median age was 28 (interquartile range [IQR]:13). The commonly injured body parts were the extremities (75%), thorax (21.9%), and abdomen (16.9%). The median RTS was 7,84 (IQR:0), and the median ISS was 2 (IQR:3). The fluid was detected in 13 of 88 patients by FAST, solid organ injuries in 21 patients, and gastric and intestinal injuries in 11 patients by abdominal CT. One hundred sixty-one patients underwent moderate and major surgery. Complications developed in 13 patients. 74,4% of the patients (n = 482) were treated in ED and 21.8% (n = 141) of patients were hospitalized in wards, 2.3% (n = 15) in intensive care unit and 1.5% (n = 10) patients died. GCS, RTS, and probability of survival (Ps) were significantly lower, and ISS was significantly higher in deceased patients and patients who needed erythrocyte replacement. The majority of stab wounds were detected in extremities, but severe and lethal stabbing injuries were on the thorax and abdomen. In thoracoabdominal stabbing injuries, x-rays and FAST can be ineffective in detecting critical and fatal injuries. Therefore, thoracic and abdominal CT should be planned early to detect possible causes of death and make a timely and accurate diagnosis. Lower GCS, RTS, and Ps or higher ISS scores were related to the need for erythrocyte replacement."

    "abstract": "Empyema necessitans is a very rare and morbid complication of pleural empyema. It is defined as the extension of pleural infection to the chest wall and surrounding soft tissues. Our case highlights an unusual presentation of empyema necessitans in a 29-year-old man. The patient had no prior comorbidities and presented to the emergency department with a 15-day history of growing left unilateral chest pain and swelling. This was initially clinically misdiagnosed as a post-traumatic hematoma. Contrast-enhanced chest CT scan allowed a diagnosis and the ruling out of the main differentials, such as skeletal lesions extending to adjacent structures but also benign and malignant soft tissue masses. The treatment involved surgical drainage of the abscess. Microbiological analysis of the abscess content identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis as the causative pathogen. The patient was subsequently treated with antituberculous drugs, leading to a favorable clinical outcome. This case outlines the importance of an enhanced chest CT scan in making an early diagnosis, defining the extent of the disease, and discussing differentials, all of which are paramount to better results with fewer complications. Moreover, it highlights the fact that blunt trauma may facilitate the formation of a fistula when an underlying infection is present."

    "abstract": "Trichobezoars are uncommon gastrointestinal concretions that develop due to the accumulation of ingested hair, predominantly affecting young females with concurrent psychiatric conditions like trichotillomania and Trichophagia. These masses typically form in the stomach but may also protrude into the intestines, potentially leading to severe complications if not promptly identified and treated. The present case study outlines the clinical manifestation, diagnostic complexities, surgical intervention, and postoperative care of a 10-year-old female patient with a substantial gastric trichobezoar, underscoring the significance of considering this disorder in pediatric individuals with gastrointestinal manifestations and a psychiatric history. The research article details the case of a 10-year-old female patient with a multifaceted medical history, which includes attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic constipation, growth retardation, and a background of neonatal seizures. She was admitted to the emergency department presenting with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Notably, the patient displayed pica-like behaviors, specifically the ingestion of hair, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of a trichobezoar, a form of gastric obstruction resulting from the accumulation of ingested hair. Diagnostic imaging techniques, including abdominal X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan, confirmed the presence of a substantial trichobezoar within the stomach, necessitating surgical intervention via exploratory laparotomy for removal. The pathological examination of the excised mass revealed a considerable quantity of hair intermingled with fecal matter. Following the surgical procedure, the patient exhibited a positive recovery trajectory and was subsequently referred for psychiatric assessment and behavioral therapy to address the underlying issues associated with trichotillomania, with the objective of preventing future occurrences. This case underscores the critical need for the identification and management of behavioral concerns in pediatric patients exhibiting similar clinical presentations. The patient exhibited symptoms such as epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, in addition to a medical history of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and pica-like behaviors. Diagnostic imaging confirmed the presence of a large trichobezoar, leading to the necessity of an exploratory laparotomy for its surgical removal. This case highlights the crucial role of comprehensive clinical assessment and imaging in the diagnosis of trichobezoars, especially in children with behavioral concerns. Managing such cases typically involves a multidisciplinary approach that combines surgical procedures with psychiatric assessment and behavioral therapy to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. This case underscores the importance of considering trichobezoars in the list of potential diagnoses for pediatric patients exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in individuals with psychiatric or neurodevelopmental histories. Timely identification and management are crucial in averting serious complications linked to trichobezoars. The favorable surgical result in this particular patient underscores the significance of holistic care that attends to both the physical and psychological dimensions of the condition, ultimately enhancing the long-term outlook. Additional research is required to explore the relationship between underlying psychiatric conditions, particularly ADHD, and the formation of trichobezoars. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies need to be developed."

    "abstract": "Internal hernias are relatively uncommon occurrences in cases of mechanical bowel obstructions. They occur when the small bowel herniates through a recess or defect within the abdominal cavity. Herniation through a defect in the broad ligament is particularly rare among internal herniations. We present the case of an 88-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a history of abdominal pain and obstipation. The patient had undergone open tubectomy 43 years ago. Erect abdominal radiograph and contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed the presence of intestinal obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a viable small intestinal loop herniating through a defect in the right broad ligament. The herniated bowel loop was reduced, and the defect was closed. The contralateral side was examined to confirm the absence of defects in the left broad ligament. Early diagnosis of internal hernia through broad ligament defect requires a high index of suspicion, and the advent of computed tomography has facilitated early preoperative diagnosis. Rapid management is necessary to prevent catastrophic sequelae such as strangulation and gangrenous changes in the herniated bowel."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is a common procedure for managing multi-vessel coronary artery disease to revascularize the myocardium. Among the various conduits used, the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) is preferred due to its better long-term patency rate. However, CABG procedures involving LIMA may result in rare but serious complications, such as avulsion of the LIMA post-CABG, which leads to disruption of blood flow to the myocardium and the development of fatal cardiac tamponade. We hereby present a unique case of spontaneous avulsion of a LIMA graft to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) away from the site of anastomosis, twenty-four hours following CABG surgery in a 67-year-old male patient. Emergency re-exploration and repair of the LIMA with interposition vein graft were performed and resulted in successful stabilization of the patient's critical condition. However, this was followed by a complicated recovery period involving atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and wound infection. Avulsion of LIMA graft following CABG is rare, yet a fatal complication that requires high clinical suspicion and prompt management. Avulsion has been reported a few times in literature following both minimal invasive and conventional CABG. Understanding the etiology, clinical presentation, and management of this complication is crucial to avoid catastrophic outcomes."

    "abstract": "Postoperative pancreatic fistula, a significant complication following pancreaticoduodenectomy, can lead to the development of pseudoaneurysms, which in turn can result in hemorrhagic and septic complications. Here, we present the case of a 67-year-old male patient diagnosed with pancreatic head carcinoma who underwent partial pancreatectomy. Ten days postsurgery, the patient experienced hemorrhagic shock due to intraperitoneal bleeding. Emergency exploratory laparotomy and implantation of a stent in the common hepatic artery successfully stopped the bleeding. However, the patient later developed gastrointestinal bleeding, and no apparent source was detected during endoscopic examination. Two complex transcatheter arterial embolization procedures were performed, successfully stopping the bleeding. It is crucial to consider pseudoaneurysm in cases of suspected biliary and pancreatic leakage. This case also underscores the importance of a thorough vascular assessment prior to placing a coated stent, to prevent postoperative obstruction of catheter access to the responsible vessel. Additionally, embolization via the external path of the stent proved feasible."

    "abstract": "Complications after percutaneous breast biopsy are infrequent but may include hematoma, pseudoaneurysm formation, persistent pain, infection, delayed wound healing, vasovagal reaction, hemothorax, pneumothorax, and neoplastic seeding. The risk factors include tumor factors (size, location, vascularity), procedure-related factors (needle diameter, number of biopsies), and interventionist experience. There has been no previous report of a fatal complication resulting from percutaneous breast biopsy. We report a 54-year-old Asian woman with a 3 cm BI-RADS® 4B left breast mass in the lower-inner quadrant who was biopsied by a 16 G needle under ultrasound guidance at a province hospital. She experienced dizziness and near-syncope afterward. The initial evaluation showed evidence of cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic instability. She underwent urgent subxiphoid pericardial window and was transferred to our facility. We brought her directly to the operating room to perform an explorative median sternotomy and found a 0.2 cm hole in the right ventricle. The injured site was successfully repaired without cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated mild right ventricular dysfunction without evidence of septal or valvular injury. She survived with no significant complications. This case might be the first report of a life-threatening complication related to percutaneous breast core-needle biopsy. The rapid pericardial release is key to the survival of cardiac tamponade. The patient subsequently required cardiac repair and monitoring to avoid long-term complications. In this report, we suggested a safe biopsy method, complications recognition, and appropriate management of penetrating cardiac injury. Penetrating cardiac injury resulting from percutaneous breast biopsy is extremely rare but can occur. A biopsy must be done cautiously, and worst-case management should promptly be considered."

The authors report a 38-year-old female admitted for a hemorrhagic shock. She was 10 weeks pregnant. The suspicion of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy arose based on amenorrhea accompanied by abdominal pain and a pelvic ultrasound showing an empty uterus and abundant free fluid in the abdomen. Emergent exploratory laparotomy was indicated by hemodynamic instability, revealing a ruptured left interstitial ectopic pregnancy. The use of three-dimensional ultrasonographic imaging specially in the first trimester improves the rate for early detection. The medical or surgical management of an interstitial pregnancy depends on the patient's hemodynamic stability considering the rupture of the pregnancy. Interstitial pregnancy is linked to elevated morbidity. Early diagnosis and adequate management both can avoid its catastrophic outcomes."

    "abstract": "Volvulus of the large bowel is a pathological condition characterized by the twisting of the colon around itself, resulting in obstruction and potentially severe complications such as bowel ischemia and necrosis. The objective of this case report is to highlight the importance of considering volvulus as a differential diagnosis in patients with a history of colonic surgeries, particularly when presenting with symptoms indicative of bowel obstruction. The case was a 55 years old male patient who underwent Hartman procedure three years back for an indication of gangrenous sigmoid volvulus. Three months later the colostomy was reversed and descending colo-rectal end-to-end anastomosis was performed. He currently presented to the emergency department with a one day history of abdominal distension which was progressive and associated with colicky persistent abdominal pain. Exploratory laparotomy was done which showed the descending colon was massively dilated and twisted 360 degree in the counterclockwise direction. The patient was discharged from the ward after one week stay. Despite of the fact that volvulus is the third most common cause of bowel obstruction, consecutive bowel obstruction secondary to volvulus at a separate time and site is an extremely rare phenomenon. A metachronous colonic volvulus is an extremely rare clinical entity. In a patient who presents with bowel obstruction with a history of prior sigmoid colectomy. it is important to consider metachronous volvulus as differential diagnosis specially in patients with significant risk factors or residing in a geographic area known with high rates of volvulus."

    "abstract": "The escalating adoption of laparoscopic surgical techniques has demonstrated their capacity to yield improved clinical outcomes. However, concomitant with the advantages of this minimally invasive approach, certain adverse complications have been reported. In this report, we present a noteworthy case involving a 72-year-old male patient who underwent laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. The surgical procedure proceeded without noteworthy complications, and the patient maintained hemodynamic stability throughout. However, the post-anesthetic recovery was compromised by the onset of subcutaneous emphysema and bilateral tension pneumothorax. Immediate intervention was imperative, prompting the performance of an emergent needle thoracostomy, subsequently followed by the implementation of a closed drainage system within the thoracic cavity. These interventions proved efficacious in mitigating the patient's distressing symptoms. Although pneumothorax complications in the context of laparoscopic surgery are infrequent, it is imperative for anesthetists to remain vigilant regarding the potential occurrence of subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax in the perioperative period. This case underscores the significance of meticulous perioperative monitoring and rapid intervention, particularly in laparoscopic procedures, where the insufflation of carbon dioxide into the abdominal cavity can predispose patients to these rare yet potentially life-threatening complications. Heightened awareness among healthcare providers regarding the possibility of such events is pivotal in ensuring the safety and well-being of surgical patients."

Together with the possibility of no symptoms or nonspecific ones such as cervical pain, hematoma, swelling, or mass, considering ICA pseudoaneurysm following a dog attack is of paramount importance to avoid life-threatening complications. We present a rare case of a 17-year-old male with a history of dog bites three months prior, who presented to the emergency department with left-sided neck pain, dizziness, and several episodes of blurred vision and diplopia. On physical examination, a palpable mass measuring approximately 20 × 30 millimeters was identified in the left neck region and multiple superficial lacerations were observed in this area. Laboratory tests yielded normal results. Doppler ultrasound revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the left internal carotid artery. Because the great saphenous veins were insufficient, the patient was successfully treated with synthetic graft patch arterioplasty, and no complications were seen in his one-year follow-up with computed tomography (CT) angiography.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Cardiac arrests are traditionally classified according to the setting in which they occur, including out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). However, cardiac arrests that occur in the emergency department (EDCA) could constitute a third category, due to the peculiar characteristics of the emergency department (ED). In recent years, the need to study EDCAs separately from other intra-hospital events has emerged. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of patients experiencing EDCA in an Italian hospital over a 14-year period. Methods: This was a single-centre retrospective observational study conducted in the ED of the Santa Croce e Carle Hospital in Cuneo, Italy. All adult patients who experienced EDCA between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2023 were included. OHCA patients, those arriving in the ED with on-going resuscitation measures, patients with EDCA not undergoing resuscitation, and patients with post-traumatic cardiac arrest were excluded from the study. The main outcome of the study was survival at hospital discharge with a favourable neurological outcome. Results: 350 cases of EDCA were included. The median age was 78 (63-85) years, and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 5 (3-6). A total of 35 patients (10%) survived to hospital discharge with a cerebral performance category (CPC) Score of 1-2; survival in the ED was 28.3%. The causes of cardiac arrests were identified in 212 cases (60.6%) and included coronary thrombosis (35%), hypoxia (22%), hypovolemia (17%), pulmonary embolism (11%), metabolic (8%), cardiac tamponade (4%), toxins (2%) and hypothermia (1%). Variables associated with survival with a favourable neurological outcome were young age, a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, coronary thrombosis as the primary EDCA cause, and shockable presenting rhythm; however, only the latter was associated with the outcome in a multivariate age-weighted model. Conclusions: In a cohort of patients with EDCA over a period of more than a decade, the most frequent cause identified was coronary thrombosis; 10% of patients survived with a good neurological status, and the only factor associated with the best prognosis was presenting a shockable rhythm. EDCA should be considered an independent category in order to fully understand its characteristics and outcomes."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a rare complication of hypothyroidism. In rarer cases, hypothyroidism may initially present with tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is an emergency condition that usually requires urgent intervention. However, guidelines for tamponade secondary to hypothyroidism are not optimal, and cases have been managed variably (ranging from levothyroxine alone to pericardiocentesis followed by thyroid hormone replacement) with diverse outcomes. Here, we report a case of a 42-year-old male with no medical history who presented with exertional dyspnea, lower leg swelling, facial puffiness, constipation, and weight gain. He had low blood pressure (80/60 mm Hg), normal heart rate with sinus rhythm, normal oxygen saturation, and was afebrile. Apart from a mildly raised creatinine, his test results were normal. An echocardiogram revealed features of tamponade. Further laboratory tests showed severe hypothyroidism. Following the initiation of levothyroxine, he demonstrated significant improvement. Coronary angiography revealed 95% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending artery, treated with stenting. Serial echocardiograms showed regression of the pericardial effusion, stabilizing his condition without the need for invasive pericardiocentesis. This case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of hypothyroidism-related tamponade to prevent severe cardiac compromise. Hence, it may be necessary to consider hypothyroidism in the differential for patients with unexplained cardiac tamponade."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR) is a rare but potentially fatal condition. It is commonly linked to underlying conditions such as infections, neoplasms, or hematologic diseases. SSR can also occur in a healthy spleen without any associated pathology, termed idiopathic splenic rupture. Symptoms range from non-specific abdominal pain to hemodynamic instability, often requiring emergency splenectomy. Early recognition using CT is crucial for improving outcomes. A 32-year-old male presented with severe abdominal pain for 24 h. Examination showed stable hemodynamics but tenderness in the left upper quadrant. CT revealed a subcapsular hematoma and moderate hemoperitoneum, leading to a diagnosis of SSR. Initially managed conservatively, the patient developed hemorrhagic shock 24 h later, with hemoglobin decreasing to 6.2 g/dL. An exploratory laparotomy confirmed a superior pole splenic fracture with significant hemoperitoneum, necessitating a total splenectomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 with prophylactic vaccinations and lifelong penicillin. SSR in a normal spleen is extremely rare and poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The exact mechanisms are unclear, with theories including vascular anomalies, microtrauma, increased splenic pressure, and idiopathic factors. SSR symptoms are often non-specific, leading to misdiagnosis. Timely diagnosis using imaging, particularly contrast-enhanced CT, is essential. Management varies from conservative approaches to splenectomy, based on hemodynamic stability and splenic damage. Spontaneous rupture of a normal spleen is a critical condition requiring high clinical suspicion for timely diagnosis and management. Further research is needed to understand its pathophysiology and risk factors."

    "abstract": "This case report highlights a rare but significant complication of blunt trauma requiring preperitoneal packing and illustrates the intricate relationship between trauma surgery and urological emergencies. Testicular torsion is an acute urological emergency necessitating prompt surgical intervention to salvage testicular function. While commonly associated with intrinsic factors such as the \"bell-clapper\" deformity, extrinsic factors such as trauma and postoperative complications can also precipitate this condition. This case underscores the complexity of diagnosing and managing testicular torsion arising after surgical interventions for pelvic fractures, a scenario sparsely documented in medical literature. We present a 27-year-old male who sustained multiple injuries, including a pelvic fracture, from a motorcycle accident and subsequently underwent preperitoneal packing for significant pelvic hemorrhage. Five days post-operation, the patient developed acute right lower quadrant and unilateral testicular pain, leading to the diagnosis of testicular torsion via Doppler ultrasonography. An emergency bilateral orchiopexy was performed, revealing a 180° torsion of the right testis. This case illustrates the need for a heightened awareness of potential genitourinary complications following trauma surgery. The pathophysiological mechanisms possibly include increased intra-abdominal pressure and altered testicular mobility due to surgical interventions. The report emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary care in trauma settings to ensure comprehensive evaluation and management of patients, including the consideration of urological complications. Testicular torsion following preperitoneal packing for pelvic fractures represents a critical intersection between trauma surgery complications and urological emergencies, necessitating vigilant postoperative care and multidisciplinary collaboration for timely diagnosis and intervention. This case contributes to the broader understanding of postoperative complications, advocating for an integrated approach to patient care in high-energy trauma scenarios."

The correlation between the frequency of DVT and major surgical procedures has been demonstrated. However, few studies have been conducted on the relationship between emergency surgeries and the incidence of DVT. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of postoperative DVT in patients undergoing emergency laparotomies. Methods This prospective observational study was conducted over 18 months, from January 2021 to July 2022. Patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomies were included in this study. Duplex ultrasonography was done preoperatively to exclude patients with DVT. A serial duplex ultrasound was performed to detect DVT until the seventh postoperative day. All the clinicopathological and surgical information of patients relevant to this study was collected and analyzed. Results Out of 146 patients, one developed DVT in the postoperative period. The patient who experienced DVT had no other known risk factors; however, his age of 60 was a risk factor for DVT. So, the reported prevalence of DVT in our study population was just 0.68% of emergency exploratory laparotomy patients. Conclusion Our study reports DVT in only one case out of 146 patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy without routine pharmacological prophylaxis. We might, therefore, conclude that emergency exploratory laparotomy may be a separate risk factor for the emergence of DVT. More prospective studies with large sample sizes should be done to evaluate the prevalence of DVT in emergency exploratory laparotomies."

    "abstract": "Herein we describe a case of a 60-year-old white male from New York City who was admitted to hospital due to worsening dyspnea. He presented with an acute onset of fever, night sweats, and progressively worsening nonproductive cough and orthopnea over the preceding week. Electrocardiogram findings revealed atrial fibrillation. Manifesting signs of hypoperfusion, a trans-esophageal echocardiography was performed, which demonstrated the presence of a cardiac tamponade. An emergency pericardiocentesis was performed, draining 750 cc of serosanguinous content. Laboratory investigations depicted an inflammatory milieu marked by lymphocytic leukocytosis, cardiac function impairment, and remarkably elevated d-dimer and brain natriuretic peptide levels. Notably, high-sensitivity troponin T remained within normal limits. Comprehensive viral panel assays, including COVID-19, Influenza A + B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Hepatitis C, HIV, Cytomegalovirus, Coxsackie A + B, and Herpes Simplex Virus, returned negative results. Furthermore, antinuclear factor and rheumatoid factor titers were negative. Blood and fungal cultures, as well as assessments for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, yielded negative findings. On further history-taking, he reported that he had occupational exposure to rat droppings and urine two weeks ago. Serological analysis demonstrated positive hantavirus IgG and IgM antibodies. Supportive management was initiated. Consequently, the patient was discharged asymptomatic, without pericardial effusion. Evaluation after two weeks revealed no recurrence of symptoms."

    "title": "Lung Adenocarcinoma Presenting as Early Cardiac Tamponade: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer death in the USA and worldwide despite continued advances in lung cancer screening and treatment. Pericardial effusion (PerF) has been found in up to 50% of postmortem patients with cancer; lung and breast cancers are the most frequent malignancies. Furthermore, it is a sign of poor outcomes with fewer than 5 months of survival. Nevertheless, PErF with or without tamponade as a presentation of lung cancer is uncommon. We present a 72-year-old male without medical history who presented with 1 month of cough with white sputum and shortness of breath, progressively worsening, associated with weight loss (20 pounds). Further studies demonstrated early cardiac tamponade secondary to malignancy. Cardiac tamponade can arise secondarily from various etiologies and have different presentations depending on the cause. In general, it is a slowly developing and clinically silent disease process. Therefore, malignant PerFs can rarely present with hemodynamic instability and be the initial manifestation of an underlying malignancy. Our case review presents a rare case of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as early symptomatic cardiac tamponade and as an emergency. The results might be life-threatening if this presentation is not recognized and managed appropriately. Clinicians must be aware of such atypical presentations of thoracic malignancies to take action adequately."

    "title": "A Comprehensive Study on Ruptured Liver Abscess in a Tertiary Care Center.",
    "abstract": "Background Bacteria and parasites cause liver abscesses (LAs), with the unusual but fatal consequence of ruptured LA. Along with the clinical signs of icterus, right upper quadrant pain, and a history of loose stools, patients present with non-specific symptoms such as fever, nausea, and generalized weakness. Consistent findings include male sex prevalence and frequent alcohol consumption. Leukocytosis, abnormal liver function, and an increased international normalized ratio have been identified by biochemical analysis; however, these findings are not specific to a ruptured LA diagnosis, and imaging is necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis. Ultrasonography usually confirms the diagnosis, and computed tomography is required in certain situations. In confined ruptures, percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy is typically the initial treatment course. Generally reserved for non-responders or moribund patients with delayed presentation, an open surgical approach may involve simple draining of a ruptured abscess or ileocecal resection, or right hemicolectomy in cases of large bowel perforations, both of which increase patient morbidity. A definite guide to management is still missing in the literature. In this article, we have discussed and correlated with data the predictors of surgery and preoperative predictors of perforation. Materials and methods This retrospective study was performed at Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, between January 2022 and December 2023. The study included 115 patients diagnosed with ruptured LA by ultrasound. Medical records were analyzed, and various parameters of the illness, clinical features, hematological and biochemical profiles, ultrasound features, and therapeutic measures were noted and assessed. Results Of the 115 patients, 88% (n = 101) were male. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain (114 patients) and right upper abdominal tenderness (107 patients). Fifty-two patients were treated with percutaneous drainage, and 42 underwent laparotomy. Intercostal drainage (ICD) tubes were placed in 19 patients. Sixteen patients had large bowel perforations. Twenty-three patients died (20%), including 17 patients who underwent laparotomy and nine patients who had large bowel perforation (39.1% associated with overall mortality, 52.9% associated with mortality in laparotomy). One patient with percutaneous drainage and a right ICD tube died in the intensive care unit. Four patients died before intervention. Significant associations were noted between perforation and mortality in patients who underwent surgical drainage. Loose motions, alcohol and smoking consumption, and deranged creatinine and albumin levels were found to have a significant association with surgical drainage. Conclusion The study found that a ruptured liver abscess (LA) may require surgery to drain the collection or repair the pathological bowel, which increases the morbidity, but it is a lifesaving procedure over percutaneous catheter drainage. The study also identified factors associated with a higher risk of death, such as a history of loose stools and low blood albumin levels."

    "abstract": "Emergency resuscitative thoracotomy (ERT) is a final salvage procedure for critically injured trauma patients. Given its low success rate and ambiguous indications, its use in blunt trauma scenarios remains highly debated. Consequently, our study seeks to ascertain the overall survival rate of ERT in blunt trauma patients and determine which patients would benefit most from this procedure. A retrospective case-control study was conducted for this research. Blunt trauma patients who underwent ERT between January 2020 and December 2023 in our trauma center were selected for analysis, with the endpoint outcome being in-hospital survival, divided into survival and non-survival groups. Inter-group comparisons were conducted using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, the Kruskal-Wallis test, Student's t-test, or the Mann-Whitney U test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess potential predictors of survival. Then, the efficacy of the predictors was assessed through sensitivity and specificity analysis. A total of 33 patients were included in the study, with 4 survivors (12.12%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a significant association between cardiac tamponade and survival, with an adjusted odds ratio of 33.4 (95% CI: 1.31 - 850.00, p = 0.034). Additionally, an analysis of sensitivity and specificity, targeting cardiac tamponade as an indicator for survivor identification, showed a sensitivity rate of 75.0% and a specificity rate of 96.6%. The survival rate among blunt trauma patients undergoing ERT exceeds traditional expectations, suggesting that select individuals with blunt trauma can significantly benefit from the procedure. Notably, those presenting with cardiac tamponade are identified as the subgroup most likely to derive substantial benefits from ERT."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic tuberculosis (TB) is extremely rare and has similar clinical and radiological findings compared to pancreatic malignancy. Challenges in detecting individuals with pancreatic TB, especially in rural areas with limited supporting resources, are the reasons for a more complete care strategy. We report a case of pancreatic TB in a 25-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department (ED), who was initially suspected of having a pancreatic tumor. Her chief complaints were fever, fatigue, and abdominal pain, while she also experienced weight loss. Exploratory laparotomy and further pathological evaluation suggested pancreatic TB. Subsequently, the patient was given anti-TB drugs and showed clinical improvement. In conclusion, this case report highlighted that pancreatic TB could mimic pancreatic cancer; however, it is a treatable condition. Thus, it is important for physicians to consider this as a differential diagnosis, especially in high-risk populations and in rural areas with limited diagnostic tools."

Echocardiograms, CT scans, and MRIs are the standard methods for finding sites of cardiac tumors; however, immunohistochemical confirmation is necessary for a definitive diagnosis of angiosarcoma. A 58-year-old male presented to the emergency room with one week of dyspnea on moderate exertion accompanied by chest pain and alleviated with rest. A workup done to evaluate mass found a single 5 x 3.5 x 4.8 cm mass heavily vascularized by the right coronary artery and left circumflex involving the free wall of the right atrium with no extension to the tricuspid valve. Surgical resection was performed, and immunohistochemistry was consistent with a primary cardiac angiosarcoma. An exudative fluid analysis on pericardial and pleural fluid analysis may warrant screening for malignancy more frequently in concurrence with a patient's history and presentation. Although the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of cardiac angiosarcoma is not well established, further investigation of such correlation may offer insight into survival post-treatment."

This is a retrospective two-center study of adult patients with splenic injuries who underwent emergency TAE between January 2011 and December 2022. Patients were divided into two groups; hemodynamically unstable (HDU) and hemodynamically stable (HDS) patients. HDU patients were defined as transient- or non-responders to fluid resuscitation and HDS as responders. When immediate laparotomy was not possible for HDU patients, angiography and embolization were performed. The primary outcome was the survival discharge rate. Rebleeding and splenectomy rate was also investigated. Of 38 patients underwent emergency TAE for splenic trauma, 17 were HDU patients and 21 were HDS patients. The survival discharge rate was 88.2 % (15/17) in the HDU- and 100 % in HDS patients (p = 0.193). Rebleeding rate was 23.5 % (4/17) in HDU- and 5.0 % (1/21) in HDS patients (p = 0.15). Splenectomy was required for one HDU patient (5.9 %) for rebleeding. The survival discharge rate of TAE for splenic trauma in HDU patients was acceptable with a low rate of splenectomy. Further comparative studies of TAE versus operative management in HDU patients are needed to prove the usefulness of TAE."

The presentation of adrenal gland cysts is usually asymptomatic, but those cases in which symptoms are present are usually non-specific, which makes adrenal cysts generally recognized as incidentalomas. The finding is mainly made by computed tomography. The main objective of this article was to describe the clinical course of a patient with an adrenal gland pseudocyst, which is accompanied by symptoms of compression and persistent pain of long evolution in the left flank. A 65-year-old female patient attended the emergency room of a second-level hospital due to an increase in volume of the abdominal region with a sensation of fullness, heartburn, vomiting and pain. Computed tomography was performed, which reported a cystic mass and, later, exploratory laparotomy plus adrenalectomy were carried out. The pathology analysis reported a diagnosis of a 10 x 15 x 14 cm solid, cystic, and adherent tumor, coinciding with a pseudocyst of the adrenal gland. Adrenal gland cysts are rare. Computed tomography is recommended for its diagnosis and the standard of treatment is surgical intervention in the presence of symptoms. los quistes de glándula suprarrenal son una entidad rara, con un reporte en la incidencia de series post mortem de 0.06-0.18%.

    "abstract": "Anti-inflammatory effects of tranexamic acid (TXA) in reducing trauma endotheliopathy may protect from acute lung injury. Clinical data showing this benefit in trauma patients is lacking. We hypothesized that TXA administration mitigates pulmonary complications in penetrating trauma patients. This is a post-hoc analysis of a multicenter, prospective, observational study of adults (18+ years) with penetrating torso and/or proximal extremity injury presenting at 25 urban trauma centers. Tranexamic acid administration in the prehospital setting or within three hours of admission was examined. Participants were propensity matched to compare similarly injured patients. The primary outcome was development of pulmonary complication (ARDS and/or pneumonia). A total of 2382 patients were included, and 206 (8.6%) received TXA. Of the 206, 93 (45%) received TXA prehospital and 113 (55%) received it within three hours of hospital admission. Age, sex, and incidence of massive transfusion did not differ. The TXA group was more severely injured, more frequently presented in shock (SBP < 90 mmHg), developed more pulmonary complications, and had lower survival (P < 0.01 for all). After propensity matching, 410 patients remained (205 in each cohort) with no difference in age, sex, or rate of shock. On logistic regression, increased emergency department heart rate was associated with pulmonary complications. Tranexamic acid was not associated with different rate of pulmonary complications or survival on logistic regression. Survival was not different between the groups on logistic regression or propensity score-matched analysis. Tranexamic acid administration is not protective against pulmonary complications in penetrating trauma patients."

This nationwide registry analysis aimed to describe the French practice of ERT. From 2015 to 2021, all severe trauma patients who underwent ERT were extracted from the TraumaBase→ registry. Demographic data, prehospital management and in-hospital outcomes were recorded to evaluate predictors of success-to rescue after ERT at 24-hour and 28-day. Only 10/26 Trauma centers have an effective practice of ERT, three of them perform more than 1 ERT/year. Sixty-six patients (74% male, 49/66) with a median age of 37 y/o [26-51], mostly with blunt trauma (52%, 35/66) were managed with ERT. The median pre-hospital time was 64mins [45-89]. At admission, the median injury severity score was 35 [25-48], and 51% (16/30) of patients have lost SOL. ERT was associated with a massive transfusion protocol including 8 RBCs [6-13], 6 FFPs [4-10], and 0 PCs [0-1] in the first 6h. The overall success-to-rescue after ERT at 24-h and 28-d were 27% and 15%, respectively. In case of refractory shock after penetrating trauma, survival was 64% at 24-hours and 47% at 28-days.

Data was obtained from the trauma registry and chart review. Rates and timing of surgical intervention, initial injury severity measures, and general hospital outcomes were compared between firearm-related SCI and blunt trauma SCI. Patients with firearm-related SCI were less likely to undergo surgery compared to other etiologies (24.3% vs. 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Time to surgery for firearm-related SCI was longer than for other etiologies (49.2 ± 92.9 vs. 30.6 h ± 46.0, P = 0.012). Multiple measures of initial injury severity, including Injury Severity Score, Glasgow Coma Score, and emergency department disposition demonstrated more severe injury among patients with firearm-related SCI, and these patients often required other emergent surgeries prior to spine surgery (52%). There was a longer time to spine surgery among patients with firearm-related SCI compared to blunt trauma SCI, and patients with firearm-related SCI were more severely injured on initial presentation.

In less than 1% of the cases, pericardial rupture can coexist with a BTDR. A coexistence of BTDR and pericardial rupture can result in displacement of the heart and is associated with high mortality. Clinical presentation is non-specific and requires a high index of suspicion for early management. A 4-year-old child presented to the emergency unit of our hospital following high-energy trauma with severe respiratory distress. Initially, a left-side chest tube was inserted, but it resulted in no clinical improvement. A chest x-ray showed a collapse of the left lung with a herniation of bowel loops into the left hemithorax. An exploratory laparotomy was done, which revealed a 10 cm × 4 cm defect in the left hemidiaphragm with a medial extension involving the pericardium. The fundus of the stomach and left lobe of the liver were displaced into the pericardial space, pushing the cardiac apex posteriorly to the right side. Concomitantly, the transverse colon and small bowel were displaced into the left pleural space. After the reduction of the herniated abdominal viscera back into the peritoneal cavity, the pericardial sac was repaired by employing an interrupted resorbable suture, while the diaphragmatic defect was repaired by using a horizontal mattress. No other injuries were identified and the abdomen was closed in layers. BTDR with pericardial rupture is an elusive condition with a high mortality rate that necessitates a high index of clinical suspicion. Early surgical repair of the defect with a reduction of herniated organs can reduce morbidity and mortality."

It imitates clinical experience in a controlled and safe environment that closely resembles reality. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of HFS versus video-assisted lecture (VAL) based education in enhancing and consolidating retention of skills among undergraduate medical students. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) study involving 111 undergraduate medical students was conducted where the competency of skills was assessed by objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in the first, fourth and seventh/eighth weeks. A cohort of 12-14 students was enrolled for each session. The randomisation of the participants into control (VAL-based teaching) and intervention (HFS-based teaching) groups was achieved by implementing the computer-based random sequence generation method. VAL-based teaching module was a fully interactive face-to-face teaching session where a prerecorded video clip was used. The video clip detailed the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax in an acute medical emergency and its management by performing needle decompression on a high-fidelity patient simulator (METIman). HFS-based teaching module was delivered as a fully interactive hands-on training session conducted on the same METIman to demonstrate the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax in an acute medical emergency and its management by performing needle decompression. OSCE scores were compared as the denominator of learning (enhancement and retention of skills) between two groups who underwent training with either VAL-based or HFS-based teachings. The OSCE assessments were used to evaluate the participants' performance as a group. These scores were used to compare the enhancement and medium-term retention of skills between the groups. The outcome was measured with the mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total OSCE scores for skills assessments. We used General Linear Model two-way mixed ANOVA to ascertain the difference of OSCE marks over assessment time points between the control and the intervention groups. ANCOVA and two-way mixed ANOVA were used to calculate the effect size and the partial Eta squared. p value less than 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. The two-way mixed ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference in mean OSCE scores between intervention and control groups (p=0.890), although the mean score of the intervention group was better than the control group. Our study demonstrated that HFS was not significantly effective over VAL-based education in enhancing skills and consolidating retention among undergraduate medical students. Further research is needed to determine its suitability for inclusion in the course curriculum considering the cost-effectiveness of implementing HFS that may supplement traditional teaching methods."

The data of the patients who had been the victims of violence in 2020 were extracted from the Trauma Registry System(TRS) of the Guilan Road Trauma Research Center(GTRC). All analyses were performed using SPSS software version 24. The significance level was considered less than 0.05. There was a significant difference in the type of violence-related trauma in different age groups (P < 0.001), based on sex (P = 0.002), and marital status (P = 0.012). A significant difference also existed between the trauma type and clinical variables including smoking (P = 0.032), history of alcohol drinking (P = 0.005), and other substance use (P = 0.002), the anatomical location of injury (P < 0.001) and therapeutic interventions (p < 0.001(. Most of the clients of the violence suffered from blunt trauma, the severity of which was mild, and they were treated supportively without the need for surgery. Blunt trauma was seen more in women, divorcees, over 40 years and non-smokers. Penetrating trauma was observed more in lower limb injuries and alcohol and amphetamine users. Prevention programs and educational interventions should be programmed for the society long before men alcohol and amphetamine abusers reach their fourth decade of life. Accurately recording the type of physical violence, and the weapon used, and determining the injury severity score in TRS can lead to more reliable results in researching the field of violence issues."

Commotio cordis requires immediate medical attention through cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, often resulting in death. Commotio cordis is most common condition among young male athletes. The purpose of this study was to describe the incidents and patterns of commotio cordis among young athletes participating in organised sports in the USA from academic years 1982-1983 through 2022-2023. This was a retrospective, descriptive epidemiology study using surveillance data from the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research. The study included all commotio cordis incidents captured in the database. We calculated descriptive statistics (counts and proportions) overall and stratified by outcome and athlete sport. Over the study period, 64 incidents of commotio cordis were captured. The majority occurred among males (n=60) and were caused by contact with an object/apparatus (n=39) or contact with another player (n=20). The most common sports were baseball (n=20), lacrosse (n=17) and football (n=13). Over half of these incidents resulted in death (n=34), although survival from commotio cordis increased over the study period. A higher proportion of fatal incidents occurred among football athletes and were caused by contact with another player. Commotio cordis remains most common among young male athletes who participate in organised baseball, lacrosse and football. Although survival has improved over time, greater awareness and emergency preparedness for commotio cordis in an organised sport are needed to facilitate prompt recognition and intervention."

    "abstract": "As technology in mechanical circulatory support continues to advance, so does the utilization of durable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). We present the first reported case of HeartMate 3 (HM3) LVAD bend relief disconnection causing laceration of the outflow graft. Our patient is a 34 year old male with end-stage heart failure status post-HM3 implantation with recent debridement of a driveline infection who presented with weakness and sanguineous drainage 5 days after an episode of heavy lifting associated with a palpable substernal pop. During the initial evaluation, he experienced sudden massive decompression of a left chest hematoma through a thoracotomy incision with exsanguinating hemorrhage and an abrupt drop in LVAD flow. An emergent anterolateral thoracotomy was performed where it was discovered that the bend relief was disconnected and had lacerated the outflow graft. The graft was repaired and the ring was removed using a diamond blade rotary saw. He was discharged home and made a full recovery. Mechanical device malfunction has been documented in several prior versions of durable LVADS. Although there have been reported cases in the Heartmate 2, this is the first reported case of a HM3 bend relief disconnection and resultant laceration of the outflow graft."

    "abstract": "Sweden has an established trauma system involving national trauma criteria and the Swedish trauma registry (SweTrau), since over a decade. Meanwhile, the injury panorama has evolved, with an increase in gang-related violence in the Swedish community. In this study, we aimed to investigate long-term trends in mortality, management and trauma type in two major Swedish trauma centers over a nine-year period. All trauma patients with a New Injury Score (NISS) > 15 or a Trauma Alert (TA) call during 2013-2021 were identified in the participating centers' SweTrau registries. Data were analysed regarding mortality, proportion of emergency interventions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, mechanism of injury and type of trauma (penetrating or blunt). To assess trends, Chi-Squared test for trend and JoinPoint regression method were used. A total of 10,587 patients were included in the study. Mortality remained unchanged over time in patients with NISS > 15 (10.0-10.9%, p = 0.963) but increased in patients with a TA and NISS < 15 (1.3-2.7%, p = 0.005). For NISS > 15, the proportion undergoing emergency interventions was stable (53.9%-48.8%, p = 0.297) while ICU admissions declined (62.1%-45.7%, p < 0.001). Penetrating trauma increased (12.4-19.6%, p < 0.001), including knife (10.0-15.7%, p < 0.001) and gunshot wounds (2.3-3.8%, p < 0.001), whereas accidents involving motorcycles (8.8%-7.0%, p = 0.004) and pedestrians (5.3%-2.2%, p < 0.001) decreased. Assaults (both penetrating and blunt) increased from 14.7 to 21.4% (p < 0.001). In this trend analysis at two major Swedish trauma centers during 2013-2021, penetrating trauma increased with over 50% while traffic injuries decreased. The rise in mortality in patients with a TA and NISS < 15 is concerning and requires further evaluation, as do the reduction in ICU admissions."

    "abstract": "Penetrating thoracic trauma with retained foreign bodies, such as needles, is rare. These injuries present management challenges due to diverse aetiologies and potential complications, including tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and major haemorrhage. Cardiac penetration can result in arrhythmias, ischaemia, valvular and septal defects. Effective management depends on patient status, injury mechanism, and resources. A 2-year-old girl presented with left chest wall pain after falling. Examination revealed a small puncture wound and a rhythmic bulge at the left fifth intercostal space. She was stable, with normal vitals and no respiratory distress. Imaging, including chest X-ray and echocardiography, revealed a 40 mm needle in the left pleural space, contacting the pericardium near the left ventricular apex. She was transferred to a paediatric cardiothoracic centre, where a left anterolateral thoracotomy confirmed the needle's location and facilitated its removal. She recovered without complications. Retained foreign bodies in the heart can arise from various injuries and pose complications from asymptomatic to life-threatening. This case underscores the importance of early assessment, particularly in children where symptoms may be subtle. Essential imaging aids in diagnosis and surgical planning. The surgical approach was context-specific, favouring minimally invasive options when feasible. Trauma networks play a crucial role in improving outcomes by ensuring timely access to specialized care. This case highlights the importance of early assessment and intervention in paediatric patients with penetrating thoracic trauma involving foreign bodies. The successful outcome was due to prompt recognition, accurate imaging, and coordinated efforts within a specialized trauma network."

While SSR is extremely rare in patients with proven IM, it is the most lethal complication of the infection (9% mortality rate) and can present completely asymptomatically or with abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. As adolescents and young adults are the most affected population group, with this case report, we intend to raise the vigilance of any doctor treating those patients in the emergency department. We present the case of a 16-year-old patient with an atraumatic splenic rupture and hemoperitoneum secondary to an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, and a splenectomy was performed. This case demonstrates that, even if SSR in patients with IM is extremely rare, it should always be considered in a patient with a relevant clinical presentation."

The aim of this study was to identify trauma-related preventable death (TRPD) within our institute by an external expert panel and to evaluate inter-panel reliability. Trauma-related deaths between the 1st of January 2020 and the 1st of February 2022 at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre were identified. The severely injured patients (injury severity score ≥ 16) were enrolled for preventability analysis by an external multidisciplinary panel, consisting of a trauma surgeon, anaesthesiologist, emergency physician, neurosurgeon, and forensic physician. Case descriptions were provided, and panellists were asked to classify deaths as non-preventable, potentially preventable, and preventable. Agreements between the five observers were assessed by Fleiss kappa statistics. In total 95 trauma-related deaths were identified. Of which 36 fatalities were included for analysis, the mean age was 55.3 years (± 24.5), 69.4% were male and 88.9% suffered blunt trauma. The mean injury severity score was 35.3 (± 15.3). Interobserver agreement within the external panel was moderate for survivability (Fleiss kappa 0.474) but low for categorical preventable death classification (Fleiss kappa 0.298). Most of the disagreements were between non-preventable or potentially preventable with care that could have been improved. Multidisciplinary panel review has a moderate inter-observer agreement regarding survivability and low agreement regarding categorical preventable death classification. A valid definition and classification of TRPD is required to improve inter-observer agreement and quality of trauma care."

    "abstract": "High-energy, blunt force trauma to the abdomen results in an abdominal wall injury (AWI) in up to 9% of patients. In 1% of blunt abdominal trauma, they result in a traumatic abdominal wall hernia (TAWH). Optimal management of these injuries remains unclear. Because they are the result of a high-energy mechanism, concomitant serious abdominal organ injuries are common. This has prompted some to advocate that the presence of a TAWH on physical exam mandates exploratory laparotomy. However, delayed repairs have better outcomes and nontherapeutic celiotomy should be avoided. Similarly debated is the expanding use of minimally invasive techniques and the use of mesh for hernia repairs. Overall, the presence of a TAWH is likely not an absolute indication for emergency surgery. Rather, it is an indicator of high-energy impact and associated with a high rate of visceral injury. These patients require a close observation for clinical decline and development of typical indicators for laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction secondary to the use of fortified milk is a rare cause in pre-term patients. We present the case of a female pre-term newborn admitted as a result of abdominal distension and rectal bleeding, which mimicked necrotizing enterocolitis. On abdominal X-ray, she had an obstruction pattern, and on ultrasonography, echogenic masses at the distal ileum were observed. Given the lack of improvement with conservative management, urgent exploratory laparotomy was decided upon. At surgery, compact milk masses at the level of the distal ileum were identified as the cause of intestinal obstruction. Appendicostomy and lavage with saline solution through the ileocecal valve were performed. This allowed milk masses to come out towards the colon, and a great amount of acholic stools to be expelled. The increase in \"milk curd syndrome\" cases should lead us to consider this cause in the differential diagnosis of intestinal obstruction in pre-term newborns fed with fortified milk. La obstrucción intestinal secundaria al uso de leche fortificada es una causa infrecuente descrita en pacientes prematuros. Presentamos el caso de una recién nacida prematura que ingresa por distensión abdominal y rectorragia, simulando una enterocolitis necrotizante. En la radiografía abdominal presenta patrón obstructivo y en ecografía se identifican masas ecogénicas en íleon distal. Dada la no mejoría con manejo conservador, se decide laparotomía exploradora urgente. En la intervención se detectan masas compactas de leche a nivel de íleon distal como causa de la obstrucción intestinal. Se realiza apendicostomía y lavado con suero fisiológico a través de la válvula ileocecal, permitiendo salida de moldes hacia colon y expulsión de gran cantidad de heces acólicas.

Although typical clinical presentations of spontaneous ruptured HCC facilitate easy diagnosis, this condition can present with unexpectedly varied symptoms, making diagnosis challenging. We describe an atypical clinical presentation of spontaneous ruptured HCC mimicking an inguinal hernia. A 66-year-old man presented to the emergency department with groin discomfort and swelling, suggesting an inguinal hernia. He had no history of an inguinal hernia or known liver cirrhosis. Physical examination revealed a palpable, tender left groin mass. Point-of-care ultrasonography showed bowel-like structures with an echo-free space in the left groin. Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis demonstrated mesenteric fat prolapse and hyperdense fluid in the left inguinal canal and scrotum. Considering the possibility of a strangulated hernia, emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. Unexpectedly, blood retention in the hernia sac was found, with no intestinal involvement. Further exploration revealed a hematoma and tumor on the liver surface. Finally, he was diagnosed with spontaneous ruptured HCC and underwent successful emergency hepatic resection. Spontaneous ruptured HCC can potentially mimic other abdominal conditions such as an inguinal hernia, even in cases of undiagnosed liver cirrhosis. Although unenhanced CT can reveal bloody ascites suggesting hemoperitoneum, the underlying cause should be carefully considered. Emergency physicians should recognize various clinical presentations of spontaneous ruptured HCC to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment of this potentially fatal complication."

    "abstract": "Purulent pericarditis is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by infection of the pericardial space. We describe a case of purulent bacterial pericarditis in a 41-year-old male with no significant medical or surgical history who had concomitant pulmonary Histoplasma infection. Streptococcus intermedius was the bacteria directly responsible for the pericardial infection, though co-infection with histoplasmosis likely predisposed him to develop purulent pericarditis. We hypothesize histoplasmosis caused mediastinal lymphadenopathy, facilitating contact between a necrotic lymph node and the pericardium and contiguous suppuration of bacteria to the pericardial space. We treated S. intermedius and Histoplasma capsulatum with ceftriaxone and amphotericin B, respectively. Additionally, the patient presented in cardiac tamponade requiring emergent pericardiocentesis and drain placement. His course was also complicated by pericardial constriction. Cardiac magnetic resonance confirmed this, showing inflamed pericardium and abnormal septal motion with inspiration, and he had symptoms refractory to antimicrobials and anti-inflammatories. As such, he required pericardiectomy. This case demonstrates maintaining suspicion for secondary infectious foci as a contributor to the pathogenesis of purulent pericarditis is important, as pulmonary histoplasmosis played a pivotal role in allowing S. intermedius to spread to the pericardium but was not the primary infection. It also highlights the multifaceted evaluation and management of purulent pericarditis, highlighting the role of echocardiography and emergent pericardial drainage if cardiac tamponade is present, the importance of targeted antimicrobial therapy, the superior ability of cardiac magnetic resonance to identify pericardial constriction as a sequela of purulent pericarditis, and indications for pericardiectomy."

Subsequently, patient represented with worsening of chest pain and tachycardia. CT requested to rule out pulmonary embolism revealed a large pericardial effusion. Urgent drainage via apical approach resolved tamponade.

Literature review highlights risks associated with fixation devices. Suggestions include limiting their use near vital structures. Key learning point of this case report is to raise awareness of cardiac tamponade following diaphragmatic hernia repair.

This report presents 2 cases of maternal mortality resulting from peripartum clostridial myonecrosis of the uterus. Case 1 is a 30-year-old woman (nullipara) who presented in labor at term with an intra-amniotic infection and fetal demise. She rapidly developed septic shock, and cesarean hysterectomy was performed for a suspected necrotizing uterine infection later identified to be Clostridium septicum. Case 2 is an adolescent who presented in septic shock following first trimester medication abortion and died during emergent exploratory laparotomy; cultures grew Clostridium sordellii. Both patients expired within 18 hours of hospital admission. Given the rapidly progressive course of clostridial infections, maintaining a high index of suspicion is imperative for ensuring timely diagnosis and effective treatment. Prompt recognition of clinical features associated with clostridial myonecrosis - abdominal pain, tachycardia, leukocytosis and hyponatremia - is essential in preventing mortality. The utilization of point-of-care ultrasound may expedite the diagnosis of uterine myonecrosis. When uterine myonecrosis is suspected, immediate initiation of penicillin-based antibiotics, alongside clindamycin, and aggressive surgical intervention including hysterectomy are essential for ensuring survival. Although the decision to perform a hysterectomy can be challenging, especially in cases involving child-bearing-aged patients, it is a vital step to avert a fatal outcome. By presenting these cases, we aim to raise awareness of this uncommon, but highly lethal infection to expedite diagnosis and treatment to improve patient outcomes."

However, BTK carry the risk of cardiotoxicity, which is not only limited to atrial fibrillation. Case Reports. We report three cases of patients on BTK inhibitors who developed acute pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. We report the first patient who developed this complication on treatment with zanubrutinib. This patient's treatment was changed to zanubrutinib due to atrial fibrillation. Shortly after cardioversion, he developed cardiac tamponade and shock. He underwent pericardiocentesis, received treatment for acute pericarditis with steroids and colchicine, and made a full recovery. We also report two further cases, both involving patients treated with ibrutinib. These patients also developed acute pericarditis and cardiac tamponade and required pericardiocentesis. All three patients discontinued BTK therapy following the events. These three cases highlight the rare but potentially life-threatening risk of cardiac tamponade which can occur even with newer generations of BTK inhibitors. Haemato-oncologists should remain vigilant in patients who report dyspnea or who show sinus tachycardia on routine electrocardiography. Even in the absence of classical clinical signs of tamponade, patients require urgent evaluation with echocardiography and potentially emergency pericardiocentesis."

We can assume that this increased use, results in a higher incidence of post-colonoscopy complications such postpolypectomy syndrome, perforation and post-colonoscopy appendicitis (PCA). In this report, we present a case of PCA presenting to the emergency department within 12 h of a screening colonoscopy. Our patient, a 77-year-old male, underwent an uncomplicated screening colonoscopy and was discharged home after briefly being monitored without any complaints. Later that day, the patient presented to the emergency department complaining of acute generalized abdominal pain. On presentation, the patient was found to be hypertensive and febrile with a distended abdomen with right lower quadrant tenderness on examination. Laboratory investigations noted an elevated white blood cell count with no evidence of acute appendicitis or focal inflammatory changes on contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic computer tomography. The patient was subsequently admitted and developed worsening right lower quadrant abdominal pain and distention overnight. Due to this worsening clinical condition, the decision was made to proceed with a diagnostic laparoscopy. After frank pus was found laparoscopically around the cecum and appendix, it was then converted to an exploratory laparotomy. Subsequently, a perforated gangrenous appendix was found with an erythematous and indurated cecum. Major complications of colonoscopy can include perforation and/or post-colonoscopy bleeding which have been shown to have a respective incidence of 0.21% and 0.1%. With the anticipated rise in the number of colonoscopies, much rarer complications such as PCA with an incidence of less than 0.05% will be seen more frequently. Due to its nonspecific presentation, it is necessary for providers to consider PCA as an important differential for all patients presenting with abdominal pain after a colonoscopy."

    "abstract": "The assessment of hemodynamic status in polytrauma patients is an important principle of the primary survey of trauma patients, and screening for ongoing hemorrhage and assessing the efficacy of resuscitation is vital in avoiding preventable death and significant morbidity in these patients. Invasive procedures may lead to various complications and the IVC ultrasound measurements are increasingly recognized as a potential noninvasive replacement or a source of adjunct information. The study aimed to determine if repeated ultrasound assessment of the inferior vena cava (diameter, collapsibility (IVC- CI) in major trauma patients presenting with collapsible IVC before resuscitation and after the first hour of resuscitation will predict total intravenous fluid requirements at first 24 h. The current study was conducted on 120 patients presented to the emergency department with Major blunt trauma (having significant injury to two or more ISS body regions or an ISS greater than 15). The patients(cases) group (shocked group) (60) patients with signs of shock such as decreased blood pressure < 90/60 mmHg or a more than 30% decrease from the baseline systolic pressure, heart rate > 100 b/m, cold, clammy skin, capillary refill > 2 s and their shock index above0.9. The control group (non-shocked group) (60) patients with normal blood pressure and heart rate, no other signs of shock (normal capillary refill, warm skin), and (shock index ≤ 0.9). Patients were evaluated at time 0 (baseline), 1 h after resucitation, and 24 h after 1st hour for:(blood pressure, pulse, RR, SO2, capillary refill time, MABP, IVCci, IVCmax, IVCmin). Among 120 Major blunt trauma patients, 98 males (81.7%) and 22 females (18.3%) were included in this analysis; hypovolemic shocked patients (60 patients) were divided into two main groups according to IVC diameter after the first hour of resuscitation; IVC repleted were 32 patients (53.3%) while 28 patients (46.7%) were IVC non-repleted. In our study population, there were statistically significant differences between repleted and non-repleted IVC cases regarding IVCD, DIVC min, IVCCI (on arrival) (after 1 h) (after 24 h of 1st hour of resuscitation) ( p-value < 0.05) and DIVC Max (on arrival) (after 1 h) (p-value < 0.001). There is no statistically significant difference (p-value = 0.075) between repleted and non-repleted cases regarding DIVC Max (after 24 h).In our study, we found that IVCci0 at a cut-off point > 38.5 has a sensitivity of 80.0% and Specificity of 85.71% with AUC 0.971 and a good 95% CI (0.938 - 1.0), which means that IVCci of 38.6% or more can indicate fluid responsiveness. We also found that IVCci 1 h (after fluid resuscitation) at cut-off point > 28.6 has a sensitivity of 80.0% and Specificity of 75% with AUC 0.886 and good 95% CI (0.803 - 0.968), which means that IVCci of 28.5% or less can indicate fluid unresponsiveness after 1st hour of resuscitation. We found no statistically significant difference between repleted and non-repleted cases regarding fluid requirement and amount of blood transfusion at 1st hour of resuscitation (p-value = 0.104). Repeated bedside ultrasonography of IVCD, and IVCci before and after the first hour of resuscitation could be an excellent reliable invasive tool that can be used in estimating the First 24 h of fluid requirement in Major blunt trauma patients and assessment of fluid status."

Emergency surgery was performed to stop bleeding and confirm the source of bleeding, and dark red pericardial fluid and hematoma were observed in the pericardial sac. There was no postoperative recurrence of cardiac tamponade. He died 1 year and 2 months after the operation. Case 2:A 77-year-old woman underwent thoracoscopic left upper lobectomy and lymph node dissection for lung cancer. The patient did well until the 6th postoperative day. On the 7th postoperative day, she complained of sudden severe back pain, immediately after which she lost consciousness and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. The echocardiography revealed cardiac tamponade, and emergency pericardiocentesis was performed. The patient died without circulatory improvement despite drainage of approximately 200 ml of bloody pericardial fluid. The pathological findings of autopsy revealed penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer at the descending aorta. We speculated that severe back pain caused the afterload of left ventricle and the increase in left atrial pressure through mitral regurgitation, which might result in a bleeding from the staple-line of superior pulmonary vein in the pericardium."

    "abstract": "Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the proliferation of autoantibodies and immune dysregulation resulting in damage to many body organs. Pediatric SLE usually presents with fever, joint pain, rashes, and lupus nephritis. It is uncommon to have large pericardial effusions in children with SLE and cardiac tamponade as the initial presentation of SLE is even rarer. An 11-year-old female presented to our Children Emergency Unit with fever and fast breathing for two weeks, bilateral leg swelling of four days, and cough of two days duration. She was acutely ill, tachypneic, and dyspneic with marked orthopnea, bilateral leg edema, and raised JVP. She was tachycardic with a diffuse apex beat. Chest X-ray showed a large globular heart. 2D-Echocardiography showed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with a dilated non-collapsing IVC and diastolic collapse of the right ventricle. She had a pericardiotomy done and 650mls of serous pericardial fluid was drained. The inner pericardium had a fibrinoid exudate with a \"bread-and-butter\" appearance. Pericardial fluid cytology showed no malignant cells while pericardial biopsy showed suppurative granulomatous inflammation. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was strongly positive. The patient was managed with corticosteroids, colchicine, and hydroxychloroquine, and has remained stable on follow-up. While cardiac tamponade as an initial presenting complaint in SLE is rare, it is important that children presenting with large pericardial effusions and tamponade be evaluated for rheumatologic disorders. This can be crucial to revealing the correct diagnosis and instituting appropriate care."

    "title": "Penetrating abdominal stab and gunshot injuries: 10-year experience of a secondary public hospital located in a suburban area with solo surgeons.",
    "abstract": "Trauma care systems are life-saving significant implementations of a country's healthcare systems. Trauma care requires well-established trauma settings and organizations with experienced trauma teams including experienced emergency medicine, surgery and anesthesiology staff. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of penetrating abdominal injuries treated by solo surgeons in a suburban area. Medical records of the patients who were admitted to the emergency department with penetrating abdominal injuries between January 2012 and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were evaluated based on their injury sites and treatment approaches. In total, 110 patients with anterior abdominal penetrating injuries were enrolled in the study; 83 (75.4%) were stabbed and 27 (24.6%) had gunshot wounds. According to the injury site, there were 90 (81.8%) anterior; 11 (11%) right thoracoabdominal and 9 (7.2%) left thoracoabdominal injuries. Fifty-one (61.4%) stab wounds were treated with immediate laparotomy and 21 (41.1%) of these operations resulted in negative or nontherapeutic laparotomy. Also, 32 (38.6%) stab wounds were managed nonoperatively; three (9.3%) failed conservative management and received delayed laparotomy. All gunshot wounds were treated with immediate laparotomy and 14.8% resulted in either negative or nontherapeutic laparotomy. On-call surgeons were found to be more prone to perform immediate laparotomy on weekends when they were on call for 48 or 72 hours. Being a solo surgeon may increase negative laparotomy rates of penetrating abdominal injuries. This high percentage (41.1%) of negative laparotomy rates can be reduced by establishing well-organized trauma teams."

    "abstract": "Diagnosing non-gestational uterine choriocarcinoma in children is challenging because of its rarity and nonspecific imaging findings. Herein, we report a case of non-gestational uterine choriocarcinoma in a child, which was unexpectedly found during exploratory laparotomy and confirmed by histopathological findings. However, the tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. A 4-year-old Indonesian female patient was brought into the emergency unit with chief complaint of vaginal bleeding. She had suffered from vaginal spotting 4 months before being admitted to the hospital. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen in the left lumbar region and a palpable fixed mass with a smooth surface. Abdominal computed tomography scans revealed a large mass (10 × 6 × 12 cm) with fluid density and calcification. Thus, we suspected left ovarian teratoma. The patient's luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were 25.2 mIU/ml, 0.1 mIU/ml, and 406 U/l, respectively. According to the clinical and radiological findings, we decided to perform an exploratory laparotomy and found a tumor originating from the uterus, not the ovarium. We did not observe liver nodules and any enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes. Subsequently, we performed hysterectomy. The histopathological findings supported the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 5. Thereafter, the patient underwent nine cycles of chemotherapy, including carboplatin (600 mg/m2 IV), etoposide (120 mg/m2 IV), and bleomycin (15 mg/m2 IV). However, on the basis of the clinical findings of a palpable mass and partial intestinal obstruction, the tumor relapsed soon after the ninth cycle of chemotherapy. Currently, the patient is undergoing chemotherapy again. Although pure non-gestational uterine choriocarcinoma is rare, it should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses for intraabdominal tumors in a child, so as to better guide and counsel families regarding the surgical plan and prognosis, respectively. In the present case, the patient's response to chemotherapy was poor, implying that the treatment of non-gestational choriocarcinoma is still challenging, particularly in the pediatric population."

    "abstract": "Penetrating thoracic injuries have a significant risk of morbi-mortality. Despite the advancements in damage control methods, a subset of patients with severe pulmonary vascular lesions and bronchial injuries persists. In some of these cases, post-traumatic pneumonectomy is required, and perioperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support may be required due to right ventricular failure and respiratory failure. A male was brought to the emergency department (ED) with a penetrating thoracic injury, presenting with massive right hemothorax and active bleeding that required ligation of the right pulmonary hilum to control the bleeding. Subsequently, he developed right ventricular dysfunction and ARDS, necessitating a dynamic hybrid ECMO configuration to support his condition and facilitate recovery. Penetrating thoracic injuries with severe pulmonary vascular lesions may need pneumonectomy to control bleeding. ECMO support reduces the associated mortality by decreasing the complications rate. A multidisciplinary team is essential to achieve good outcomes in severe compromised patients."

    "abstract": "Traumatic vascular injuries consist of direct or indirect damage to arteries and/or veins and account for 3% of all traumatic injuries. Typical consequences are hemorrhage and ischemia. Vascular injuries of the extremities can occur isolated or in association with major trauma and other organ injuries. They account for 1-2% of patients admitted to emergency departments and for approximately 50% of all arterial injuries. Lower extremities are more frequently injured than upper ones in the adult population. The outcome of vascular injuries is strictly correlated to the environment and the time background. Treatment can be challenging, notably in polytrauma because of the dilemma of which injury should be prioritized, and treatment delay can cause disability or even death, especially for limb vascular injury. Our purposes are to discuss the role of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the diagnosis of vascular trauma and its optimized protocol to achieve a definitive diagnosis and to assess the radiological signs of vascular injuries and the possible pitfalls."

    "abstract": "Subclavian arterial injury due to blunt trauma is rare but can have devastating outcomes. Massive hemorrhage or limb ischemia might develop depending on the extent of damage, and open repair might be necessary to salvage the limb. However, life-saving treatments should be prioritized in critically unstable patients. A 21-year-old male patient who was transferred to our trauma center following a motorcycle accident. Abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed right renal injury and massive hemothorax with several rib fractures in the right chest. Right renal injury with multiple extravasations and right 8th intercostal arterial injury were detected during angiography. Emergent exploration with lateral thoracotomy was performed to manage right hemothorax. Pulsating bleeding from the thoracic roof observed in the operative field suggested a subclavian arterial injury. The unstable vital signs did not recover despite massive transfusion, and his right arm had already stiffened. Therefore, endovascular approach was adopted and the second portion of the right subclavian artery was embolized using microcoils and thrombin. Postoperative intensive care unit management performed to resuscitate patient from multiorgan failure included continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). After confirming the demarcation lines, transhumeral amputation of the right arm was performed on admission day 12. The patient recovered from multiorgan failure for more than 3 weeks after the accident; however, the patient survived. Limb salvage, albeit critical for quality of life, is not possible in some cases where life-saving measures require its sacrifice. In these cases, quick decision-making by the surgeon is paramount for patient survival. As illustrated in this case, endovascular approaches should be considered less invasive measures to save the patient's life."

We present the case of a 63-year-old female with chronic heart failure and newly diagnosed hypothyroidism, who presented to her primary care physician complaining of progressively worsening dyspnea. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. An emergent pericardial window was performed, resulting in an improvement in left ventricular systolic function. Pericardial tissue biopsy was normal. Thyroid function tests were consistent with severe primary hypothyroidism. After inpatient treatment with intravenous levothyroxine and interval resolution of symptoms without recurrence of effusion, the patient was discharged home on oral levothyroxine therapy. Close follow up with surveillance echocardiography was planned. While metabolic disorders are seldom thought of as an etiology, it is imperative for clinicians to recognize hypothyroidism as a cause of the pericardial effusion. It is one of the few reversible causes and delay in treatment can result in fatal sequelae."

    "abstract": "Supravesical hernias are rare internal hernias but potential cause of small-bowel obstruction. The clinical features are often non-specific, preoperative diagnosis is very difficult and is often diagnosed intraoperatively. The exact pathogenesis is unclear with the major risk factors of prematurity, a positive family history, male sex, smoking habits leading to decreased collagen production, advancing age, and conditions characterized by defective collagen synthesis. The authors are reporting a case of small-bowel obstruction secondary to a supravesical hernia, in a 78-year-old male presented with central abdominal pain, vomiting and obstipation. Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis identified a marked dilation of the small-bowel loop with multiple loops of dilated jejunum and ileum in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with lead point from the terminal ileum. Exploratory laparotomy was done with the diagnosis of left posterior a left posterior superior vesical hernia with small-bowel obstruction. The case focuses supravesical hernia as a rare yet life-threatening etiology of small-bowel obstruction, emphasizing the importance of clinical suspicion when patients present with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction. While diagnosis often occurs intraoperatively, the utilization of CT scans in emergency settings can provide valuable insights into the location, potential causes, and condition of the herniated bowel sac. The case highlights the pivotal role of CT scans in diagnosis and emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary cooperation among clinicians, radiologists, and surgeons. Early intervention ensures better outcomes and prevents irreversible bowel damage, underscoring the importance of a comprehensive approach to patient care."

A 44-year-old Japanese woman presented with a left upper eyelid nodule in February 2023. A pigmented conjunctival mass was present in the upper palpebral conjunctiva. Enhanced computed tomography demonstrated marked enhancement in the left eyelid in the artery phase, indicating hemangioma. The patient suffered blunt trauma to the face in May 2023 and continuous bleeding occurred. Doctors in the emergency room attempted hemostasis by diathermy and suture, but the bleeding could not be stopped. The patient eventually underwent emergent orbital exenteration of the left eye. At high magnification of the histology sample of the bleeding site, small-to-large vascular channels with various vascular lumens made up of endothelial cells within the conjunctival melanoma tissue could be observed. The tumor cells were positive for SOX10, Melan A, S100 and HMB45. We herein propose a novel variant of conjunctival melanoma with rich vascularization, clinically causing persistent bleeding."

    "abstract": "New Injury Severity Score (NISS) and Glasgow Coma Scale, Age and Pressure (GAP) scoring systems have cutoffs to define severe injury and identify high-risk patients. This is important in trauma quality monitoring and improvement. The overall aim was to explore if GAP scoring system can be a complement or an alternative to the traditional NISS scoring system. Adults exposed to trauma between 2017 and 2021 were included in the study, using data from The Swedish Trauma Registry. The performance of NISS and GAP scores in predicting mortality, and ICU admissions were assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristics (AUROC) in all patients and in subgroups (blunt, penetrating trauma and older (≥65 years) trauma patients). Patients were classified as severely injured by NISS >15 as Severely Injured NISS (SIN) or with a high-risk for mortality, by GAP 3-18 as High Risk GAP (HRG). Undertriage was calculated based on the cutoffs HRG and SIN. Overall, 37,017 patients were included. The AUROC (95 % CI) for mortality using NISS was 0.84 (0.83-0.85) and for GAP 0.92 (0.91-0.93) (p-value <0.001), the AUROC (95 % CI) for ICU-admissions was 0.82 (0.82-0.83) using NISS and for GAP 0.70 (0.70-0.71) p-value <0.001, in the overall cohort. In older patients the AUROC (95 % CI) for mortality was 0.76 (0.75-0.78) using NISS and 0.79 (0.78-0.81) using GAP, p-value <0.001. Overall, 8,572 (23.2 %) and 2,908 (7.9 %) were classified as SIN and HRG, respectively, with mortality rates of 13.7 % and 34.3 %. In the HRG group low-energy falls dominated and in the SIN group most patients were exposed to MVCs. In the SIN and HRG groups the rate of Emergency Trauma Interventions according to Utstein guidelines (ETIU) and ICU admission was 14.0 vs 9.5 % and 47.0 vs 62.5 % respectively. Our findings suggest that the GAP score and its cutoff 3-18 can be used to define severe trauma as complement to NISS >15 and can be a valuable tool in trauma quality monitoring and improvement. However, both scoring systems were less accurate in predicting mortality for the older trauma patients and should be explored further."

In this case report, we emphasize the diagnostic importance of multimodality imaging and the need for additional procedures, such as tissue biopsy, in a case with a primary cardiac lymphoma presenting with cardiac tamponade. An 80-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with a life-threatening tamponade demanding immediate sternotomy. Pre-operative echocardiography unveiled pericardial effusion and a thickened apex. While computed tomography ruled out an aortic dissection, surgery revealed an unexpected vascular-rich mass at the right ventricle and apex, too perilous for biopsy. Post-operative imaging misinterpreted this mass as a benign haematoma. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, but after a conservative treatment strategy, the patient died. An autopsy revealed a primary CDLBCL. This case demonstrates the deceptive nature of primary CDLBCL, often complicated by cardiac tamponade. It underscores the pivotal role of pathologic assessment, even amidst the perils of sternotomy, to determine the origin of abnormal cardiac masses. A heightened awareness among physicians is imperative, for such elusive diagnoses may slip by, with potentially fatal outcomes."

Materials and methods. Case report of a 71-year-old female who presents a rare complication due to a perforation in the sigmoid which developed pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and massive subcutaneous emphysema as a complication of a diagnostic colonoscopy where a biopsy of a friable lesion was performed. A 71-year-old female that went to the emergency room due to acute generalized abdominal colic spasm pain with a duration of 7 hours, associated with significant abdominal distension, malaise, diaphoresis, progressive dyspnea, and massive subcutaneous emphysema that developed after performing panendoscopy and colonoscopy for diverticulosis follow-up. An abdominal CT scan with double contrast was performed, reporting suggestive data of hollow viscus perforation, pneumoperitoneum, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and massive subcutaneous emphysema in the thorax, neck, and skull base. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy finding a perforation in the sigmoid for which sigmoidectomy was performed, and for the pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, endopleural tubes were placed in both hemithoraxes. The massive subcutaneous emphysema subsided with observation and oxygen. A rare complication of the use of colonoscopy as a diagnostic and therapeutic method is presented. The purpose of presenting this case is for the doctor who performs these interventions to suspect this complication in a timely manner, not delaying the diagnosis and carrying out an urgent therapeutic approach as in this case with exploratory laparotomy, finding the perforation site and carrying out the corresponding surgical management. We demonstrated that massive subcutaneous emphysema can be managed with observation if there is no other alarm data evident that required another surgical approach."

This case report involves a primigravida patient who presented to the emergency department of the General Hospital of Trikala at 15 weeks of gestation due to diffuse abdominal pain, primarily in the epigastric region. She also reported watery bowel movements. The ongoing atypical clinical symptoms, along with elevated inflammatory markers, strongly indicated a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. An immediate exploratory laparotomy was performed, during which acute localized inflammation of the appendix was found, leading to an appendectomy. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patient reported pain relief immediately after the surgery. On the fourth postoperative day, she was discharged without any signs of a threatened second-trimester miscarriage. At 39 gestational weeks, she delivered by elective cesarean section due to breech presentation.

This study aimed to derive and validate a prediction rule that reliably identifies injured children who are at very low risk for requiring emergency surgery upon emergency department (ED) arrival. A retrospective cohort study of data included in the Israeli National Trauma Registry from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2020, was conducted. We included children aged 0-14 years who presented to EDs from the scene of injury and were hospitalized. We excluded patients transferred between facilities or with isolated burns. The primary outcome was emergency operative intervention (EOI) performed within one hour of ED arrival. We tested mechanism, GCS, heart rate, and blood pressure as candidate predictors. We then randomized patients to two cohorts, derived and internally validated a prediction rule. During the study period, 83,859 children met enrollment criteria. The median age was 6 years (IQR 2-10) and 56,867 (67.8 %) were male; 75,450 (90.0 %) sustained blunt trauma. One hundred sixty-nine (0.20 %) children underwent EOI. In the derivation and validation cohorts, 34,138 (81.4 %) and 34,271 (81.7 %) patients, were classified as low risk based on blunt trauma mechanism, normal GCS (15), and low-risk heart rate (according to age). Of those, 8 (0.02 %) and 13 (0.04 %) required an EOI, respectively. In the validation cohort, the prediction rule for EOI had a sensitivity of 84 % (95 % CI 75-91), a specificity of 82 % (95 % CI 81-82), and a negative predictive value of 99.96 % (95 % CI 99.94-99.98). Among children with an Injury Severity Score>15, the sensitivity was 87 % (95 % CI 77-94), the specificity of 57 % (95 % CI 54-59), and the negative predictive value was 98.97 % (95 % CI 98.13-99.44). A limited set of physiologic parameters, readily available at hospital admission can effectively identify injured children at very low risk for emergent surgery. For these children, immediate deployment of surgical resources may not be necessary."

However, the suitability of ERPs in trauma surgery remains unclear. This study aimed to (1) design and implement an ERP for trauma laparotomy patients; (2) assess its safety, feasibility, and efficacy; and (3) compare the outcomes of the proposed ERP with conventional practices. This case-matched study prospectively enrolled hemodynamically stable patients undergoing emergency laparotomy after penetrating trauma. Patients receiving the proposed ERP were compared to historical controls who had received conventional treatment from two to eight years prior to protocol implementation. Cases were matched for age, sex, injury mechanism, extra-abdominal injuries, and trauma scores. Assessment of intervention effects were modelled using regression analysis for outcome measures, including length of hospital stay (LOS), postoperative complications, and functional recovery parameters. Thirty-six consecutive patients were enrolled in the proposed ERP and matched to their 36 historical counterparts, totaling 72 participants. A statistically significant decrease in LOS, representing a 39% improvement in average LOS was observed. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications. Opioid consumption was considerably lower in the ERP group (p < 0.010). Time to resumption of oral liquid and solid intake, as well as to the removal of nasogastric tubes, urinary catheters, and abdominal drains was significantly earlier among ERP patients (p < 0.001). The implementation of a standardized ERP for the perioperative care of penetrating abdominal trauma patients yielded a significant reduction in LOS without increasing postoperative complications. These findings demonstrate that ERPs principles can be safely applied to selected trauma patients."

    "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by low thyroid hormone levels that can affect multiple organ systems with varying symptomatology. Common cardiac manifestations of hypothyroidism include bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. Pericardial effusion can also occur as a result of the condition and rarely can progress to cardiac tamponade. Patients with cardiac tamponade occurring as a result of underlying hypothyroidism can present atypically compared to those experiencing cardiac tamponade due to other causes. Patients with cardiac tamponade as a result of underlying hypothyroidism may present as minimally symptomatic with stable vital signs. Close monitoring of patients with pericardial effusions with underlying hypothyroidism is essential to permit early diagnosis and treatment of the condition. We outline the case of a 73-year-old male presenting with cardiac tamponade due to underlying hypothyroidism necessitating an urgent pericardial window."

    "abstract": "Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), surgery for left ventricular free wall rupture (LVFWR) and ventricular septal rupture (VSR) has a high in-hospital mortality rate, which has not improved significantly over time. Unloading the LV is critical to preventing excessive stress on the repair site and avoiding problems such as bleeding, leaks, patch dehiscence, and recurrence of LVFWR and VSR because the tissue is so fragile. We present two cases of patients who used Impella 5.5 for LV unloading following emergency surgery for AMI mechanical complications. A 76-year-old male STEMI patient underwent fibrinolysis of the distal right coronary artery. Three days later, he passed out and went into shock. Echocardiography revealed a cardiac tamponade. We found an oozing-type LVFWR on the posterolateral wall and treated it with a non-suture technique using TachoSil. Before the patient was taken off CPB, Impella 5.5 was inserted into the LV via a 10 mm synthetic graft connected to the right axillary artery. We kept the flow rate above 4.0 to 4.5 L/min until POD 3 to reduce LV wall tension while minimizing pulsatility. On POD 6, we weaned the patient from Impella 5.5. A postoperative cardiac CT scan showed no contrast leakage from the LV. However, a cerebral hemorrhage on POD 4 during heparin administration complicated his hospitalization. Case 2: A diagnosis of cardiogenic shock caused by STEMI occurred in an 84-year-old male patient, who underwent PCI of the LAD with IABP support. Three days after PCI, echocardiography revealed VSR, and the patient underwent emergency VSR repair with two separate patches and BioGlue applied to the suture line between them. Before weaning from CPB, we implanted Impella 5.5 in the LV and added venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support for right heart failure. The postoperative echocardiography revealed no residual shunt. Patients undergoing emergency surgery for mechanical complications of AMI may find Impella 5.5 to be an effective tool for LV unloading. The use of VA-ECMO in conjunction with Impella may be an effective strategy for managing VSR associated with concurrent right-sided heart failure."

A 56-year-old male patient came to our outpatient department complaining of upper abdominal pain with a few episodes of vomiting for three days. He had alcoholism, smoked for 15 years, and had no past history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, TB, or HIV. An abdominal ultrasound and CT scan at admission showed pancreatitis with a splenic abscess. After five days of admission, the patient's vitals deteriorated, and he had severe abdominal pain. CT scan suggested a splenic abscess rupture with hemoperitoneum. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a splenectomy was done due to the splenic abscess rupture. A cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test from splenic intracapsular fluid detected a trace Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The patient was discharged after starting first-line antitubercular treatment for six months. After three months of follow-up, the patient was doing well with no complaints."

Barium sulfate is a contrast agent that may be used to enhance certain imaging studies. Although barium-contrasted studies are generally safe, they are not without risk for complications. Barium impactions, and their management, are infrequently reported in scientific literature. We present a case of a patient with barium impaction who presented at the emergency room after a fall from standing with associated symptoms of abdominal pain, weakness, and fatigue. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan performed on presentation revealed the barium impaction, and initial attempts at conservative management were unsuccessful. A decompressive colonoscopy was performed without successful dissolution of the barium. Ultimately, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a contained perforation of the sigmoid colon, and a successful partial colectomy with end colostomy was performed. This case study explores the surgical management of barium impaction in a comorbid patient."

There are a variety of etiologies of small bowel obstruction. Infrequently, small bowel malignancies can first present as small bowel obstruction. In exceedingly rare cases, leiomyosarcomas can be the offending malignancy. A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency department with several weeks of persistent right abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomography scan revealed a central necrotic mass within the right lower quadrant originating from the small bowel. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy to relieve the obstruction and a mass was identified originating from the terminal ileum that adhered to surrounding structures. Pathological analysis determined the mass to be small bowel leiomyosarcoma. Leiomyosarcoma is definitively diagnosed after primary resection with histopathology and immunohistochemistry. As opposed to other small bowel neoplasms, surgical resection with negative margins is the only potentially curative option."

We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of DFC versus immediate fascial closure (IFC) in EGS patients with intra-abdominal contamination. This retrospective study was conducted using the 2013-2020 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Adult EGS patients who underwent an exploratory laparotomy with intra-abdominal contamination [wound classification III (contaminated) or IV (dirty)] were included. Patients with agreed upon indications for DFC were excluded. A propensity-matched analysis was performed. The primary outcome was 30-d mortality. We identified 36,974 eligible patients. 16.8% underwent DFC, of which 51.7% were female, and the median age was 64 y. After matching, there were 6213 pairs. DFC was associated with a higher risk of mortality (15.8% versus 14.2%, P = 0.016), pneumonia (11.7% versus 10.1%, P = 0.007), pulmonary embolism (1.9% versus 1.6%, P = 0.03), and longer hospital stay (11 versus 10 d, P < 0.001). No significant differences in postoperative sepsis and deep surgical site infection rates between the two groups were observed. Subgroup analyses by preoperative diagnosis (diverticulitis, perforation, and undifferentiated sepsis) showed that DFC was associated with longer hospital stay in all subgroups, with a higher mortality rate in patients with diverticulitis (8.1% versus 6.1%, P = 0.027). In the presence of intra-abdominal contamination, DFC is associated with longer hospital stay and higher rates of mortality and morbidity. DFC was not associated with decreased risk of infectious complications. Further studies are needed to clearly define the indications of DFC."

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis intestinalis and pneumoperitoneum are not pathological entities in themselves, they are radiological signs that result from some underlying condition. In general, these are associated with serious intra-abdominal processes that result in emergency surgeries with bowel resections. Below, we present the case of an 80-year-old woman, diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer under treatment with fulvestrant and ribociclib, who was admitted to our center due to abdominal pain and vomiting. She was diagnosed with intestinal pneumatosis and pneumoperitoneum, so she underwent exploratory laparotomy for suspected intestinal ischemia. There was no evidence of intestinal necrosis or perforation, so resection was not performed. She progressed satisfactorily during hospitalization and in the tomographic control one month after discharge there was complete resolution of the condition. Although this condition has been described in relation to episodes of increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as emesis, it has also been described in patients with neoplasms, mainly of the digestive tract, either due to local damage or toxicity associated with chemotherapy. We found no reports in the literature of pneumatosis intestinalis linked to this antineoplastic medication in humans. Probably in our case the etiology was multifactorial. It is possible that ribociclib played a role, either through an indirect mechanism associated with vomiting and immunosuppression or directly on the enterocyte due to its non-specific cellular mechanism of action. La neumatosis intestinal y el neumoperitoneo no son entidades patológicas en sí mismas, son signos radiológicos que resultan de alguna condición subyacente. En general, estos se asocian con procesos graves intraabdominales que resultan en cirugías de urgencias con resecciones de intestino. A continuación, presentamos el caso de una mujer de 80 años, con diagnóstico de cáncer de mama estadio IV en tratamiento con fulvestrant y ribociclib, que ingresó a nuestro centro por dolor abdominal y vómitos. Se diagnosticó neumatosis intestinal y neumoperitoneo por lo que se procedió a laparotomía exploradora por sospecha de isquemia intestinal. No hubo evidencia de necrosis o perforación intestinal por lo que no se realizó resección. Evolucionó durante la internación de forma satisfactoria y en el control tomográfico al mes del egreso hubo resolución completa del cuadro. Si bien está descrito esta afectación en relación a los episodios de aumento de presión intraabdominal, como en la emesis, también se describió en pacientes con neoplasias, principalmente del tubo digestivo, ya sea por daño local o por toxicidad asociada a la quimioterapia. No encontramos reportes en la literatura de neumatosis intestinal vinculada a esta medicación antineoplásica en humanos. Probablemente en nuestro caso la etiología haya sido multifactorial. Es posible que el ribociclib haya jugado un rol, ya sea por un mecanismo indirecto asociado a los vómitos y la inmunosupresión o directo sobre el enterocito debido a su mecanismo de acción celular no específico."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate transport trends and how they are linked to SS in the period of 2016-2021 in Camden, NJ. This was a single-center, retrospective observational study. Demographics, response time, transport time, and clinical data were collected. Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test, and linear regression to correct for transport time and method of transport were used to compare outcomes (P < 0.05). A total of 267 GSWs were included: 77 emergency medical technicians (EMS)-SS, 41 EMS-NSS, 116 PD-SS, and 33 PD-NSS. When comparing response from 2016 to 2021, PD improved from 4 to 2 min (P = 0.001). EMS improved from 6.4 min (EMS-NSS) and 4.5 min (EMS-SS) to 5 min (EMS- NSS) and 4 min (EMS-SS) (P = 0.281). In addition, PD transport times, 5 min (SS) and 4 min (NSS), were faster than EMS, 9 min (SS and NSS) (P < 0.001). Overall PD transport volume increased with a peak in 2020 (68.3%). There was also an increase in PD-NSS transport 4% to 37.9% (P < 0.001). EMS-SS transport decreased from 54.7% to 6.9% (P < 0.001). The presence of SS technology in a small urban setting continues to be associated with a higher rate of PD transport of GSW victims. The critical time of dispatch and transport for both PD and EMS has shown durable improvement."

    "title": "Enhancing Healing Strategies: Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy and Delayed Primary Closure in Abdominal Wounds Post-emergency Laparotomy for Intestinal Perforation.",
    "abstract": "Background Intestinal perforation is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate surgical intervention. Surgical-site infections (SSIs) and wound dehiscence are common complications associated with emergency laparotomy for intestinal perforation. Finding optimal wound management and postoperative strategies can significantly impact patient outcomes and reduce the risk of complications. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a relatively recent tool employed in the care of wounds to control SSIs and foster healing. Methodology A prospective, observational, cohort study was conducted among 150 patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy due to intestinal perforation at the general surgery department of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi between July 2022 and December 2023. Preoperatively, all patients underwent initial resuscitation. Intraoperatively, the extent of peritonitis was determined and was categorized according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification. Postoperatively, NPWT dressing was applied to the patient's midline laparotomy wound on postoperative day (POD) two. Negative pressure was set at 75-125 mmHg with suction. The number of NPWT dressing changes required was documented. The wound was closed with vertical mattress sutures under local anesthesia, delayed primary closure (DPC). The incidence of SSIs, the duration for DPC, the incidence of fascial dehiscence, the number of NPWT dressing changes, and the length of hospital stay were documented according to CDC groups. Results The mean age in CDC categories 2, 3, and 4 were 31.789, 28.733, and 42.676 years, respectively. The most common cause of perforation was enteric fever (n = 42, 28%), followed by tuberculosis (n = 36, 24%). Most patients had no known comorbidities (n = 80, 53.3%). Overall, 16% of patients (n = 24) were both alcoholics and smokers. The most frequent bacteria in all CDC categories was Escherichia coli. Fourteen patients developed burst abdomen in the postoperative period and were excluded from the study. The mean duration of DPC increased with higher CDC categories, with CDC category 4 displaying the most extended mean duration at 10.70 days. The number of NPWT dressing changes increases with higher CDC categories, with CDC category 4 exhibiting the highest mean at 2.00 changes. The mean hospital stay increased with higher CDC categories, with CDC category 4 showing the most extended mean stay at 17.324 days. Statistical analysis revealed no significant association between SSI occurrence and CDC categories. Conclusions NPWT followed by DPC is a promising approach to managing gastrointestinal perforations, reducing SSIs, and potentially improving patient outcomes. However, further research is needed to explore the specific benefits of NPWT in conjunction with DPC and its efficacy in various clinical scenarios."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal trauma is a common cause of emergency department admission. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is the gold standard method for identifying intra-abdominal injuries in patients experiencing blunt trauma, especially those with high-energy trauma. Although the diagnostic accuracy of this imaging technique is very high, patient admission and prolonged observation protocols are still common practices worldwide. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of intra-abdominal injury in hemodynamically stable patients with high-energy blunt trauma and a normal abdominal CT scan at a Level-1 Trauma Center in Colombia, South America, to assess the relevance of a prolonged observation period. We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted to the emergency department for blunt trauma between 2021 and 2022. All consecutive patients with high-energy mechanisms of trauma and a normal CT scan at admission were included. Our primary outcomes were the incidence of intra-abdominal injury identified during a 24-hour observation period or hospital stay, ICU admission, and death. We included 480 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 33 (IQR 25.5, 47), and 74.2% were male. The most common mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle accidents (64.2%), falls from height (26%), and falls from bikes (3.1%). A total of 99.2% of patients had a Revised Trauma Score of 8. Only 1 patient (0.2%) (95% CI: 0.01-1.16) presented with an abdominal injury during the observation period. No ICU admissions or deaths were reported. The incidence of intra-abdominal injury in patients with hemodynamically stable blunt trauma and a negative abdominal CT scan is extremely low, and prolonged observation may not be justified in these patients."

The steel bar was successfully removed through an open surgical procedure by a multidisciplinary team. During the surgery, we found that the cervical vertebra, cervical spinal canal and cervical spinal cord were all severely injured. Postoperative CT demonstrated severe penetration of the cervical spinal canal but the patient returned to a fully functional level without any neurological deficits. Even with a serious cervical spinal canal penetrating trauma, the patient could resume normal work and life after appropriate treatment."

    "abstract": "The whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) procedure is increasingly common in evaluating patients presenting with high-energy trauma. However, it remains unclear in which population WBCT provides benefit and whether its routine application is truly beneficial. In this study, we aimed to compare physician predictions with WBCT findings in patients with high-energy blunt trauma. The study was conducted as a single-center prospective observational study at a tertiary center. Patients presenting with high-energy blunt trauma between 01.03.2021-01.03.2023 were included. Both physician predictions and WBCT findings were recorded and compared in three categories: \"no pathology,\" \"no life-threatening pathology,\" and \"life-threatening pathology.\" The predictive values of physician predictions for each category were calculated. The characteristics of patients evaluated as less severe than predicted by clinicians were examined. The study included a total of 92 patients. The median age was 27 years (IQR 25-75; 20-54). Among the patients, 27 (%) had life-threatening injuries according to CT findings in any region. A total of 34 (37%) patients were predicted by physicians to have \"no pathology\" in all three regions. Among these patients, none had life-threatening pathology in all three regions. There were 10 (10.9%) patients with CT findings more severe than physician predictions in at least one region. The sensitivity of physician predictions for life-threatening injury to the head/cervical region was 94.1% (95% CI: 71.3-99.9). For life-threatening injury to the chest, the sensitivity was 85.7% (95% CI: 42.1-99.6). For the presence of life-threatening abdominal pathology, the sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 63.1-100). CONCLUSıON: It appears reasonable to utilize WBCT in patients where physicians expect life-threatening injury in any system. However, in cases where no pathology is expected in any system according to clinical prediction, we believe that performing WBCT solely based on trauma mechanism will not provide sufficient benefit."

While it is generally safe and effective, a rare but potentially fatal complication known as acute gastric volvulus can occur following this procedure. A 28-year-old male, ten months post Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication presented with a one-day history of severe epigastric pain, abdominal distention, unproductive retching, and difficulty in breathing. Examination revealed tachypnea, subcutaneous emphysema and a tender distended abdomen. Imaging studies showed a left pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, and a grossly distended stomach. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed organoaxial gastric volvulus, necrosis of the greater curvature and gastric perforation. Partial gastrectomy and anterior gastropexy were performed. A left thoracostomy tube was placed to drain the left pneumothorax. He recovered fully post-operatively with complete resolution of all symptoms. Acute Gastric volvulus post Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication is attributed to adhesions, gastrostomy tubes, and foreign bodies like sutures. Life-threatening complications, such as gastric perforation, can ensue, underscoring the need for swift diagnosis and treatment. Acute gastric volvulus following Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication is a rare condition, and is difficult to diagnose. Given the steadily increasing rates of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplications performed in Uganda, maintaining a high index of suspicion is crucial for favorable patient outcomes among patients with this potentially fatal complication."

While maxillofacial fractures vary in location based on the mechanism of injury, the mandibular fracture is noted to be one of the most common facial fractures. The objective of this study was to explore the differences in injury patterns, outcomes, and demographics of isolated traumatic mandibular fractures between incarcerated and general populations. Methods This retrospective study analyzed consecutive patients presenting for trauma care from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2020, at the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center (ARMC). Patients 18 years and older were included in this study. Patients diagnosed with mandibular fracture as the primary diagnosis at admission and discharge were identified using the International Classification of Disease, Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9, ICD-10) Code. Patient demographics were extracted from their electronic medical records and included race, marital status, and insurance status. Results A total of 1080 patients with confirmed mandibular fractures were included in the final analysis. Among these patients, 87.5% (n=945) were males, 40% (n=432) of the patients were Hispanic, and the average age was 31.55 years old. The most common mechanism of injury was blunt trauma secondary to assault. Compared to the general population with mandibular fracture, the incarcerated patients with mandibular fracture were more likely to be males (96.1% vs 86.1% for incarcerated population vs. general population respectively, p=0.0005). No other variables were statistically different between these two groups. Conclusion The evidence from this study suggests that the patterns, outcomes, and demographics of mandibular fracture in both incarcerated and general populations are similar."

One of the prominent causes is malignant effusion. The patient is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history of Crohn's disease, melanoma status post-resection, and osteoarthritis. She presented with complaints of abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath on exertion, and lower extremity swelling for the past 2-3 days. She was recently discharged four days before this visit after being treated for a viral infection. A physical examination was significant for tachycardia, muffled heart sounds, abdominal distention, and bilateral lower extremity swelling. Labs were in the normal range except for elevated liver enzymes and sodium of 130 mmol/L. A chest X-ray revealed a small bilateral effusion; a bedside echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction greater than 70% and a large pericardial effusion >2 cm, consistent with cardiac tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed with the drainage of 250 milliliters of hemorrhagic fluid, which was sent for diagnostic studies. Post-procedure echo on the next day showed an EF of 35-40% and no recurrent pericardial effusion. The workup for connective tissue disease was negative except for elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA). CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed gastric wall thickening with no solid organ mass. Her pericardial fluid studies were consistent with exudative etiology and positive for atypical lymphoid cells, leading to the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Malignant pericardial effusion is common due to solid organ malignancy; however, it is rare with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We present an intriguing case where pericardial effusion was the precursor to the eventual diagnosis of DLBCL, highlighting the complexity and diverse manifestations of this lymphoma subtype."

It was associated with metastatic lesions in the brain. Metastasis from the lung carcinoma in the jejunum is a very rare condition predisposing to small intestinal perforation which is also associated with brain metastasis."

    "abstract": "Fewer than 200 cases of Perforated Duodenal Diverticulum (\"PDD\") have been reported in the literature. The percentage of caused by trauma is generally very low and similar to rates recorded for duodenal injuries caused by trauma in the absence of diverticula (3 %-5 %). As a rare cause of abdominal pain after trauma, perforated duodenal diverticula are seldom diagnosed preoperatively. Despite preoperative CT scan demonstrating duodenal perforation, a diverticular origin is often only identified intraoperatively. A 36-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with severe upper abdominal pain that began after blunt trauma by a kick to his upper abdomen during a fight. A duodenal injury was identified by CT. Exploratory laparotomy then revealed a retroperitoneal perforation of a diverticulum located at the second segment of the duodenum. A review of the literature found few cases reporting perforated duodenal diverticulum secondary to trauma. Most cases identified the diverticulum at intraoperative exploration, with most approaches being through open surgery. Perforation of a duodenal diverticulum secondary to trauma is an extremely rare event, which is why it is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. As the presenting signs are often suggestive of duodenal perforation without a clear notion of duodenal diverticula at CT scan, a surgical approach and exploration is most frequently described. In our experience, the management of traumatic PDD aligns with the literature favoring the open surgical approach."

    "abstract": "Urachal anomalies are rare and can present with various clinical manifestations. Urachal remnants, in particular, can be difficult to diagnose because of atypical symptoms at presentation. This study reports a case of intestinal obstruction in an infant secondary to an infected urachal cyst. A 3-month-old boy with a known febrile urinary tract infection developed acute abdominal distension. Abdominal ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) revealed a nonspecific, ill-defined soft tissue density at the mid-abdomen, associated with intestinal obstruction. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. The site of the obstruction was found to be at the mid-small bowel; the proximal small bowel was markedly distended, and the small bowel and sigmoid colon were adherent to urachal remnant. The urachal remnant was excised, and the peritoneal adhesions were lysed. The day after surgery, the patient was discharged without any complications. Intestinal obstruction is an exceedingly rare presentation of urachal remnants. This case highlights that urachal anomalies should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with intestinal obstruction and a concurrent febrile urinary tract infection."

    "abstract": "Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) of the pancreas are rare neoplasms, accounting for only 1 %-2 % of all pancreatic tumors, and predominantly affect female patients. The present case report details a patient presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain for 3 days who ultimately received a diagnosis of SPNs in the pancreatic body and tail. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a sizable mass arising from the pancreas, featuring an enhancing cystic component with involvement of the liver and spleen. The patient underwent subsequent exploratory laparotomy, a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and partial hepatectomy. SPN diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry with negative resection margins. Approximately 70 % of SPN cases are asymptomatic and are incidentally discovered. Despite advances in diagnostic modalities, preoperative diagnosis of SPNs remains a clinical challenge. Surgical management with negative resection margins remains the primary treatment approach. The recurrence rate after surgical resection has been reported to be 3 %-9 %. The prognosis for SPNs limited to the pancreas is generally favorable, with a cure rate exceeding 95 % after complete surgical resection. An SPN of the pancreas is a rare tumor observed in young female patients. Although it is classified as a malignant tumor, SPN has low malignant potential. Aggressive surgical resection, however, has proven effective in curing SPN for the majority of patients."

Current diagnostic modalities including plain radiography, computed tomography (CT), and the saline load test (SLT) have advantages and disadvantages. Point-of-care-ultrasonography (POCUS) offers a possible timely, low-cost, and efficient alternative method of diagnosing TAK. In this case series we present three cases where POCUS was used to diagnose TAK in the ED. Three patients in their early 20s presented to the ED complaining of knee trauma with wounds in proximity to the joint. Mechanisms of injury included a gunshot wound in one case and blunt trauma (motor vehicle collision and bicycle crash) in two cases. In all three cases TAK was suggested on POCUS examinations by the presence of intra-articular hyperechoic foci consistent with air artifact. All three cases had TAK confirmed by orthopedic evaluation. Ultrasound may have utility in the evaluation of patients presenting with knee trauma where TAK is a concern. The SLT is generally considered the gold standard test for diagnosis of TAK, but it is invasive and has a wide range of diagnostic accuracy. Intra-articular air has been found to be a sensitive marker for TAK in CT studies. Thus, additional investigations into the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for this finding should be undertaken."

    "abstract": "The most common cancer among females worldwide and in Saudi Arabia is breast cancer. Lobular breast carcinoma is the second most common subtype of breast cancer. There are different patterns of metastasis as ductal breast cancer spreads to the liver, lung, brain, and bone while the lobular subtype metastasizes to the gastrointestinal tract. A 69-year-old Indian pilgrim presented to the ER complaining of abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distention admitted as a case of intestinal obstruction. CT scan demonstrated intestinal obstruction with transition zone at the terminal ileum. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy where she was found to have a mass at the terminal ileum. Resection of around 8 cm of small bowel and primary anastomosis were done, histopathology revealed metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. Patients with metastatic breast cancer to the gastrointestinal tract often present with nonspecific symptoms, while acute cases present with complications such as perforation. In a retrospective review of metastatic breast cancer, the majority metastasizes to the colon and rectum, while 19 % to the small bowel. Palliative surgery is considered the first-line treatment of complicated patients, while stable cases are referred to medical oncology. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer leading to death and lobular subtype has more propensity to metastasize to the gastrointestinal tract compared to ductal breast cancer. Regarding patients presenting to the emergency bay, treating the emergency complaints is the standard management. For immigrant patients, we highly recommend creating a data system for sending histopathology reports to facilitate follow-up in their countries. A 69-year-old Indian pilgrim patient presented to the ER complaining of abdominal pain for 3 days associated with nausea and vomiting, not passing stool nor flatus was admitted as a case of intestinal obstruction. On examination patient was in pain with tachycardia, abdominal distended with generalized tenderness. Labs revealed metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia. Abdomen X-ray showed signs of intestinal obstruction with multiple air-fluid levels and dilated small bowel loops. CT scan abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast reported (Figs. 1,2) distended ileum around 5 cm proximal to the transition zone at the terminal ileum with mild free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy where she was found to have a mass at the terminal ileum with the proximal loop dilated and distal loops collapsed, and further exploration showed enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Small bowel resection of around 8 cm and side to side anastomosis was done to relive the intestinal obstruction. Gross pathology showed a solid lesion protruding into the lumen measuring 1.5*1.5*1.5 cm, while the microscopic description consists of small cells with round ovoid nuclei which lack cohesion and appear individually dispersed through a fibrous connective tissue and arranged in single file linear cords that invade the stroma (Fig. 4) concluded as metastatic lobular carcinoma of the breast. Immunohistochemistry reported CK7 + ve, ER + ve, EMA + ve and CKAE1/AE3 + ve. The patient had an uneventful recovery, then she was discharged against medical advice and traveled to her country after two days before the histopathology result and she lost follow-up with us."

    "abstract": "Following the rupture of a coronary artery, a patient's condition usually deteriorates rapidly due to cardiac tamponade. A pseudoaneurysm due to a coronary artery rupture is rare; however, when a spontaneous coronary artery pseudoaneurysm occurs without tamponade, it creates a fistula in the right ventricle, often requiring surgical repair. This report describes the case of a 68-year-old man who presented with chest discomfort after a 12-day course of antibiotic treatment for bacteremia. Following coronary angiography, echocardiography, and enhanced computed tomography, he was diagnosed with a right coronary artery pseudoaneurysm accompanied with perforation of the right ventricle. Severe adhesions were observed during emergency surgery surrounding the entire heart. The patient presented with risk factors for coronary artery disease, including hypertension and smoking history. His coronary artery was severely calcified due to end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis; thus, a covered stent could not fit inside the arterial lumen. Consequently, coronary artery bypass grafting to the right coronary artery and right ventricle repair were performed. Unfortunately, the patient died postoperatively due to sepsis from intestinal translocation. This rare development was hypothesized to be an incidental result of the combination of severe post-inflammatory adhesions, extensive coronary artery calcification, and rupture of the calcification crevices. In the case of a severe post-inflammatory response, shock without cardiac tamponade may require further scrutiny by assuming the possibility of inward rupture. For patients in poor condition, two-stage surgical treatment might be considered after stabilization with a covered stent."

This is a case of a four-and-a-half-year-old male child who presented with features of obstruction, which, on further evaluation, revealed ileoileal intussusception. An emergency surgical intervention was planned with an exploratory laparotomy and a reduction of intussusception. This case emphasizes the urgency of diagnosing and managing intussusception to prevent serious consequences such as bowel ischemia, bowel necrosis, bowel perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis. It stands as a stark reminder for medical professionals to stay vigilant for these critical gastrointestinal emergencies, and immediate treatment with a multidisciplinary approach is recommended to significantly enhance patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis that requires prompt treatment. While radiotherapy may enhance survival when superior vena cava syndrome is present, radiation therapy-induced pericardial disease can be a potential complication. A 55-year-old man, who recently underwent radiotherapy for stage IV small-cell lung cancer complicated by superior vena cava syndrome, presented with chest pain and dyspnea. In the emergency room, he was dyspneic, hypotensive, and tachycardic. Pulmonary auscultation revealed the absence of lung sounds on the right. The initial electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in lateral leads and in lead DII, with reciprocal changes in lead DIII. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram revealed cardiac tamponade and emergent pericardiocentesis was performed, removing 500 ml of purulent fluid, resulting in an immediate clinical improvement. Thoracentesis was also performed, showing no empyema. Large spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy was started. Cultures from the pericardial fluid and peripheral blood grew multi-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cytological analysis of the pericardial fluid was consistent with infection. The patient improved after 2 weeks of targeted antibiotic therapy and underwent the first cycle of chemotherapy. He was discharged with an early scheduled pulmonology appointment. Although the most common causes of pericardial effusion in lung cancer are malignant, non-malignant etiologies should also be considered. This patient had an infectious pericardial effusion most probably due to a pericardial-mediastinal mass fistula caused by radiotherapy. This was a diagnostic challenge, both in the emergency room as well in the inpatient setting. Small cell lung cancer is a fast-growing cancer that exhibits aggressive behavior.In patients with lung cancer, malignant pericardial effusions are more common than non-malignant ones.Purulent pericardial effusions, especially those due to lung cancer, are rare in developed countries with very few reports in the literature."

We aim to assess trauma care value for patients who underwent urgent laparotomies (LAP) and thoracotomies (THO) in our Health Network System. Clinical variables (v = 84) from trauma patients (>18 yo) were retrieved retrospectively (Jan-2010 to July-2016) and prospectively (Aug-2016 to Sept-2021) from a Health System warehouse under IRB-approved protocols. Patients were divided according to their Injury Severity Score (ISS) into mild/moderate cases (ISS <15) and severe cases (ISS >15). Value was assessed using quality and cost domains. Quality surrogates included graded postoperative complications (PCs), length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission (RA), patient satisfaction (PS), and textbook (TB) cases. Total charges (TCs) and reimbursement index (RI) were included as surrogates for cost. Value domains were displayed in scorecards comparing Observed (O) with Expected (E) (using the ACS risk calculator) outcomes. Uni-/multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS. 41,927 trauma evaluations were performed, leading to 16 044 admissions, with 528 (3.2%) patients requiring urgent surgical procedures (LAP = 413 and THO = 115). Although the M:F ratio (7:3) was similar in LAP vs THO groups, age and BMI were significantly different (41.8 ± 19.1 vs 51.8 ± 19.9 years, 28.6 ± 9.9 vs 27.4 ± 7 Kg/m2, respectively, P < .05). Blunt trauma was involved in 68.8/77.3% of the LAP/THO procedures, respectively (P < .05). Multivariate analyses showed ISS, age, ASA class, and medical center as factors significantly predicting PC (P < .05). Postoperative complication grades from the LAP/THO groups showed above-average outcomes; nonetheless, LOS was higher than the national averages. The Trauma Program holds high value in our Health Network System. Protocols for decreasing LOS are being implemented."

    "abstract": "Cervical spine injuries in children are uncommon but potentially devastating; however, indiscriminate neck imaging after trauma unnecessarily exposes children to ionising radiation. The aim of this study was to derive and validate a paediatric clinical prediction rule that can be incorporated into an algorithm to guide radiographic screening for cervical spine injury among children in the emergency department. In this prospective observational cohort study, we screened children aged 0-17 years presenting with known or suspected blunt trauma at 18 specialised children's emergency departments in hospitals in the USA affiliated with the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). Injured children were eligible for enrolment into derivation or validation cohorts by fulfilling one of the following criteria: transported from the scene of injury to the emergency department by emergency medical services; evaluated by a trauma team; and undergone neck imaging for concern for cervical spine injury either at or before arriving at the PECARN-affiliated emergency department. Children presenting with solely penetrating trauma were excluded. Before viewing an enrolled child's neck imaging results, the attending emergency department clinician completed a clinical examination and prospectively documented cervical spine injury risk factors in an electronic questionnaire. Cervical spine injuries were determined by imaging reports and telephone follow-up with guardians within 21-28 days of the emergency room encounter, and cervical spine injury was confirmed by a paediatric neurosurgeon. Factors associated with a high risk of cervical spine injury (>10%) were identified by bivariable Poisson regression with robust error estimates, and factors associated with non-negligible risk were identified by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Variables were combined in the cervical spine injury prediction rule. The primary outcome of interest was cervical spine injury within 28 days of initial trauma warranting inpatient observation or surgical intervention. Rule performance measures were calculated for both derivation and validation cohorts. A clinical care algorithm for determining which risk factors warrant radiographic screening for cervical spine injury after blunt trauma was applied to the study population to estimate the potential effect on reducing CT and x-ray use in the paediatric emergency department. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05049330. Nine emergency departments participated in the derivation cohort, and nine participated in the validation cohort. In total, 22 430 children presenting with known or suspected blunt trauma were enrolled (11 857 children in the derivation cohort; 10 573 in the validation cohort). 433 (1·9%) of the total population had confirmed cervical spine injuries. The following factors were associated with a high risk of cervical spine injury: altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 3-8 or unresponsive on the Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive scale [AVPU] of consciousness); abnormal airway, breathing, or circulation findings; and focal neurological deficits including paresthesia, numbness, or weakness. Of 928 in the derivation cohort presenting with at least one of these risk factors, 118 (12·7%) had cervical spine injury (risk ratio 8·9 [95% CI 7·1-11·2]). The following factors were associated with non-negligible risk of cervical spine injury by CART analysis: neck pain; altered mental status (GCS score of 9-14; verbal or pain on the AVPU; or other signs of altered mental status); substantial head injury; substantial torso injury; and midline neck tenderness. The high-risk and CART-derived factors combined and applied to the validation cohort performed with 94·3% (95% CI 90·7-97·9) sensitivity, 60·4% (59·4-61·3) specificity, and 99·9% (99·8-100·0) negative predictive value. Had the algorithm been applied to all participants to guide the use of imaging, we estimated the number of children having CT might have decreased from 3856 (17·2%) to 1549 (6·9%) of 22 430 children without increasing the number of children getting plain x-rays. Incorporated into a clinical algorithm, the cervical spine injury prediction rule showed strong potential for aiding clinicians in determining which children arriving in the emergency department after blunt trauma should undergo radiographic neck imaging for potential cervical spine injury. Implementation of the clinical algorithm could decrease use of unnecessary radiographic testing in the emergency department and eliminate high-risk radiation exposure. Future work should validate the prediction rule and care algorithm in more general settings such as community emergency departments.

The team used video laryngoscopy (VL) to secure the airway; however, continuous bloody secretions increased the complexity of the procedure and required the application of the Suction-Assisted Laryngoscopy and Airway Decontamination (SALAD) method to facilitate intubation. By utilizing the SALAD procedure, the field of view on the VL camera remained unobscured, and the patient's airway remained clear, allowing for an uneventful intubation procedure. No episodes of hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia, or obvious clinical signs of pulmonary aspiration occurred during the procedure. The patient was transported to a local Pediatric Level I trauma center, where he underwent emergent surgery to repair an esophageal laceration and was discharged to home 40 days later. This case highlights the importance of deliberate and proactive management of the contaminated airway in the prehospital setting. The SALAD technique replaces the Yankauer suction catheter with a larger bore suction catheter in conjunction with VL to perform gross decontamination of the mouth and airway before attempting intubation. This is followed by permanently placing the large bore suction catheter under constant suction in the posterior pharynx or esophagus to keep the VL camera unobscured by vomit or blood to facilitate intubation. After the intubation, the suction catheter may be removed unless ongoing suction is required. Keeping the VL camera unobscured during the procedure may improve first-pass intubation success rate."

It is best diagnosed using computed tomography angiography and typically treated using endovascular embolization and, in some cases, open or laparoscopic surgery. In this report, we present a case of a ruptured mycotic splenic artery pseudoaneurysm containing Histoplasma capsulatum, which to our knowledge is the first case to report a mycotic splenic artery pseudoaneurysm of this nature. We report a case of a 42-year-old white male with past medical history of Hepatitis C and IV drug abuse who presented to the Emergency Department with a 24-h history of severe diffuse abdominal pain. He was tachycardic and peritonitic on exam. Work-up demonstrated leukocytosis and lactic acidosis. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast showed hemoperitoneum and active extravasation of contrast from the splenic artery into the splenic hilum, associated with a surrounding hematoma measuring 5.3 × 5.0 cm, concerning for ruptured splenic artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient was taken emergently for exploratory laparotomy, where a large intraperitoneal hematoma was evacuated. A ruptured splenic artery pseudoaneurysm was identified, isolated, and controlled, followed by completion splenectomy. Final pathology demonstrated a 3.0 × 1.3 × 0.3 cm pseudoaneurysm wall and a 14 × 9.5 × 5.5 cm spleen containing multiple necrotizing granulomata positive for the presence of Histoplasmosis species. The patient recovered appropriately and was discharged on post-operative day five. This case demonstrates a successful approach to a ruptured mycotic splenic artery pseudoaneurysm resulting in a positive outcome. It is a unique case as it highlights, to our knowledge, the first report of splenic artery aneurysm secondary to Histoplasma capsulatum infection. This report helps further the understanding of the pathophysiology as well as the natural history of mycotic splenic pseudoaneurysms."

A young male was taken to the emergency room of a local hospital after six hours abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) shows intestinal volvulus and exploratory laparotomy was performed. Postoperative CT revealed remission of small intestinal torsion and congenital malrotation of the midgut. The patient vomited frequently within 48 h after the surgery, and was transferred to our hospital for conservative treatment. After 4 days of conservative treatment, the vomiting symptoms were relieved at first, but worsened again after a liquid diet. CT showed complete duodenal obstruction and exploratory laparotomy was performed again. Congenital malrotation was found, which resulted in midgut volvulus and duodenal obstruction due to anomalous fixation of the mesentery. The bowel was placed in normal anatomical position, and the mesentery was sutured to the posterior abdominal wall. The patient was followed up for 24 months with no complaints. Due to the rare incidence and atypical pain clinical manifestations, it is difficult for the congenital malrotation in adults to be diagnosed. Midgut volvulus in adults with malrotation is even rarer and requires emergency operation, and may be misdiagnosed. Midgut volvulus with midgut malrotation is very rare in adults.

Exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing an inflammatory block in the hypogastrium, whose dissection revealed inner purulent collection and the appearance of jejunal diverticulitis, a diagnosis confirmed by histopathological examination. Segmental resection of the jejunum with double-layer terminal-terminal enteroenteric anastomosis, lavage, and drainage was performed. The evolution was favorable. Based on our brief review, the diagnosis of complicated jejunal diverticulosis is difficult and sometimes not accurately established, even by high-resolution imaging techniques, with diagnostic laparotomy being necessary for these situations. Surgical treatment should be considered before severe complications develop."

    "abstract": "A jejunal intussusception as a presentation of retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RLPS) is a rare occurrence. The majority of RLPS are presented as an abdominal mass, however, having a jejunal obstruction is an interesting case. The aim is to describe the management of jejunal intussusception secondary to atypical lipomatous tumours with concurrent RLPS. A 61-year-old lady presented with a sudden onset of intestinal obstruction with 1 month of constitutional symptoms and an enlarging right lumbar mass. Computed tomography showed a small bowel intussusception with diffuse peritoneal and retroperitoneal lipomatosis. Emergency exploratory laparotomy, segmental bowel resection, and partial excision of intraperitoneal mesenteric lipoma were performed. A stage En-bloc resection of the RLPS and right nephrectomy was done later. However, she refused for subsequent surgery. A complete resection is the gold standard in managing RLPS. In this report, the management is rendered not to the standard as the patient first presented with intestinal obstruction requiring emergency reduction with a piecemeal resection. A stage surgery was required to determine a promising prognosis, but the patient refused such surgery. A small bowel intussusception in adults is rare but is mostly caused by a tumor or neoplasm. Early recognition of the complexity of the case should be preempted and referred to the tertiary team for further definitive surgery. Patient exhaustion from the subsequent surgery might hamper the only management available for the case."

    "abstract": "This report describes a case of transmural migration of a gossypiboma from the peritoneum into the urinary bladder in a 4-year-old, female spayed, mixed-breed dog. The dog was presented on an emergency basis for complete urethral obstruction with radiographic evidence of urocystolithiasis. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and a 4-5 cm mass was identified which was confluent with the apex of the urinary bladder. The mass and bladder were exteriorized and isolated, and an apical, partial cystectomy was performed to remove the mass and gain access to the uroliths within the lumen of the bladder. A 4×4 surgical sponge was identified within the trigone of the bladder, it had multiple uroliths; another sponge was also found within the mass itself. This case demonstrates an atypical cause of urethral obstruction and serves as the first reported case of transmural migration of a gossypiboma into the urinary bladder of a dog. It also illustrates the importance of establishing routine operating procedures including gauze counts and the use of radiopaque-labeled surgical gauze."

    "abstract": "To describe a dog with suspected cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS) secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). A 2-month-old intact male Chihuahua-American Pitbull Terrier mix weighing 1.94 kg presented to a veterinary teaching emergency room after suffering bite wound-penetrating trauma to the head. Treatment was initiated with hyperosmotic agents, fluid resuscitation, and analgesia. The dog's neurologic dysfunction warranted hospitalization and continuous monitoring. Within 24 hours, the dog developed hyponatremia (133 mmol/L compared to 143 mmol/L on presentation [reference interval 142-149 mmol/L]). As the dog had concurrent tachycardia, increase in urine sodium concentration, polyuria, and weight loss, a diagnosis of cerebral salt wasting was suspected. A 2% hypertonic saline constant rate infusion was administered for volume replacement, and the patient showed improvement in clinical signs and blood sodium concentration. The dog was discharged on Day 5. Recheck examination showed significant neurologic improvement with sodium just below the low end of the reference range (141 mmol/L [reference interval 142-149 mmol/L]). This is the first description of suspected CSWS in veterinary medicine. Hyponatremia is a common finding in critically ill neurologic people, including those with TBI, and is typically associated with either syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone or CSWS. As treatment recommendations for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and CSWS are diametrically opposed, identifying the presence of hyponatremia and distinguishing between these 2 clinical entities is critical for improving patient care for those with TBI. This case highlights the characteristics and clinical progression regarding the diagnosis and management of suspected CSWS."

    "abstract": "Down syndrome often coincides with hypothyroidism, a condition that may lead to pericardial effusion (PE), though cardiac tamponade remains an infrequent complication. Cardiac tamponade is an emergency that requires immediate diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present a case of a patient who presented to the emergency department (ED) with Down syndrome associated with hypothyroidism and underwent immediate pericardiocentesis and pericardial window placement. A 52-year-old male, with a history of Down's syndrome and hypothyroidism, presented to the ED complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain. He had previously been diagnosed with PE. On examination, he exhibited average heart rate, low blood pressure, decreased heart sounds, and jugular venous distention, with no murmur or frictional rub. Initial investigations revealed normal sinus rhythm on EKG but an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray. Laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate, suggestive of inflammation, while arterial blood gas showed compensated respiratory alkalosis. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated. Despite supplemental oxygen, the patient's condition worsened, prompting a bedside ultrasound revealing cardiac tamponade. A cardiology consultation recommended immediate transfer for treatment. At a different hospital, pericardiocentesis was performed, followed by the placement of a pericardial window to prevent recurrence. Follow-up imaging showed improvement in pleural effusion and resolution of cardiac tamponade. The patient's symptoms improved, and he was discharged with regular follow-up. Down's syndrome is a chromosomal disorder characterized by the trisomy of chromosome 21. It is associated with various cardiac complications. Such patients have an elevated risk of PE due to a variety of reasons, such as viral infections, hypothyroidism, or autoimmune diseases. Although PE has been found, the incidence of cardiac tamponade has rarely been reported. The pathogenesis of PE in hypothyroidism is due to the leakage of fluids from the capillaries and the build-up of fluid in the pericardial space. The treatment of PE is treating hypothyroidism with thyroxine. In rare cases like ours, when the patient develops cardiac tamponade, the patient often needs pericardiocentesis. Our patient had to undergo pericardial window placement, as well to prevent recurrent symptoms. In conclusion, this case report sheds light on the occurrence of cardiac tamponade in a patient with Down's syndrome and hypothyroidism, a relatively rare complication that necessitates prompt recognition and intervention. Through this report, we emphasize the importance of considering cardiac tamponade in the differential diagnosis of patients with Down's syndrome presenting with symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular compromise."

    "abstract": "Adult intussusception is an infrequent occurrence typically resulting from an identifiable lead point of a benign or malignant etiology. Here, we present a case of a 19-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain, intractable nausea, and fluctuations between bloody diarrhea and constipation. These symptoms had begun two months prior and had increased in severity, resulting in significant appetite changes. An abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan without contrast was obtained, which showed evidence of intussusception of the ileocecum into the transverse colon with resultant small bowel obstruction. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which resulted in a partial ileocolectomy due to the presence of a 6.8 cm cecal mass with palpable mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The pathologic specimen was identified as Burkitt lymphoma based on a combination of histologic, immunohistochemical, and fluorescence in situ hybridization findings. Currently, the patient is undergoing three cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine (R-CODOX-M/IVAC) per Magrath protocol for low-risk Burkitt lymphoma."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal trauma is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits, and spleen and splenic vasculature is involved variably in those cases. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysm formation is one complication with potentially devastating consequences. Early detection and management are of paramount importance given its potential fatality. Management includes open repair with or without splenectomy, and endovascular approach. The minimally invasive endovascular treatment offers earlier recovery, preserved splenic function, and positive outcomes. We report a case of delayed presentation of a large splenic artery pseudoaneurysm after blunt abdominal trauma, managed using endovascular intervention. A 45-year-old male presented 10 days after being involved in a pedestrian accident with blunt abdominal trauma resulting in a large splenic artery pseudoaneurysm. After multidisciplinary discussion, the decision was to take him for endovascular treatment. The patient recovered very well and was discharged two days later and followed up in an outpatient setting. Over a year, he became symptom free, and demonstrated radiological finding of shrinking pseudoaneurysm. Pseudoaneurysms of visceral arteries are repaired regardless of their size per society of vascular surgery guidelines. Larger ones are at higher risk of rupture and are associated with high mortality. When discovered, treatment plans should be readily discussed, and undertaken. In our case, the patient had a 6.5 cm splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, and a multidisciplinary meeting was conducted and concluded that endovascular treatment would be the best modality to start with, with surgical option as a backup in a hybrid room setting. Blunt abdominal trauma can present with overt symptoms of internal organ injury; however, some might be missed and need high index of suspicion and therefore further testing and imaging. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysms can expand and rupture in delayed presentation, early detection and management is of paramount importance. Endovascular treatment represents an excellent modality, with minimal invasive nature, faster recovery, and early return to daily activity with preserved splenic function."

    "abstract": "Perforation by pacemaker leads, although rare, is a complication reported since the introduction of pacemaker therapy. Although historically reported frequencies were as high as 5%, recent reports have cited frequencies ranging from 1 to 2%. We report a case where a screw-type atrial lead slightly penetrated the right atrial wall, causing chronic abrasion of the ascending aorta, resulting in shock. A 54-year-old male presented with dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed at 40 years of age when he developed decompensated heart failure. Despite ongoing treatment, his heart failure worsened, leading to hospitalization at the age of 54. During his hospital stay, he experienced cardiac arrest that required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, followed by a return of spontaneous circulation. He was subsequently transferred to our institution after initiation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 25%, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of 60 mm, and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Transcatheter mitral valve repair was performed to treat severe MR, followed by implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D). Three months later, the patient was brought to our emergency department by ambulance because of hypotension. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade, necessitating emergency pericardial decompression via left fourth intercostal mini-thoracotomy and drain placement. Upon transfer to the intensive care unit, 1200 mL of blood was drained from the chest tube, prompting a return to the operating room for a median sternotomy. It was discovered that the pacemaker lead on the left side of the right atrium had slowly eroded into the aorta, leading to perforation. The ascending aorta was repaired and hemostasis was achieved; the patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 18. The pacemaker lead perforated the right atrium; chronic abrasion of the lead against the ascending aorta resulted in bleeding from the ascending aorta 3 months later."

It is used in combat and prehospital medicine when definitive measures are often not available or ideal. It can temporarily relieve increased intrathoracic pressure and treat a collapsed lung or great vessel obstruction. However, when done incorrectly, it can result in underlying visceral organ and vessel trauma. This is a case of an adult male who presented to the emergency department after sustaining multiple stab wounds during an altercation. On arrival, the patient had a 14-gauge angiocatheter inserted at the 4th intercostal space (ICS), left of the parasternal line traversing the right ventricle and interventricular septum and terminating in the left ventricle.

    "abstract": "Hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is a zoonotic infection prevalent in specific regions, including Tunisia. Complications are rare but potentially life-threatening. This case report highlights the significance of early diagnosis and intervention in a unique case where anaphylaxis resulted from minor abdominal trauma in a 17-year-old male with an undiagnosed hydatid cyst. The patient arrived at the emergency department with syncope and hypotension after a classroom accident. Physical examination showed an urticarial rash and abdominal tenderness. Anaphylactic shock was diagnosed and promptly treated. A computed tomography scan confirmed a ruptured liver hydatid cyst. The patient received anthelmintic treatment and underwent conservative surgical management. Intraoperatively, a second anaphylactic shock occurred and was promptly treated. The post-operative course was uneventful, and histopathological analysis identified Echinococcus granulosus. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing hydatid disease as a potential cause of anaphylaxis post-trauma, even in asymptomatic patients. Early diagnosis through imaging is crucial for prompt intervention. Surgical management should be considered, with conservative approaches favored in acute cases. Post-surgical albendazole treatment is essential to prevent recurrence. This report serves as a valuable reference for healthcare professionals, highlighting the need for heightened clinical suspicion in cases like this. It underscores the significance of considering hydatid cyst rupture in the differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis following blunt trauma. Awareness among pediatricians, emergency physicians, and primary care providers can lead to early diagnosis and better patient outcomes, preventing severe complications or fatalities associated with this rare condition."

    "abstract": "While follow-up CT and prophylactic embolization with angiography are often conducted during non-operative management (NOM) for BLSI, particularly in a high-grade injury, the utility of early repeated CT for preventing unexpected hemorrhage remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate whether early follow-up computerized tomography (CT) within 7 days after admission would decrease unexpected hemostatic procedures on pediatric blunt liver and spleen injury (BLSI). A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter observational cohort study on pediatric patients with BLSI (2008-2019) was conducted on those who underwent NOM, in whom the timing of follow-up CT were decided by treating physicians. The incidence of unexpected hemostatic procedure (laparotomy and/or emergency angiography for ruptured pseudoaneurysm) and complications related to BLSI were compared between patients with and without early follow-up CT within 7 days. Inverse probability weighting with propensity scores adjusted patient demographics, comorbidities, mechanism and severity of injury, initial resuscitation, and institutional characteristics. Among 1320 included patients, 552 underwent early follow-up CT. Approximately 25% of patients underwent angiography on the day of admission. The incidence of unexpected hemostasis was similar between patients with and without early repeat CT (8 [1.4%] vs. 6 [0.8%]; adjusted OR, 1.44 [0.62-3.34]; p = 0.40). Patients with repeat CT scans more frequently underwent multiple angiographies (OR, 2.79 [1.32-5.88]) and had more complications related to BLSI, particularly bile leak (OR, 1.73 [1.04-2.87]). Follow-up CT scans within 7 days was not associated with reduced unexpected hemostasis in NOM for pediatric BLSI."

    "abstract": "Objective: The preliminary results was reported regarding the treatment of mesenteric torsion by mesenteric fixation in the last decade, especially preventing recurrence of mesenteric torsion by mesenteric fan-shaped fixation. Methods: We selected 12 patients who received emergency operation in Chongqing Hospital of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine from December 2010 to March 2022. All of them were made a definite diagnose of mesenteric torsion by the preoperative CT scan or exploratory laparotomy. The recurrence of mesenteric torsion will be prevented by taking the operation of mesenteric fan-shaped fixation. This technique is suitable for the patient who is suffering total mesenteric torsion, but enteric necrosis is excluded affirmatively. The operation is consists of the following progress: (1) Exploratory laparotomy to check for necrosis of the bowel and for lesions other than torsion. (2) Mesenteric torsion derotation.(3) Mesenteric linear fixation; the right posterior lower border of the small mesentery (terminal ileal mesentery) is intermittently sutured to the posterior peritoneum of the right lower quadrant to increase the width of the base of the small mesentery. (4) Mesenteric fan-shaped fixation, which is fan-shaped to the lower left and fixed in the posterior peritoneum, shortening the length of the mesentery and further increasing the width of the mesentery and posterior peritoneal fixation. Results: A total of 12 patients with mesenteric torsion were treated by operation for 15 times in all. Among them, 3 cases received resection of most small bowel were performed without recurrence; 3 patients received only derotation for a total of 4 times, 2 cases recurred, 1 of them recurred twice; 4 cases underwent derotation and mesenteric linear fixation,and 1 case recurred. Four patients with derotation and mesenteric fan-shaped fixation recovered well without recurrence. Conclusion: Mesenteric fan-shaped fixation may be an effective operative type to reduce or avoid postoperative recurrence of mesenteric torsion. 目的： 报告本团队近10年开展小肠系膜固定术治疗小肠系膜扭转的初步结果，重点介绍小肠系膜扇形固定术预防小肠系膜扭转复发的情况。 方法： 对广州中医药大学第一附属医院重庆医院2010年12月至2022年3月期间的12例术前急诊CT确诊或剖腹探查确诊为全小肠系膜扭转患者，行小肠系膜扇形固定术预防小肠系膜扭转复发。该技术适应证为术前急诊CT确诊或剖腹探查确诊为全小肠系膜扭转患者，经系膜扭转复位后小肠系膜及肠管无坏死的病例。小肠系膜扇形固定术包括以下4个部分：（1）剖腹探查，检查肠管有无坏死以及除扭转外有无其他病变；（2）肠扭转复位；（3）小肠系膜线性固定，将小肠系膜的右后下缘（末端回肠系膜）间断缝合固定于右下腹的后腹膜，增加小肠系膜根部的宽度；（4）小肠系膜扇形固定，将小肠系膜向左下方扇形展开，呈扇形固定于后腹膜，缩短系膜长度并进一步增加系膜与后腹膜固定的宽度。 结果： 12例患者共施行15次小肠系膜扭转手术。其中行小肠大部分切除3例，无复发；单纯性肠扭转复位术3例共4次，2例复发，其中1例2次复发；肠扭转复位+线性固定术4例，1例复发；肠扭转复位+小肠系膜扇形固定术4例，无复发。 结论： 小肠系膜扇形固定术可能是降低或避免术后复发的一种有效治疗方式。."

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics of injuries associated with penetrating violence across a German metropolitan region over a 5-year period. In the retrospective study, a database query of the control center of the Düsseldorf rescue service area was used to identify and descriptively analyze all rescue service operations with penetrating violence-associated injuries in the years 2015, 2017, and 2019. For those patients who were transferred to the major trauma center, a further analysis of the in-hospital course was performed. In the 3 years 2015, 2017 and 2019 a total of 266 patients (age: 33 ± 14 years, male: 79%) could be recorded (2015 vs. 2017 vs. 2019: n = 81 vs. n = 93 vs. n = 92, respectively). The most common age group involved had an age range of 15-34 years. A particularly higher frequency of emergency calls was found for the areas of Old Town, City Center, and one other district (Oberbilk). A high frequency of rescue missions was found in the nights from Saturday to Sunday between 20.00 p.m. and 04.00 a.m. Rescue missions with emergency physicians on board increased over the years (2015 vs. 2019: 27 vs. 42%, p = 0.04). The primary weapons used were knives (56%), broken glass bottles (18%) and broken glasses (6%). Out of all patients 71 (27%, injury severity score 11 ± 14) were admitted to the major trauma center. Among these patients, the proportion of immediate surgical care (2015 vs. 2019: 20% vs. 35%, p < 0.05) and positive alcohol detection increased over the years (2015 vs. 2019: 10% vs. 43%, p < 0.05). The 30-day mortality in the 3 years studied was 1.1% (n = 3). Penetrating injuries associated with violence are relevant but rare rescue missions. Future care strategies should focus on deployment of rescue resources close to the scene of the incident (\"old town guard\", central station), and prevention strategies should focus on weapon prohibition zones. A control of alcohol consumption should be discussed. EINLEITUNG: Penetrierende Verletzungen sind eine seltene, aber immer wieder vorkommende Einsatzsituation in der Notfallmedizin. Das Ziel der Untersuchung war es, die Häufigkeit und Verletzungscharakteristika penetrierender, gewaltassoziierter Verletzungen einer Metropolregion über einen 5‑jährigen Zeitraum zu ermitteln. In der retrospektiven Untersuchung wurden anhand einer Datenbankabfrage der Leitstelle des Rettungsdienstbereichs Düsseldorf sämtliche rettungsdienstliche Einsätze mit penetrierenden, gewaltassoziierten Verletzungen in den Jahrgängen 2015, 2017 und 2019 identifiziert und deskriptiv analysiert. Für diejenigen Patienten, die dem überregionalen Traumazentrum (ÜTZ) zuverlegt wurden, erfolgte neben der präklinischen eine weitergehende transsektorale Analyse des innerklinischen Verlaufes. In den 3 Jahrgängen 2015, 2017 und 2019 konnten insgesamt 266 Patienten (Alter: 33 ± 14 Jahre, männlich: 79 %) mit penetrierenden, gewaltassoziierten Verletzungen erfasst werden (2015 vs. 2017 vs. 2019: n = 81 vs. n = 93 vs. n = 92). Die am häufigsten betroffene Altersgruppe war zwischen 15 und 34 Jahre alt. Eine höhere Einsatzhäufigkeit fand sich für die Stadtbezirke Altstadt, Stadtmitte und einen weiteren Stadtteil (Oberbilk). Eine hohe Einsatzhäufigkeit fand sich in den Nächten von Samstag auf Sonntag zwischen 20.00 und 04.00 Uhr. Rettungsdiensteinsätze mit Notarztbeteiligung nahmen über die Jahrgänge zu (2015 vs. 2019: 27 vs. 42 %, p = 0,04). Als Tatwaffe kamen vorwiegend Messer (56 %), abgeschlagene Glasflaschen (18 %) und Scherben (6 %) zum Einsatz. Im ÜTZ kamen 71 aller Patienten (27 %, Injury Severity Score 11 ± 14) zur Aufnahme. Bei diesen Patienten stiegen über die Jahre der Anteil einer unmittelbar erfolgten operativen Versorgung (2015 vs. 2019: 20 vs. 35 %, p < 0,05) und ein positiver Alkoholnachweis an (2015 vs. 2019: 10 vs. 43 %, p < 0,05). Die 30-Tages-Letalität betrug 1,1 % (n = 3). Penetrierende, gewaltassoziierte Verletzungen sind relevante, aber seltene rettungsdienstliche und innerklinische Einsatzsituationen. Zukünftige Versorgungsstrategien sollten sich auf die Stationierung von Rettungskräften in Schwerpunkteinsatzbereichen („Altstadtwache“, Hauptbahnhof) und Präventionsstrategien auf Waffen- und Glas‑/Flaschenzonen ausrichten. Eine Steuerung des Alkoholkonsums sollte diskutiert werden."

    "abstract": "Conducting urgent eye trauma surgery amidst the COVID-19 pandemic poses distinct difficulties, as strict infection control measures are crucial to safeguard both patients and medical staff. Nonetheless, eye trauma remains a significant contributor to avoidable vision loss in developing countries. A 57-year-old man presented with redness, bleeding, and injury in the left eye after a motorcycle accident 9 h prior to hospital admission, along with a torn wound on his left cheek. The visual acuity in the left eye showed no light perception. Limited eye movement in all directions, eyelid hematoma, conjunctival injection, hyphema, and tissue protrusion from the limbus at 6 to 8 o'clock positions were observed. The patient had a history of cataract surgery (+) in both eyes and was diagnosed with an open globe injury with zone II penetrating trauma, accompanied by full hyphema, vitreous and choroid prolapse in the left eye, and a confirmed case of COVID-19. Evisceration of the left eye was performed following the basic guidelines for ocular trauma surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Postoperative follow-up was conducted as usual by the operator in isolation for confirmed COVID-19 patients with no significant complaints. Urgent surgical intervention is necessary to prevent visual impairment, following guidelines recommending surgery within 4-72 h. Ocular tissue may facilitate COVID-19 transmission via the nasolacrimal system, posing risks to healthcare workers, particularly during surgery. Preoperative measures, including obtaining COVID-19 status and providing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), are crucial. Minimizing aerosol-generating procedures and employing virucidal disinfection further mitigates the transmission risks. This case underscores the need to balance immediate intervention for eye injuries with safety protocols for COVID-19, emphasizing standardized PPE and surgical procedures to safeguard healthcare professionals. Incorporating insights gained during the COVID-19 pandemic will fortify healthcare systems against future pandemics. In particular, it enables effective surgical emergency response while mitigating infectious disease risks."

    "abstract": "IntroductionThis study aims to evaluate clinical outcomes among severely injured trauma patients presenting with isolated blunt abdominal solid organ injuries with a pre-diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (LC) undergoing emergency laparotomy vs nonoperative management (NOM).MethodsThis retrospective cohort study utilized the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Program Participant Use File (ACS-TQIP-PUF) dataset from 2017 to 2021. Adults (≥18 years) with a pre-existing diagnosis of LC who presented with severe blunt (ISS ≥ 16) isolated solid organ abdominal injuries and underwent laparotomy or NOM were included. Outcomes of interest included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU-LOS), and in-hospital complications such as acute renal failure and deep vein thrombosis.Results929 patients were included in this analysis, with 355 undergoing laparotomy and 574 managed nonoperatively. Laparotomy patients suffered greater in-hospital mortality (n = 186, 52.3% vs n = 115, 20.0%; P < .01), required significantly more blood within 4 hours (8.9 units vs 4.3 units, P < .01), and had a significantly longer ICU-LOS (10.2 days vs 6.7 days, P < .01). In the 1:1 propensity score matched analysis of 556 matched patients, in-hospital mortality was greater for laparotomy patients (52.3% vs 20.0%, P < .01).ConclusionLaparotomy was associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality in propensity-matched trauma patients, longer ICU-LOS, and more blood products given at 4 hours compared to NOM. These findings illustrate that NOM may be a safe approach in managing severely injured trauma patients with isolated blunt abdominal solid organ injuries and a pre-diagnosis of LC."

We discuss our case as well as provide a thorough literature review made on databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase. A fifteen-year-old female presented after a motor vehicle collision with abdominal pain and imaging suggestive of pancreatic and duodenal injuries. Emergent exploratory laparotomy confirmed a transection of the pancreatic neck in addition to disruption of the second portion of the duodenum. She sustained other injuries including an injury to the portal vein and a right colonic perforation. A damage control strategy was employed, and the patient underwent duodenal repair, wide drainage of the pancreatic injury, primary portal vein repair, right hemicolectomy, and temporary abdominal closure using negative pressure wound dressing placement. She remained stable overnight in the ICU and was taken back to the operating room for a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with a hepatobiliary surgeon the following afternoon. The patient required additional surgery for fixation of an unstable vertebral fracture but was discharged to inpatient rehab within two weeks of presentation. She did not require TPN, and the only long-term sequelae have been admissions for acute uncomplicated pancreatitis that have been treated medically. Combined pancreatic and duodenal injury in the pediatric population is uncommon. We discuss our case of a patient requiring a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Despite postoperative pancreatitis and limited information in this field, we believe we provided the optimal surgical care, and this is a potential area for future investigation."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade as the presenting manifestation of systemic lymphoma is relatively uncommon. Pericardium is the commonest site of involvement in secondary malignancies with systemic lymphoma involving the heart in 20% of the cases. We describe a case of a 78-year-old gentleman, who presented with symptoms of new onset cardiac failure, and hemodynamic compromise. An echocardiography revealed cardiac tamponade, necessitating an emergency pericardiocentesis. With the aid of multimodality imaging, he was found to have a right atrioventricular groove mass, widespread lymph node enlargement with bone and peritoneal involvement. Ultimately, a histopathological evaluation revealed a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Our case illustrates that a patient with DLBCL may present with cardiac tamponade as a result of metastasis. This diagnosis, although rare, is likely to be missed, which can cause fatal complications, such as cardiac tamponade, fatal arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors in the digestive tract and arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal in the mesenteric plexus. These tumors can originate in any part of the GI tract; however, a higher burden has been observed in the stomach and small intestines. Mesenteric GISTs are exceedingly rare, with unique clinicopathological features and a poorer prognosis. Herein, we describe a unique case of a 66-year-old female with a remote history of appendectomy who presented to the emergency room complaining of severe abdominal pain and vomiting. On imaging, the patient was found to have a large inflammatory mass associated with small bowel loops, and the pathology confirmed a mesenteric GIST. The tumor was resected, and the genomic test results confirmed the KIT (exon 11) mutation. Although the tumor had a low mitotic rate, the tumor was large enough to warrant the initiation of adjuvant imatinib mesylate for 36 months with regular bloodwork and imaging."

    "abstract": "Penetrating neck trauma is becoming a more frequently encountered presentation in UK emergency departments. Although largely attributable to violent crime, other aetiologies are on the rise. This study aimed to review changes in the pattern of penetrating neck injury (PNI) over a five-year period at our level 1 major trauma centre. Data were retrospectively collected on all patients presenting to the emergency department with PNIs between 2016 and 2021. The number of these injuries doubled between 2016 and 2021, accounting for 11% of all penetrating trauma in 2021. The majority of patients were male (87%). Violence remained the predominant aetiology but numbers of self-harm-related PNIs trebled between 2018 and 2021. PNIs are on the rise. These injuries remain complex to manage and require a multidisciplinary approach. Tackling violent crime remains essential in combating PNIs, but focus must also be placed on identifying and supporting individuals most at risk of deliberate self-harm from a deterioration in mental health."

Herewith, we present a case of a 31-year-old female patient who experienced a spontaneous splenic rupture following a singleton vaginal delivery. Despite lacking any history of trauma or a predisposing factor, she developed symptoms of dizziness and postpartum abdominal pain, progressing rapidly to unconsciousness. Urgent abdominal ultrasound revealed significant intraperitoneal bleeding with a large peri-splenic hematoma, necessitating emergency exploratory laparotomy. Histopathological examination of a frozen section ruled out malignancy, and thus, a complete splenectomy was done, which confirmed the diagnosis of spontaneous splenic rupture. This case emphasizes the importance of close monitoring of all postpartum women, even those with low-risk pregnancies, for the early detection of any complication. Healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for rare but potentially life-threatening events to ensure timely intervention and optimal outcomes."

Acute pericarditis accounts for approximately 0.1% of inpatient admissions and 5% of non-ischemic chest pain visits to the emergency departments (EDs). Most patients who present with acute pericarditis have a benign course and good prognosis. However, a rare percent of the patients develop complicated pericarditis. Examples of complications include pericardiac effusion, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, effusive and constrictive pericarditis and, even more rarely, large pleural effusion The occurrence of complicated pericarditis can lead to high morbidity and mortality if not urgently managed in most patients. Our case presents a 60-year-old male that presented to the emergency room with flu-like symptoms. However, the viral panel test was negative. He initially got discharged with supportive care but was brought back to the ED by his wife in a critical, life-threatening state due to pericarditis symptoms complicated by tamponade and shock. His condition required urgent intervention and critical level of care. The patient's course was also complicated by myopericarditis and recurrent bilateral pleural effusions, which required therapeutic interventions. This unique case presents the patient group that develop multiple life-threatening complications of acute pericarditis, including cardiac tamponade and shock, affecting several end organs. This case also highlights clues to the predisposing factors to complications of acute pericarditis. Patients who present with high-risk signs and symptoms indicating poorer prognosis warrant further observation and admission. This will also add to the literature reviews regarding the risk factors associated with development of complicated acute pericarditis. This will also serve as a review of pathophysiology, etiology, current diagnosis and available novel treatment for such patients."

Target undertriage and overtriage rates of <5% and <35% are difficult for centers to achieve, and performance variability exists. The objective of this study was to optimize and externally validate a previously developed hospital trauma triage prediction model to predict the need for emergent intervention in 6 hours (NEI-6), an indicator of need for a full TTA. The model was previously developed and internally validated using data from 31 US trauma centers. Data were collected prospectively at five sites using a mobile application which hosted the NEI-6 model. A weighted multiple logistic regression model was used to retrain and optimize the model using the original data set and a portion of data from one of the prospective sites. The remaining data from the five sites were designated for external validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) were used to assess the validation cohort. Subanalyses were performed for age, race, and mechanism of injury. 14 421 patients were included in the training data set and 2476 patients in the external validation data set across five sites. On validation, the model had an overall undertriage rate of 9.1% and overtriage rate of 53.7%, with an AUROC of 0.80 and an AUPRC of 0.63. Blunt injury had an undertriage rate of 8.8%, whereas penetrating injury had 31.2%. For those aged ≥65, the undertriage rate was 8.4%, and for Black or African American patients the undertriage rate was 7.7%. The optimized and externally validated NEI-6 model approaches the recommended undertriage and overtriage rates while significantly reducing variability of TTA across centers for blunt trauma patients. The model performs well for populations that traditionally have high rates of undertriage. 2."

It is preferred by women or couples who have achieved their reproductive potential and do not desire pregnancy. BTL carries a low risk of method failure with a subsequent pregnancy which is likely to be ectopic. We present a case of two consecutive ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancies following an interval BTL. A 40-year-old female, with 7 living children, who previously underwent an interval BTL, presented with acute abdominal pain for 2 days and amenorrhea for 6 weeks. She was stable but had generalized abdominal tenderness, guarding and rebound tenderness, and cervical motion tenderness. Her urine HCG was positive, and a trans-abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a tender echo-complex right adnexal mass, free fluid in the Cul-de-sac, and an empty uterine cavity, consistent with a ruptured right ectopic pregnancy. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was done with findings of a ruptured right distal tube containing products of conception, hemoperitoneum, and previous tubal ligation and left salpingectomy. A right total salpingectomy was done, and the excised right tube containing the mass was sent for histological examination, which revealed chorionic villi and hemorrhagic vascular decidual tissue in the fallopian tube, features suggestive of tubal ectopic pregnancy."

The case involved a patient with a pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the left lung, treated in our department. Following 1 month of albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy and localized radiotherapy for the left lung lesion, the patient initiated treatment with a single agent, Endostar 30mg, on October 19, 2021.

By October 28, the patient presented with pronounced dyspnea and respiratory distress. An emergency CT scan detected pericardial tamponade and significant deviations in several blood parameters from pretreatment values. Percardial puncture and catheter drainage were recommended as therapeutic intervention. Considering the patient advanced age, the patient and their family opted to refuse this medical procedure, leading to the patient unfortunate demise on November 2, 2021.

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of a traumatic unstable pelvis in a stable patient is a temporary concept depending on when we see the patient, as all patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock have hemodynamic stability until they become unstable. As a rule, the more unstable the pelvic fracture is, the higher the risk of bleeding and hemodynamic instability it has. Therefore, in unstable pelvic fractures, hemodynamic stability should be a diagnosis by exclusion. For bleeding detection in stable patients, an immediate one-stage contrast-enhanced CT scan is the appropriate diagnosis test; however, since CT scan radiation is always an issue, X-rays should be considered in those cases of hemodynamically stable patients in whom there is a reasonable suspicion that no unsafe bleeding is going on. Pelvic fracture classification is essential as usually there is an association between the injury mechanism, the fracture displacement, and the hemodynamic stability. Anteroposterior and, particularly, vertical traumatisms have much more proclivity to provoke major pelvic displacement and bleeding. The use of a pelvic binder, as early as possible including pre-hospital management, should be standard in high-impact blunt trauma patients independently of the trauma mechanisms. External fixation is the preferred method of stabilization in case of open fractures, and, in closed ones, when the schedule for definite osteosynthesis prolongs because of the patient's general condition. If possible, immediate percutaneous sacroiliac screw insertion for unstable pelvic fractures produce excellent results even in open fractures."

Meckel's diverticulum, a rare disease, may result in acute intestinal obstruction and is frequently misdiagnosed. This study aims to report a case of acute intestinal obstruction due to Meckel's diverticulum. A 61-year-old Javanese man was admitted to the emergency room with a history of constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Physical examination showed abdomen distention, tenderness in the lower quadrant, and hyperactive bowel sound. Rectal examination found that the rectal ampulla was collapsed. A plain abdominal Radiograph showed small bowel dilatation and air-fluid levels. The patient was diagnosed with small bowel obstruction due to suspected left-sided colon cancer and taken up for exploratory laparotomy. On exploration, Meckel's diverticulum measuring 3.5 cm in length and with a 2 cm base was found about 70 cm proximal to the Bauhin valve; the thin part formed a band that entangled the small bowel. Ileo-ileal resection anastomosis was performed. Meckel's diverticulum is an intestinal pouch caused by incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct during gestation. This condition affects 2 % of the population and is within 2 feet of the Bauhin valve. The mesodiverticular band was found to be the source of the bowel obstruction. Surgical resection is required for complicated diverticulum. Meckel's diverticulum can be difficult to diagnose and require a higher level of suspicion. Although Meckel's diverticulum is uncommon in adults, it should be considered a cause of small bowel obstruction."

As an often-catastrophic event, death typically ensues within minutes due to sudden massive hemopericardium resulting in cardiac tamponade. Early recognition is pivotal, and may allow for pericardial drainage and open surgical repair as the only emergent life-saving procedure. In cases of contained rupture with pseudo-aneurysm (PSA) formation, hospitalization with subsequent early surgical intervention is warranted. Not uncommonly, PSA may go unrecognized in asymptomatic patients and diagnosed late during subsequent cardiac imaging. In these patients, the unsettling risk of complete rupture demands early surgical repair. Novel developments, in the field of transcatheter-based therapies and multimodality imaging, have enabled percutaneous PSA repair as a feasible alternate strategy for patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk. Contemporary advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of postmyocardial infarction ventricular free-wall rupture and PSA are provided in this review."

    "abstract": "An 8-month-old castrated male British Shorthair cat presented with acute anorexia and vomiting. The overall clinical presentation included generalized depression. Physical examination revealed palpable abdominal mass, thus foreign body or intussusception was suspected. Abdominal radiographs showed segmental dilation of small intestine and ultrasonography revealed target lesion with dilated small bowel loops and disrupted normal wall layering, suggestive of intussusception. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed congenital mesenteric defects associated with small intestinal obstruction. Surgical intervention involved dissection, ligation of encircling blood vessels, and closure of mesenteric defects. The cat was discharged after 3 days, exhibiting normal postoperative recovery. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of congenital mesenteric defect associated with small intestinal obstruction in a cat. While internal hernias are rare, it is essential to include them in the differential diagnosis for cases of intestinal obstruction, particularly in patients with no history of previous surgery or trauma. The potential for strangulation and ischemia in the affected loops elevates internal hernias to a critical, life-threatening condition, emphasizing the need for prompt recognition and urgent surgical intervention as an emergency."

He sustained second- and third-degree burns to the extremities, right carotid artery dissection, and multiple fractures to the mandible, pelvis and forearm. Free fluid was also noted in the pelvis prompting an emergent exploratory laparotomy. In the operating room, he was found to have a cecal serosal injury involving more than 50% of the circumference and a sigmoid and descending colon degloving injury of 50 cm. The injured segments were resected, and primary anastomoses were created. Degloving of the colon is extremely rare and the sigmoid is one of the more frequently documented locations of injury.

They are pulsion diverticula that are often asymptomatic and can be found incidentally during surgery. In some instances, jejunal diverticula could result in intestinal obstruction. Small intestinal volvulus is an uncommon cause of small bowel obstruction that results in a closed loop obstruction and is an indication for emergent surgical intervention. CASE REPORT We report a case of an 84-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain and generalized weakness. A preoperative computerized tomographic scan demonstrated a closed loop small bowel obstruction with mesenteric swirling. The patient was taken for a diagnostic laparoscopy, which revealed extensive proximal jejunal diverticulosis and a volvulus of the involved jejunum. An exploratory laparotomy was warranted for safe detorsion of the small bowel and resection of the diseased segment. The small bowel was successfully detorsed, with resection of the involved jejunum. Intestinal continuity was established by a primary side-to-side anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS Jejunal diverticula have been reported in the literature as a cause of small bowel obstructions, and very few reports exist of concurrent small bowel volvulus. In very rare instances, both of these conditions can coexist. There should be prompt surgical intervention in all cases of closed loop small bowel obstructions to prevent intestinal ischemia, perforation, and sepsis."

This study evaluates the outcomes of surgical rescue performed within 24 h of undergoing PTMC from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2019. Out of 2259 PTMC patients, 22 patients (< 1%) required rescue mitral valve surgery. Out of 22 patients, 17 patients (77.27%) developed mitral regurgitation; five patients (22.7%) had cardiac tamponade. Mitral valve replacement was performed in 20 patients (90.9%), while two patients (9.1%) underwent mitral valve repair. Cardiac tamponade was secondary to injury of the left atrium (9.1%), left ventricle (4.5%), and right ventricle (9.1%). Concomitant tricuspid valve repair was done in three patients (13.6%). Intraoperatively, anterior mitral leaflet tear was seen in 68.2% while posterior mitral leaflet tear was noted in 9.1%. Postoperatively, three patients (13.6%) required prolonged ventilation, incidence of stroke was 4.5% (n = 1), and in-hospital mortality was 4.5% (n = 1).

In resource-poor settings, a high index of suspicion and serum β-hCG are crucial for diagnosis. Intracerebral hemorrhage in the young is rarely caused by metastatic choriocarcinoma. Diagnosis of this condition may be particularly challenging in resource-poor settings where access to diagnostic technologies may be limited. We present a case series of three young females diagnosed with metastatic choriocarcinoma after initially presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage, each demonstrating unique clinical manifestations. We aim to highlight the diagnostic considerations in the management of this infrequently encountered cause of intracerebral hemorrhage, especially in resource-constrained settings. Case 1 involved a 21-year-old woman who was initially diagnosed with intracerebral hemorrhage likely of tumoral origin from an unknown primary source. Further evaluation revealed extremely high levels of β-hCG and features suggestive of an intrauterine malignancy, which led to a diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. This further became complicated by pulmonary embolism. Unfortunately, she succumbed to respiratory failure during treatment. Case 2 is a young woman who presented to the emergency unit and was managed as a case of lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Further checks revealed a previous history of hysterectomy done on account of placental site trophoblastic tumor, which promoted an evaluation for choriocarcinoma. Case 3 involved a 20-year-old patient who initially presented with headache and vomiting. An enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed a large subacute right temporal occipital subependymal hemorrhage with mass effect. After probing further, we discovered that she underwent exploratory laparotomy for suspected ruptured ectopic gestation, which later turned out to be a gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. After further evaluation a diagnosis of choriocarcinoma with brain metastasis. Our case series emphasizes the importance of having a high index suspicion in young females who present with atypical features of ICH. The varied clinical scenarios highlight the challenges in diagnosing young females. It also underscores the critical role of serum β-hCG, especially in resource-limited settings where biopsies are not readily available. Building a repository of these diverse manifestations is essential for increasing the index of suspicion and ultimately improving patient outcomes."

Management of 4,077 patients was observed; 1,126 (28 %) during on-hours and 2,951(72 %) during off-hours. At baseline, four of 20 KPIs were performed significantly more often during off-hours. TIF improved care during both on- and off-hours. Seventeen KPIs improved during on-hours and 18 KPIs improved during off-hours. After TIF, six KPIs were performed more often during on-hours, but differences, though significant, were small (1-5 %). Examples of KPIs which were performed more often during on-hours after TIF included: airway assessment (99 % for on-hours vs. 98 % for off-hours), evaluation for intra-abdominal bleeding (91 % vs. 87 %), and spine immobilization for blunt trauma (90 % vs. 85 %) (all p < 0.05). At baseline, mortality among seriously injured patients (Injury Severity Score >9) was higher during on-hours (27 %) compared to off-hours (17 %, p = 0.047). TIF lowered mortality for seriously injured patients during both on-hours (27 % before TIF, 8 % after, p = 0.027) and during off-hours (17 % before, 7 % after, p = 0.004). After TIF, mortality among seriously injured patients was equal between on- and off-hours (8 % vs. 7 %, NS). At baseline, KPIs of trauma care were slightly better during off-hours compared with on-hours, and mortality was lower among seriously injured patient during off-hours. A quality improvement initiative (the TIF) using built-in decision support prompts improved care strongly in both on- and off-hours and eliminated the mortality difference between on- and off-hours. Use of similar decision support prompts during initial trauma care should be promoted widely in other low- and middle-income countries."

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of early death after injury. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) represents a paradigm shift in achieving hemodynamic stability and its implementation still remain controversial in different settings. The recently published UK-REBOA Randomized Clinical Trial aimed to determine the effectiveness of REBOA in patients with hemorrhagic shock, concluding its increased mortality compared with standard care alone. An adjustment of the statistical analysis was performed and a comprehensive analysis was proposed to address the study's limitations and demonstrate that these conclusions cannot be considered as benchmarks. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed using Bayesian logistic regression and generalized linear models suitable for the outcome distribution. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups for the primary outcome (p-value 0.3341) nor in most of the secondary outcomes. The results of the principal stratum analyses (to account for intercurrent events) also did not show significant differences after the statistical analysis tests. It cannot be stated that REBOA increases mortality compared with standard care alone in trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage. Further studies and adequate simulation training programs in REBOA are critical to its successful implementation within a trauma system and to identify the optimum settings and patients."

    "abstract": "Visceral artery aneurysm is a rare and potentially fatal vascular condition that typically affects the superior mesenteric or inferior mesenteric arteries, the splenic, hepatic, and celiac arteries, as well as their branches. Visceral artery aneurysms can usually be treated using endovascular intervention, open surgery, or percutaneous thrombin injection. A 9-year-old girl was admitted to our trauma center with abdominal and bilateral leg pain after a car accident involving a head-on collision. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed bowel herniation through a muscle defect in the left lateral abdominal wall. There was a small amount of fluid around the liver and spleen, mild thickening of the small bowel wall, and infiltration in the small bowel mesentery, indicating the possibility of small bowel injury. Emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed. After resection of the ischemic parts of the terminal ileum and sigmoid colon, intestinal continuity was reestablished. Primary repair was performed on a traumatic left lateral abdominal wall hernia. She recovered well postoperatively without any complications. A follow-up abdominal CT scan after 2 months showed a pseudoaneurysm of the ileal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Despite the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms, the pseudoaneurysm was treated by endovascular intervention using numerous coils because of the significant risk of delayed rupture or massive bleeding. Follow-up abdominal CT scan after 6 months showed complete occlusion and resorption of the pseudoaneurysm. Although it is technically challenging, endovascular coil embolization may be a feasible technique in children with traumatic visceral artery pseudoaneurysms without complications."

    "abstract": "Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is considered the gold standard for monitoring allograft rejection after heart transplantation. EMB is an invasive procedure that may be performed via a trans-jugular or a trans-femoral approach with a complication rate reported as less than 6%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the complication rate after EMBs in heart recipients and to compare the results of EMBs performed via a trans-jugular or a trans-femoral approach. Medical records of heart recipients undergoing EMBs between January 2012 and December 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. EMB-related complications were classified as major (death, pericardial effusion, hemopericardium, cardiac tamponade requiring a pericardiocentesis or an urgent cardiac surgery, ventricular arrythmias, permanent atrio-ventricular block requiring permanent pacing, hemothorax, pneumothorax and retroperitoneal bleeding) and minor (de novo tricuspid regurgitation, arrhythmias, coronary artery fistula, vascular access site complications). A total of 1698 EMBs were performed during the study period at our institution in 212 heart recipients. There were 927 (55%) EMBs performed through a trans-jugular approach (TJ group) and 771 (45%) EMBs performed through a trans-femoral approach (TF group). A total of 60 (3.5%) complications were recorded, including nine (0.5%) major complications (six cardiac tamponades, two pneumothorax and one retroperitoneal bleeding) and 51 (3%) minor complications (seven coronary fistulae, five de novo tricuspid regurgitation, four supraventricular arrythmias and thirty-five vascular access site complications). No difference was found in total (38 [4%] vs. 22 [3%]; p = 0.16) and major (6 [1%} vs. 3 [0.4%]; p = 0.65) complications (32 [3%] vs. 19 [2%]; p = 0.23) between the TJ group and the TF group. No difference was found in male sex, age at time of EMB and time from HT between complicated and not complicated EMBs. EMBs represent a safe procedure with a low risk of complications. In our experience, EMBs performed via a trans-jugular approach are as safe as the trans-femoral approach."

While ocular fishing injuries are infrequent, they carry the potential for severe ocular trauma, and safe extraction of a fish hook can pose challenges. We here in report a series of 21 cases of penetrating injury to the cornea by fish hook, detailing successful surgical interventions employed for their management. The report not only outlines different techniques for the removal of fish hooks but also provides clarification on terminologies associated with various components of a fish hook. This was a retrospective study conducted at tertiary eye care centers in South India. Our hospitals cater to the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. All medical records of patients who attended the emergency department from the period of 2003 to 2023 were evaluated and all patients with fish hook injury were included in the study. This is the longest and largest study in India. Twenty-one cases of ocular fish-hook injuries were presented to the emergency room between 2003 and 2023. Patients were between the ages of 9 and 59 years (mean, 29.4 years), and 90.4 % (19 out of 21) were males. Patient demographics, injury characteristics, surgical interventions, and visual outcomes were meticulously documented. Out of 21 cases, three cases (14.3 %) had blunt trauma, 17 cases (80.9 %) had penetrating injury and one case had lid laceration. Patients had better visual outcomes after the second surgery. Out of 21 cases, 7 (33.3 %) had post-operative visual acuity (VA) between 20/20 and 20/40. Three (14.3 %) had post-operative VA between 20/60 and 20/125. Five (23.8 %) had post-operative VA between 20/200 and 20/600. Six cases (28.6 %) had poor visual outcomes of which two had no perception of light (NPL), two had Hand movements and the other two had the perception of light present and projection of rays inaccurate CONCLUSION: This extensive case series underscores the complexity of ocular injuries caused by fish hooks and emphasizes significance of tailored surgical approaches for optimal visual outcomes. The hook can be successfully removed with minimal trauma to ocular structures by understanding structure of fish hook and by employing appropriate method of extraction."

Systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and two research registers were searched until September 2023. All comparative studies (prospective or retrospective) that examined the potential benefits and/or harms of immobilisation practices during pre-hospital and emergency care of patients with a potential cervical spine injury (pre-imaging) following blunt trauma. Two authors independently selected and extracted data. Risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies. Data were synthesised without meta-analysis. Six observational studies met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality was variable, with most studies having serious or critical risk of bias. The effect of cervical spine immobilisation practices such as full immobilisation or movement minimisation during pre-hospital and emergency care did not show clear evidence of benefit for the prevention of neurological deterioration, spinal injuries and death compared with no immobilisation. However, increased pain, discomfort and anatomical complications were associated with collar application during immobilisation. Despite the limited evidence, weak designs and limited generalisability, the available data suggest that pre-hospital cervical spine immobilisation (full immobilisation or movement minimisation) was of uncertain value due to the lack of demonstrable benefit and may lead to potential complications and adverse outcomes.

    "abstract": "This case report presents the rare occurrence of hematochezia due to an internal iliac artery aneurysm leading to an arterioenteric fistula, expanding the differential diagnosis for gastrointestinal bleeding. It emphasizes the importance of considering vascular origins in cases of atypical hematochezia, particularly in the absence of common gastrointestinal causes, and highlights the role of imaging and multidisciplinary management in diagnosing and treating such unusual presentations. A 75-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with 12 d of hematochezia, experiencing bloody stools 7-8 times per day. Initial computed tomography (CT) scans revealed an aneurysmal rupture near the right internal iliac artery with suspected hematoma development. Hemoglobin levels progressively decreased to 7 g/dL. Emergency arterial angiography and iliac artery-covered stent placement were performed, followed by balloon angioplasty. Despite initial stabilization, minor rectal bleeding and abdominal pain persisted, leading to further diagnostic colonoscopy. This identified a neoplasm and potential perforation at the proximal rectum. An exploratory laparotomy confirmed the presence of a hematoma and an aneurysm invading the rectal wall, necessitating partial rectal resection, intestinal anastomosis, and ileostomy. Postoperative recovery was successful, with no further bleeding incidents and normal follow-up CT and colonoscopy results after six months. In cases of unusual gastrointestinal bleeding, it is necessary to consider vascular causes for effective diagnosis and intervention."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced pericarditis and pericardial myocarditis are common entities; however, the development of pericardial effusion post-COVID-19 infection has only been reported in about 5% of cases. Rapid and acute progression to pericardial tamponade is uncommon, and progression to effusive constrictive pericarditis (ECP) and pericardial decompression syndrome (PDS) is an even rarer phenomenon. We describe these phenomena in this report to raise awareness and aid clinicians in the early diagnosis and management of these conditions. We report a case of a 45-year-old female with a past medical history of recent COVID-19 infection, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and hypertension who presented with severe chest pain, which was determined to be acute pericarditis post-COVID-19 infection. The patient developed a large pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade within one day of initial presentation. Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed but was complicated by rapid decompensation of the patient, which has been assumed to be ECP following pericardiocentesis and PDS.  Close monitoring of acute pericarditis with pericardial effusion is required in these patients for the early detection of cardiac tamponade, which requires urgent pericardiocentesis. Judicious post-pericardiocentesis follow-up is also required for the early diagnosis of conditions such as ECP and PDS. These cases are generally managed symptomatically, but in cases of severe ECP syndrome, pericardial stripping may be required."

Clinical presentation typically involves pain and protrusion of intestinal contents or even abdominal viscera. Diagnosis relies on thorough clinical assessment, and treatment strategies should be tailored to each patient.

    "abstract": "Clinical examination alone cannot reliably rule out significant traumatic abdominal injury. Computed tomography (CT) has become the primary method for evaluating blunt abdominal trauma and clinicians rely heavily on it to rule out abdominal injury. Ultrasound examination may miss significant abdominal injury particularly in stable patients. The use of a contrast agent improves ultrasound sensitivity to visceral abdominal injuries. The objective of this diagnostic study is to compare bedside contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) performed by emergency physicians to CT in hemodynamically stable adults for the assessment of blunt abdominal trauma and evaluate CEUS accuracy outcomes. Hemodynamically stable patients with blunt trauma were prospectively enrolled in the trauma bay. After initial evaluation, we included patients at risk of abdominal injury and for whom an abdominal CT was planned by the trauma leader. Ultrasonography was performed prospectively and at the bedside by the emergency physician followed by abdominal CT used as a reference standard. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study; among them, 52% showed positive traumatic findings in abdominal CT scans, and 42% were diagnosed with solid organ lesions. Compared to CT, a focused abdominal sonography (FOCUS) examination, looking for free fluid or perirenal hematoma, showed limited performance for traumatic findings with a sensitivity of 65% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38%-86%), a specificity of 75% (95% CI: 48%-93%), a negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.23-0.95), and a positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 2.59 (95% CI: 1.03-6.48). When combining FOCUS with CEUS, the sensitivity of the sonography increased to 94% (95% CI: 71%-100%) with a specificity of 75% (95% CI: 48%-93%). The PLR was 3.76 (95% CI: 1.6-8.87) and the NLR was 0.08 (95% CI: 0.01-0.54). In our population, abdominal sonography with contrast failed to identify a single positive abdominal CT with a grade 1 kidney injury. A FOCUS examination shows limited sensitivity and specificity to detect positive abdominal CT in stable adults with abdominal trauma. With the addition of contrast and careful inspection of solid organs, abdominal sonography with contrast performed by the emergency physician improves the ability to rule out traumatic findings on abdominal CT. CEUS performed by emergency physicians may miss injuries, especially in the absence of free fluid, in cases of low-grade injuries, simultaneous injuries, or poor-quality examinations."

Interestingly, the optimal timing, indications, and surgical techniques have not been standardized. We retrospectively analyzed 35 patients who underwent surgical treatment for chest trauma. All patients with penetrating trauma (n=4) underwent emergency surgery for a hemothorax. There were no postoperative complications or hospital deaths. All patients with blunt trauma( n= 31) had multiple rib fractures;rib fixation was performed in 29 patients( 94%). Eight patients( 26%) had flail chest. The duration from injury to surgery averaged 7.5 days. The prognosis was generally favorable with no postoperative complications, but two patients died in the hospital due to multiple organ failure caused by high-energy trauma. Patients with flail chest or multiple organ injury had prolonged postoperative hospital stays. Patients who sustain chest trauma follow various clinical courses. Appropriate timing of surgical intervention at an early stage after injury can be life saving and hasten a functional recovery."

    "abstract": "Objective: Many current trauma mortality prediction tools are either too intricate or rely on data not readily available during a trauma patient's initial evaluation. Moreover, none are tailored to those necessitating urgent or emergent surgery. Our objective was to design a practical, user-friendly scoring tool using immediately available variables, and then compare its efficacy to the widely-known Revised Trauma Score (RTS). Methods: The adult 2017-2021 Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database was queried to identify patients ≥18 years old undergoing any urgent/emergent operation (direct from Emergency Department to operating room). Patients were divided into derivation and validation groups. A three-step methodology was used. First, multiple logistic regression models were created to determine risk of death using only variables available upon arrival. Second, the weighted average and relative impact of each independent predictor was used to derive an easily calculated Immediate Operative Trauma Assessment Score (IOTAS). We then validated IOTAS using AUROC and compared it to RTS. Results: From 249 208 patients in the derivation-set, 14 635 (5.9%) died. Age ≥65, Glasgow Coma Scale score <9, hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg), and tachycardia (>120/min) on arrival were identified as independent predictors for mortality. Using these, the IOTAS was structured, offering scores between 0-8. The AUROC for this was .88. A clear escalation in mortality was observed across scores: from 4.4% at score 1 to 60.5% at score 8. For the validation set (250 182 patients; mortality rate 5.8%), the AUROC remained consistent at .87, surpassing RTS's AUROC of .83. Conclusion: IOTAS is a novel, accurate, and now validated tool that is intuitive and efficient in predicting mortality for trauma patients requiring urgent or emergent surgeries. It outperforms RTS, and thereby may help guide clinicians when determining the best course of action in patient management as well as counseling patients and their families."

    "abstract": "Sudden death from haemopericardium as a result of a right atrial rupture is uncommon, most particularly when this occurs spontaneously without any prior trauma or evidence of atrial wall pathology. The deceased was a 32-year-old man. At lunchtime his symptoms of unease, giddiness and unconsciousness began and within 45 minutes he arrived at the hospital. His vitals could not be recorded in the emergency department, and after CPR, he was pronounced dead. At autopsy, an isolated right atrial rupture, without any disease of the heart wall, was discovered. The right atrium has the weakest wall and is frequently the site of spontaneous rupture brought on by increased intraluminal pressure. Both liquid blood and clotted blood were found in the pericardial cavity. Low atrial pressure encourages clot formation because it causes considerably slower blood entry into the pericardium at the time of atrial rupture compared with entry at the time of ventricular rupture. Evidence of chronic lung disease was found which explains the raised intraluminal pressure of the heart chambers. Even with no history of trauma or myocardial infarction, the Beck triad - an engorged neck vein, a muffled heart sound, and low blood pressure - should alert the emergency room staff to the possibility of cardiac tamponade because, in a very unlikely scenario, spontaneous cardial wall rupture might occur."

This presentation follows the wound healing for 28 days following the operation and demonstrates the efficacy of fish skin xenografts in improved wound healing. A 61-year-old female with a past medical history of colon cancer and recent chemotherapy treatment presented with colon perforation causing right flank cellulitis and sepsis with necrotic abdominal wall tissue extending into the hip joint. She was taken for an emergent exploratory laparotomy, drainage of abdominal and retroperitoneal abscesses, open right hemicolectomy, diverting ileostomy, abdominal washout, intra-abdominal omental patch, placement of Strattice mesh, and debridement of necrotizing soft tissue infection of the right flank. After extensive debridement of her 15x10cmx5cm deep wound and placement of a Kerecis™ fish skin xenograft, the wound had completely healed with excellent granulation tissue, and the patient was scheduled for placement of a skin graft 28 days following the initial procedure. The results after xenograft application were outstanding, supporting the use of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) based xenografts in wound treatment due to their anti-inflammatory and angiogenic properties. This is definitely an option that needs to be considered in expediting the healing process for complex wounds."

    "abstract": "Perforated bowel and adhesive intestinal obstruction are common indications for emergency surgical intervention in a preterm neonate. The initial approach to managing perforation involves either peritoneal drain insertion or formal laparotomy. Once a neonate presents with complete bowel obstruction, prompt abdominal exploration becomes crucial. One prevalent cause of bowel obstruction in this population is adhesions resulting from previous surgeries. This report details the case of a preterm, extremely low birth weight neonate experiencing pneumoperitoneum, initially managed with an intraperitoneal drain. Despite temporary improvement, the infant developed recurrent pneumoperitoneum, necessitating formal exploratory laparotomy. Approximately one month post-surgery, the baby encountered complete bowel obstruction due to adhesive intestinal obstruction, requiring a second exploratory laparotomy. The child survived both surgical interventions and is thriving at follow-up. Our findings suggest that in select cases, intraperitoneal drain placement may suffice. However, there is a need for further research to improve the suspicion and diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum perforations in neonates. Additionally, vigilant assessment and timely intervention for adhesive intestinal obstruction can enhance bowel salvage outcomes."

After adequate resuscitation with IV fluids and preoperative preparation, the patient was transported to the operating room for an emergency exploratory laparotomy. Multiple jejunal diverticuli were identified in the proximal jejunum at the antimesenteric border, less than three feet from the duodenojejunal (DJ) junction. The terminal ileum was found to be 360° rotated counterclockwise around the small bowel mesentery, causing the small intestine to appear congested; however, after clockwise de-rotation, the small bowel regained its normal color. Adhesiolysis and small bowel decompression were performed, and the patient had an uneventful recovery."

While ultrasound is often the first radiological modality used, Computed Tomography (CT) shows a clear picture and aides to reach a diagnosis. In circumstances where appropriate imaging modalities are not available, or the operator is inexperienced, diagnosis of wandering spleen can be missed. A 22-nulligravida unmarried Sindhi female had presented to the Emergency Room (ER) with a 5-day history of intermittent severe lower abdominal pain. An ultrasound at a local practitioner had suggested an ovarian cyst. Ultrasound-pelvis and later CT scan at our facility reported an enlarged wandering spleen with torsion of its pedicle and infarction. Exploratory laparotomy with splenectomy was done. An enlarged wandering spleen was found with torsion of the splenic vein and thrombosed arterial supply from omentum wrapped over the mass. The patient developed thrombocytosis post-surgery but otherwise did well and was discharged after 2 days. Splenic torsion secondary to a wandering spleen can be challenging to diagnose, especially in resource limited settings where ultrasound might be the only modality available. Timely diagnosis and proper intervention are key to saving the life and the spleen."

We aimed to validate these prediction rules for children presenting to emergency departments with blunt abdominal or minor head trauma. For this prospective validation study, we enrolled children and adolescents younger than 18 years presenting to six emergency departments in Sacramento (CA), Dallas (TX), Houston (TX), San Diego (CA), Los Angeles (CA), and Oakland (CA), USA between Dec 27, 2016, and Sept 1, 2021. We excluded patients who were pregnant or had pre-existing neurological disorders preventing examination, penetrating trauma, injuries more than 24 h before arrival, CT or MRI before transfer, or high suspicion of non-accidental trauma. Children presenting with blunt abdominal trauma were enrolled into an abdominal trauma cohort, and children with minor head trauma were enrolled into one of two age-segregated minor head trauma cohorts (younger than 2 years vs aged 2 years and older). Enrolled children were clinically examined in the emergency department, and CT scans were obtained at the attending clinician's discretion. All enrolled children were evaluated against the variables of the pertinent PECARN prediction rule before CT results were seen. The primary outcome of interest in the abdominal trauma cohort was intra-abdominal injury undergoing acute intervention (therapeutic laparotomy, angiographic embolisation, blood transfusion, intravenous fluid for ≥2 days for pancreatic or gastrointestinal injuries, or death from intra-abdominal injury). In the age-segregated minor head trauma cohorts, the primary outcome of interest was clinically important traumatic brain injury (neurosurgery, intubation for >24 h for traumatic brain injury, or hospital admission ≥2 nights for ongoing symptoms and CT-confirmed traumatic brain injury; or death from traumatic brain injury). 7542 children with blunt abdominal trauma and 19 999 children with minor head trauma were enrolled. The intra-abdominal injury rule had a sensitivity of 100·0% (95% CI 98·0-100·0; correct test for 145 of 145 patients with intra-abdominal injury undergoing acute intervention) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100·0% (95% CI 99·9-100·0; correct test for 3488 of 3488 patients without intra-abdominal injuries undergoing acute intervention). The traumatic brain injury rule for children younger than 2 years had a sensitivity of 100·0% (93·1-100·0; 42 of 42) for clinically important traumatic brain injuries and an NPV of 100·0%; 99·9-100·0; 2940 of 2940), whereas the traumatic brain injury rule for children aged 2 years and older had a sensitivity of 98·8% (95·8-99·9; 168 of 170) and an NPV of 100·0% (99·9-100·0; 6015 of 6017). The two children who were misclassified by the traumatic brain injury rule were admitted to hospital for observation but did not need neurosurgery. The PECARN intra-abdominal injury and traumatic brain injury rules were validated with a high degree of accuracy. Their implementation in paediatric emergency departments can therefore be considered a safe strategy to minimise inappropriate CT use in children needing high-quality care for abdominal or head trauma.

    "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is a rare condition characterized by gas-filled cysts that develop in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the digestive tract. PCI is typically a benign disease but complications can occur that require surgical intervention. This patient presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of abdominal and back pain. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis led to suspicion of free intraperitoneal air potentially due to bowel perforation, and exploratory laparotomy was indicated. Bowel perforation was ruled out during the procedure, but outpouchings of air-filled cysts were found throughout the small bowel's external surface, leading to the diagnosis of PCI. Distinguishing free intraperitoneal air from PCI on imaging presents a challenge to clinicians. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT is the preferred imaging modality, but PCI remains difficult to diagnose on imaging alone. Spreading awareness of the typical benign nature of PCI alongside the common presentation on imaging may lead to earlier detection, better treatment outcomes, and prevention of unnecessary surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "With the implementation of early reperfusion therapy, the number of complications in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has diminished significantly. However, ACS patients are still routinely admitted to units with high-level monitoring such as the coronary or intensive care unit (CCU/ICU). The cost of these admissions is high and there is often a shortage of beds. The aim of this study was to analyze the complications in contemporary emergency department (ED) patients with ACS and to map patient management. This observational study was a secondary analysis of data collected in the ESC-TROP trial (NCT03421873) that included 26,545 consecutive chest pain patients ≥18 years at five Swedish EDs. Complications were defined as the following within 30 days: death, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, severe ventricular arrhythmia, high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block that required a pacemaker, and mechanical complications such as papillary muscle rupture, cardiac tamponade, or ventricular septum defects (VSDs). Complications were identified via diagnosis and/or intervention codes in the database, and manual chart review was performed in cases with complications. Of all 26,545 patients, 2,463 (9.3%) were diagnosed with ACS, and 151 of these (6.1%) suffered any complication within 30 days. Mean age was higher in patients with (79.2 years) than without (69.4 years) complications, and more were female (39.7% vs. 33.0%). Eighty-four (3.4% of all ACS patients) patients died, 33 (1.3%) had cardiac arrest, 22 (0.9%) respiratory failure, 13 (0.5%) high-degree AV block, 10 (0.4%) cardiogenic shock, 12 (0.5%) severe ventricular arrhythmia, and 2 each (<0.1%) had VSD or cardiac tamponade. Almost 30% of the complications were present already at the ED, and 40% of patients with complications were not admitted to the CCU/ICU. Only 80 (53%) of the patients with complications underwent coronary angiography and 62 (41%) were revascularized with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. With current care, serious complications occurred in only 6 out of 100 ACS patients, and 2 of these complications were present already at the ED. Four out of 10 ACS patients with complications were not admitted to the CCU/ICU and about half did not undergo coronary angiography. Further research is needed to improve risk assessment in ED ACS patients, which may allow more effective use of cardiac monitoring and hospital resources."

    "abstract": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients are at risk of creating potential spaces for possible internal hernias during the procedure. During pregnancy, the pregnant uterus elevates the bowel, increasing intra-abdominal pressure. Cases reported to date have described mild abdominal pain and no evidence of peritoneal irritation, with inconclusive ultrasound and MRI findings for diagnosis of Petersen's hernia. We present the case of a 42-year-old female patient with a history of RYGB eight years earlier without complications, with a pregnancy of 34 weeks of gestation. Symptomatology began with colicky abdominal pain in the epigastric, with irradiation to the right upper quadrant. On physical examination, revealed a painful abdomen on the median and deep palpation in the epigastric and right upper quadrant, the rest of the studies were inconclusive. As there was no improvement of the symptoms in 12 hours, an emergency diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, finding a strangulated Petersen's hernia requiring resection, with the closure of the gastric pouch, intestinal anastomosis, and Stamm gastrostomy with closure of the mesenteric gap. Therefore, a pregnant patient presenting with upper quadrant abdominal pain with a history of RYGB, even one with normal labs and imaging, should be assumed to have an internal hernia until proven otherwise. The emergency surgical approach is associated with early resolution and prevents its progression with catastrophic results."

The serial focused assessment with sonography in trauma (sFAST) examination is a potential alternative to improve pediatric trauma evaluation. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of sFAST in pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma. We performed a multicenter, retrospective observational study of electronic medical records, trauma registry data, and image archiving records of previous sFAST examinations. Examinations from pediatric patients (18 years or younger) who presented to an emergency department with blunt abdominal trauma were eligible for inclusion as long as the period between the first and second FAST was at least 30 minutes but no more than 24 hours. Demographic data and patient and outcomes were collected. Data collected from 3 institutions found a total of 38 sFAST performed between July 2017 and September 2021 on eligible patients. Of these, there were 6 (15.4%) FAST examinations that were positive after an initial negative or indeterminate interpretation. The overall sensitivity and specificity of sFAST were 66.7% (95% confidence interval 22.3-95.7%) and 93.8% (79.2-99.3%), respectively. This pilot study found that sFAST can enhance blunt trauma evaluation and improve sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy.

The patient reported no abdominal pain or fever, and examination revealed no other signs of peritonitis. An erect chest X-ray showed air under the diaphragm, and a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed free intraperitoneal air in the abdomen. The patient underwent a prompt exploratory laparotomy to assess for abdominal perforation, but the findings were negative. He had an uneventful post-operative hospital course and was discharged nine days after admission.

    "title": "A Retrospective Analysis of Needle Thoracostomies at a Tertiary Level 2 Trauma Center.",
    "abstract": "A tension pneumothorax is a condition that results in elevated pressure within the pleural space. The effective management of tension pneumothorax relies on needle decompression, commonly performed at the second intercostal space (ICS) midclavicular line (MCL). However, some literature suggests that catheters placed in the second intercostal space midclavicular line are prone to higher failure rates compared to the fifth intercostal space midaxillary line (MAL) (42.5% versus 16.7%, respectively). In this study, we aim to identify and scrutinize the prevalence of prehospital needle decompression from one tertiary care center over eight years and examine their trends, efficacies, or pitfalls. It is hypothesized that preclinical providers are performing needle decompression prematurely and unnecessarily. A set of 90 patient records obtained using the trauma registry at Saint Francis Hospital, Tulsa, Oklahoma, were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the management and outcomes of tension pneumothorax, as well as the indications documented for needle decompression. Patient charts were reviewed via Epic Hyperspace (Epic, Madison, WI). The Oklahoma Emergency Medical Service Information System (OKEMSIS) also provided information contributing to the sample population. The most documented indications for needle decompressions included diminished or absent breath sounds (52.70%), hypoxia (15.54%), hypotension, and hemodynamic instability (6.76%). Emergency medical services (EMS) reported improvements in 51 (56.67%) patients after needle thoracostomy. Improvements in vital signs after needle decompression were sporadic. The most common complication was catheter dislodging, which occurred most in the second intercostal space midclavicular line. Only nine patients had an oxygen saturation (SpO2) below 92% and a systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 100 mm Hg prior to receiving needle decompression. Current practices for tension pneumothorax show little improvement in vital signs before and after needle decompression. Vital signs prior to needle decompression often do not indicate tension pneumothorax physiology. Preclinical providers may be inappropriately performing needle decompressions, an invasive procedure with complications."

    "abstract": "Traumatic tension gastrothorax is a type of obstructive shock similar to tension pneumothorax. However, tension gastrothorax is not well known among emergency physicians, and no consensus has yet been reached on management during initial trauma care. We present a case of traumatic tension gastrothorax in which tube thoracostomy was performed based solely on clinical findings very similar to tension pneumothorax, followed by emergency laparotomy. A 24-year-old male motorcyclist was brought to our emergency medical center after being struck by a motor vehicle. He was in respiratory failure and hypotensive shock with findings suggestive of pneumothorax. Although the physical findings were not fully in line with tension pneumothorax, we immediately performed finger thoracostomy. Subsequent radiography revealed left diaphragmatic rupture with hernia. After unsuccessful attempts to decompress the stomach with a nasogastric tube, immediate emergency laparotomy was performed. During the operation, the stomach, which had prolapsed through the ruptured diaphragm into the thoracic cavity, was manually returned to the abdominal cavity. The ruptured diaphragm was repaired with sutures. Although distinguishing between tension pneumothorax and tension gastrothorax based on physical examination alone is difficult, tension gastrothorax requires careful attention to avoid intrapleural contamination from gastric injury. In addition, relying solely on stomach decompression with a nasogastric tube or delaying laparotomy could lead to cardiac arrest. When tension pneumothorax is suspected during initial trauma care, tension gastrothorax should also be considered as a differential diagnosis and treated with immediate diaphragmatic repair once identified."

Prompt intervention is crucial due to the risk of rapid bowel deterioration and increased mortality. A 45-year-old female presented with central abdominal pain associated with vomiting, abdominal distension, and obstipation. On examination, she was ill-looking with hypotension, tachycardia with a feeble pulse, direct and rebound abdominal tenderness, and absent bowel sounds. Aggressive fluid resuscitation was done. Based on the clinical presentation and abdominal radiograph suggestive of intestinal obstruction, an emergency exploratory laparotomy was done, which showed an ileocecal knot and 130 cm of gangrenous ileum. Peritoneal lavage followed by resection of non-viable ileum with double barrel ileostomy was done. Ileosigmoid, appendico-ileal, ileoileal, and ileocecal knotting are the various types of intestinal knotting, with very few cases of ileocecal knotting being reported. Intestinal knotting causes severe bowel obstruction, resulting in reduced mucosal perfusion, progressive ischemia, and peritonitis, leading to high mortality. X-ray findings of multiple air-fluid levels are non-specific, and for definitive diagnosis, laparotomy is required. Assessing bowel viability before definitive surgery is essential. Despite positive outcomes, extensive resection can lead to malabsorption and ileus, with potential risk for developing short bowel syndrome. Despite its rarity, the possibility of ileocecal knotting should be considered in cases of small bowel obstruction due to its potential for rapid deterioration. Prompt resuscitation followed by emergency laparotomy is necessary to prevent mortality."

Here, we present a case of a 72-year-old African American woman who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and precordial chest pain for three days. The patient was diagnosed with volume overload associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and subsequently admitted to the hospital. Since the patient failed to adequately respond to diuretics, hemodialysis was initiated. During the hospital stay, she developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Along with amiodarone, apixaban was started for primary stroke prophylaxis. Within 72 hours, the patient developed worsening chest pain. An echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. She was taken for an emergent open pericardial window placement to relieve cardiac tamponade, where 600 mL of blood was drained. Considering the timeline of the development of a large bloody pericardial effusion following initiation of apixaban, spontaneous hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade attributed to the use of apixaban was diagnosed. The patient was eventually taken off all anticoagulants. In considering potential mechanisms, impaired hepatic and renal metabolism of apixaban could be factored in this case. In addition, CKD can increase bleeding risk, due to platelet dysfunction and impaired interaction of von Willebrand factor with GPIIb-IIIa. Moreover, renal secretion of apixaban is mediated by p-glycoprotein and amiodarone is an inhibitor of this protein. Although extremely rare, spontaneous hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade can occur with the use of DOACs, such as apixaban. Prompt recognition and urgent treatment remain keys to avoiding adverse patient outcomes."

A significant proportion of unnatural deaths are due to penetrating thoracic trauma and preventable haemorrhage. Current indications for emergent thoracotomy are unreliable. We propose the use of lactate, shock index (SI) and base deficit (BD) as a triage tool in patients with penetrating thoracic injuries to identify those requiring surgical intervention. A review of the trauma registry of the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) was carried out between March 2011 and March 2016. Four hundred and ninety (490) patients were collected consisting of a non-operative group of 246 patients and an operative group of 244 patients. We compared lactate, SI and BD independently and within panels to ascertain which would best predict the need for operative intervention in these patients. Abnormal was defined as lactate ≥ 4 mmol/l, SI ≥ 0.8 and BD ≤ -4 mmol/l. Of the 490 patients, lactate (p < 0.001), SI (p < 0.001) and BD (p < 0.001) differed significantly between operative and non-operative groups. Statistical significance was lost (p = 0.34) once BD was analysed in combination with lactate and SI. Lactate alone was a strong predictor of the need for intervention (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.814). The strongest predictor was a combined panel of lactate and SI (AUC = 0.8308, p < 0.001). Lactate and SI in combination are useful as triage tools, and could assist in decision making, by predicting which patients are more likely to require surgical intervention."

One hundred sixty-four patients were analyzed, of which 142 were males and 22 were females. The commonest mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision, followed by falls. Grade III splenic injury was the most common injury, while the predominantly associated injury was rib fracture. The patients were managed preferably through nonoperative management, followed by angioembolization and operative management. The commonest postoperative complication was pneumonia. Nonoperative management of splenic trauma has evolved as the standard of care replacing operative management in order to sustain its immune function, thereby preventing overwhelming post-splenectomy infection."

This article summarises the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of Petersen's hernia after surgery for gastric cancer. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 11 male patients who were diagnosed with Petersen's hernia and underwent surgical treatment at our hospital from January 2020 to December 2022. Their clinical manifestations, perioperative conditions and follow-up after treatment were collected. The median age was 58.5 years (range: 45-73), and the median time since gastrectomy was 24 months (range: 4-125). Open distal gastrectomy (45.5%) and open total gastrectomy (27.3%) were the most common procedures. Roux-en-Y (81.8%) was the predominant anastomosis method. All patients underwent emergency surgery within a median time of 30 h (range: 4-45). Intestine necrosis occurred in 36.4% of cases, with a perioperative death rate of 27.3%. Petersen's hernia after gastric cancer surgery can quickly lead to necrotising intestinal obstruction and poor prognosis. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography should be performed as soon as possible, and early exploratory laparotomy should be done to avoid intestinal necrosis. Routine closure of the mesenteric defect after gastric cancer resection can prevent the occurrence of Petersen's hernia. This article highlights the need for increased awareness and preventive measures to minimise the occurrence of Petersen's hernia in gastric cancer patients. It emphasises the importance of early detection and appropriate management strategies for improved patient outcomes."

In the major bleeding cohort (n = 145; 145/7020, 2.1% of the trauma population), there were 77% men (n = 112) and 23% women (n = 33), median age 39 years [IQR 26-53] and median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 22 [IQR 13-34]. Blunt trauma dominated over penetrating trauma (58% vs. 42%) where high-energy fall was the most common blunt mechanism and knife injury was the most common penetrating mechanism. The major bleeding cohort was younger (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98 to 0.998, P = 0.012), less female gender (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.98, P = 0.04), and had more penetrating trauma (OR 4.54; 95% CI 3.24 to 6.36, P = 0.001) than the rest of the trauma cohort. A prehospital (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28; P = 0.003) and emergency department (ED) (OR 6.91; 95% CI 4.49 to 10.66, P = 0.001) systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg was associated with the major bleeding cohort as well as ED blood gas base excess < -3 (OR 7.72; 95% CI 5.37 to 11.11; P < 0.001) and INR > 1.2 (OR 3.09; 95% CI 2.16 to 4.43; P = 0.001). Emergency damage control laparotomy was performed more frequently in the major bleeding cohort (21.4% [n = 31] vs. 1.5% [n = 106]; OR 3.90; 95% CI 2.50 to 6.08; P < 0.001). There was no difference in transportation time from alarm to hospital arrival between the major bleeding cohort and the rest of the trauma cohort (47 [IQR 38;59] vs. 49 [IQR 40;62] minutes; P = 0.17). However, the major bleeding cohort had a shorter time from ED to first emergency procedure (71.5 [IQR 10.0;129.0] vs. 109.00 [IQR 54.0; 259.0] minutes, P < 0.001). In the major bleeding cohort, patients with penetrating trauma, compared to blunt trauma, had a shorter alarm to hospital arrival time (44.0 [IQR 35.5;54.0] vs. 50.0 [IQR 41.5;61.0], P = 0.013). The 24-hour mortality in the major bleeding cohort was 6.9% (10/145). All fatalities were due to blunt trauma; 40% (4/10) high energy fall, 20% (2/10) motor vehicle accident, 10% (1/10) motorcycle accident, 10% (1/10) traffic pedestrian, 10% (1/10) traffic other, and 10% (1/10) struck/hit by blunt object. In the logistic regression model, prehospital cardiac arrest (OR 83.4; 95% CI 3.37 to 2063; P = 0.007) and transportation time (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.99, P = 0.02) were associated with 24-hour mortality. Early identification of patients at high risk of major bleeding is challenging but essential for rapid definitive haemorrhage control. The major bleeding trauma cohort is a small part of the entire trauma population, and is characterized of being younger, male gender, higher ISS, and exposed to more penetrating trauma. Early identification of patients at high risk of major bleeding is challenging but essential for rapid definitive haemorrhage control."

    "abstract": "This case report describes the clinical course of a 51-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of anemia who presented to the emergency department with worsening diffuse abdominal pain and weakness two days after dental surgery. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, manifesting as tachycardia, diaphoresis, and a peritonitic abdomen. A CT scan revealed a perforated gastric ulcer, prompting emergent laparoscopy, Graham patch repair, and abdominal washout. Postoperatively, the patient developed leukocytosis, and imaging indicated the formation of an abscess. Despite initial attempts at percutaneous drainage, a subsequent exploratory laparotomy was performed. The patient's leukocytosis eventually resolved, and she was discharged after 21 days with outpatient follow-up. The discussion delves into the declining incidence of peptic ulcer disease but a constant rate of complications, emphasizing the role of factors such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. The diagnostic approach using CT scans in suspected perforated peptic ulcers is highlighted. The study also explores risk stratification scoring systems, with a preference for operative management. The laparoscopic omental patch repair (Graham patch) is discussed, citing its safety and efficacy. The case presented an uncommon occurrence of failed primary percutaneous abscess drainage, leading to subsequent surgical drainage. The discussion concludes by noting variables that may contribute to drainage failure and emphasizes the need for further research to understand such complications."

    "abstract": "Intraoperative acute cardiac tamponade associated with iatrogenic intracardiac perforation from percutaneous interventional cardiac procedures is a rare but potentially catastrophic complication. We report a case of intraoperative acute hemopericardium caused by a left atrial (LA) perforation resulting in cardiac tamponade in a patient undergoing a baffling procedure for the correction of two anomalous pulmonary veins draining into her superior vena cava (SVC) that required continuous pericardiocentesis with autologous blood transfusion via the femoral vein and an emergency intraoperative transfer from the interventional cardiology cath lab to the cardiac operating room for an open sternotomy and primary repair. An 86-year-old female with known right-ventricular (RV) failure with preserved ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 50-55% on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) one week prior) and atrial fibrillation was admitted for her third heat failure exacerbation in two months despite being adherent to her aggressive diuresis medication regimen. Upon her readmission and due to her symptomatic and seemingly refractory heart failure, the patient underwent a cardiac computer tomography (CT) with 3D reconstruction that showed previously undiagnosed partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) of two of her four pulmonary veins aberrantly draining into the SVC. This anatomic pathology was deemed to be the likely etiology of her repeated episodes of recurring heart failure exacerbations, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and fatigue. The patient was counseled and consented to a percutaneous baffle of the two anomalous veins to redirect more of the returning pulmonary venous blood away from the SVC and to the LA. While under general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) with a TEE in place during the procedure, the patient suddenly developed acute hypotension, tachycardia, and a reduction in expired carbon dioxide (EtCO2) was noted quickly followed by evidence of a rapidly accumulating hemopericardium on TEE. Cardiothoracic surgery was urgently consulted to the interventional cardiology cath lab while the patient underwent an emergency pericardiocentesis that momentarily alleviated her hemodynamic instability, cardiac tamponade physiology, and deteriorating overall clinical picture. While performing continuous pericardiocentesis with autologous return of the aspirated blood via femoral venous access the patient was urgently transported to the cardiac operating room and prepped for emergency sternotomy for primary repair of the LA. Following primary repair via sternotomy, multiple drains were placed and the thoracic cavity was closed with wires. The patient was immediately transported to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) intubated, mechanically ventilated, and sedated. During this time, the patient progressively required additional vasoactive and inotropic agents to support her mean arterial pressure (MAP), and following a multidisciplinary discussion with the patient's family regarding her goals of care, the decision was made to withdraw further resuscitation efforts and the patient expired four hours later."

It is a misnomer for mechanical intestinal obstruction caused by one or more gallstones impacted within the gastrointestinal tract lumen, which occurs mostly in the elderly and female population. Treated usually by operative enterolithotomy. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging, but CT, which is investigation of choice, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have made it easier to diagnose. A 42-year-old female presented to the emergency department with epigastric abdominal pain for 1 week, preceded by 2 months of RUQ pain. CT scan with contrast showed a classical finding of small bowel obstruction and ectopic gallstone. An emergency exploratory laparotomy, enterolithotomy, and cholecystectomy with fistula repair were performed in one surgical stage. Laparoscopic enterolithotomy alone is the most preferred method due to its low incidence of complications but one-stage or two-stage surgeries are also options, but the choice between surgical modalities depends on the patient's status. Gallstone ileus mostly affects older female patients who have a history of gallbladder disease and often have a poor prognosis that becomes worse with age and comorbidities. However, this was a young female patient with no comorbidities, which may affect the prognosis compared to those who are at risk for gallstone ileus."

We analyzed the factors affecting the decision of physicians to start prehospital blood product transfusion (PHBT) in blunt adult trauma patients. Data of all adult blunt trauma patients from the Helsinki Trauma Registry between March 2016 and July 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate analysis for the identification of predictive factors and multivariate regression analysis for their importance as predictive factors for the initiation of PHBT were applied. There were 1652 patients registered in the database. A total of 556 of them were treated by a physician-level prehospital emergency care unit, of which by transfusion-capable unit in 394 patients. PHBT (red blood cells and/or plasma) was started in 19.8% of the patients. We identified three statistically highly important clinical triggers for starting PHBT: high crystalloid volume need, shock index ≥0.9, and need for prehospital pleural decompression. PHBT in blunt adult trauma patients is initiated in ~20% of the patients in Southern Finland. High crystalloid volume need, shock index ≥0.9 and prehospital pleural decompression are associated with the initiation of PHBT, probably reflecting patients at high risk for bleeding."

    "abstract": "This case report highlights the successful management of fatal cardiac tamponade caused by intravascular intervention for central vein occlusion in hemodialysis patients. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient prognosis in such cases. We present a case involving a challenging surgical procedure to address multiple complications, emphasizing the importance of early detection and appropriate interventions. The patient, who had a history of long-term central venous catheter use for hemodialysis, was diagnosed with central vein stenosis in addition to superior vena cava occlusion, hemodialysis catheter rupture, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. Urgent ultrasound examination during surgery revealed pericardial effusion, prompting immediate pericardial drainage for stabilization. To overcome the complex challenges, we successfully performed an innominate vein-right atrial appendage bypass to restore vascular access and salvage the patient's life. The timely use of echocardiography for diagnosis and pericardial drainage contributed to stabilizing the patient's vital signs, providing an opportunity for subsequent surgical intervention. The innominate vein-right atrial appendage bypass procedure successfully relieved central vein stenosis and saved the patient's life. Although this surgical technique is not widely documented in hemodialysis patients with central venous involvement, it show cases the potential benefits for clinicians managing vascular access in this patient population. This case report underscores the need for awareness among clinicians regarding the risk of cardiac tamponade associated with intravascular intervention for central vein stenosis in hemodialysis patients. Minimizing central venous catheterization and prioritizing autogenous arteriovenous fistulas are crucial principles in preparing vascular access for hemodialysis patients. Early detection, timely interventions, and consideration of alternative surgical techniques can improve outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications."

The mortality rate of such injuries, including pre-hospitalization deaths, goes up to 90%. The most commonly injured heart chamber is the right ventricle since it takes over half of the anterior thoracic wall. The left ventricle is injured less often, but these patients usually have worse prognoses and higher mortality rates because such injuries lead to hemodynamic instability faster. We present a unique case of a suicide attempt in which the patient stabbed himself with a knife, penetrated the left ventricle, and survived even though he transected the second diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery and pulled the knife out of his chest."

A 36-year-old Black woman, referred from a peripheral health facility, presented at the emergency department with severe abdominal pains, vaginal spotting, nausea, and vomiting, with a 2-month history of irregular menstrual flow. Clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive of an acute abdomen likely due to a ruptured ectopic pregnancy (ultrasound was not available). An emergency exploratory laparotomy was done, which revealed a right adnexal ruptured interstitial pregnancy of a lifeless female fetus weighing 500 g (estimated mean gestational age of 22-23 weeks). The left fallopian tube looked normal. The site of rupture was repaired, followed by cleaning and closure of the abdomen. The post-operative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Interstitial pregnancies are uncommon and rarely attain advanced gestational ages, as in this case, compared with other tubal ectopic pregnancies. However, women presenting with signs of hypovolemic shock and acute abdomen, with a positive pregnancy test, warrant a high index of suspicion."

This study aims to assess the competency of non-radiologists in interpreting emergency chest x-rays and compare it with trainees of different levels to determine the necessity of radiologist input. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia from September to October 2023, involving 385 participants, including pediatricians and medical interns from various regions. Carefully selected questions addressed a range of x-ray abnormalities in pediatric emergencies, assessing fundamental understanding of x-ray interpretation, such as inspiratory vs. expiratory and AP or PA films. The study included 385 participants, primarily Saudi nationals in the eastern region, with an equal gender distribution and ages ranging from 20 to 29 years. Approximately 29.09% demonstrated fair knowledge, with 28% being Junior Pediatrics Residents, 18% Pediatric Consultants, and 15% Senior Pediatrics Residents. Fair knowledge was significantly associated with individuals aged 20-29 years, residents of the western region, and Junior Pediatrics Residents. Clinical knowledge varied among different groups, with 59% correctly identifying atypical pneumonia and 65% recognizing asymmetrical hyperinflation. However, rates for other conditions differed, with low identification of potential foreign body aspiration and film type. Accuracy in identifying tension pneumothorax and hyperlucency varied among clinicians. Pleural effusion films had a 65% identification rate for the diagnosis, but only 28% accurately described the X-ray and selected the correct answer for lung opacity. The study concluded that 29.9% of the participating physicians exhibited fair knowledge of common pediatric emergency radiological films. Junior pediatric residents showed the best knowledge, and Tetralogy of Fallot, asymmetrical hyperinflation, and pleural effusion had the highest recognition rates. In conclusion, there is still a need for radiologists in the pediatric emergency department to ensure optimal functioning."

    "abstract": "Persons of low socioeconomic status are overrepresented in the firearm injury patient population and may experience challenges in accessing complex outpatient health systems. Consequently, outpatient care for these patients is plagued by poor follow-up and increased emergency department (ED) utilization. We developed a Post Discharge Care Team (PDCT) consisting of a dedicated trauma nurse navigator and medical social worker to bridge the gap between hospital discharge and outpatient care to improve recovery. Adult firearm injury survivors admitted to the trauma service were randomized 1:1 to receive either PDCT services or standard of care (SOC) workflows. The PDCT nurse provided education and set expectations regarding injuries, wound care, and outpatient follow-up. The PDCT social worker performed a comprehensive assessment to identify concerns including housing and financial instability, food insecurity, or transportation issues. The primary outcome was ED utilization, with secondary outcomes including readmissions and overall health care costs compared between groups. In the first 6 months of the study, a total of 44 patients were randomized to PDCT and 47 to SOC. There were 10 patients who visited the ED in the PDCT group compared with 16 in the SOC group ( p = 0.23) for a total of 14 and 23 ED visits, respectively. There were 14 patients in the PDCT and 11 patients in the SOC groups who were readmitted ( p = 0.31), but the PDCT group was readmitted for 27.9 fewer hospital days. After accounting for programmatic costs, the PDCT had a hospital savings of $34,542.71. A collaborative, specialized PDCT for firearm injury survivors consisting of a dedicated trauma nurse navigator and medical social worker decreased outpatient ED utilization, readmission days, and was cost effective. Trauma centers with high volumes of penetrating trauma should consider a similar model to improve outpatient care for firearm injury survivors. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level III."

    "abstract": "Acute type A aortic intramural hematoma (ATAIMH) is a variant of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD), exhibiting an increased risk of hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade. It can be life-threatening without emergency treatment. However, comprehensive studies of the clinical features and surgical outcomes of preoperative hemopericardium in patients with ATAIMH remain scarce. This retrospective study aims to investigate the clinical features and early and late outcomes of patients who underwent aortic repair surgery for ATAIMH complicated with preoperative hemopericardium. We investigated 132 consecutive patients who underwent emergency ATAIMH repair at this institution between February 2007 and August 2020. These patients were dichotomized into the hemopericardium (n = 58; 43.9%) and non-hemopericardium groups (n = 74; 56.1%). We compared the clinical demographics, surgical information, postoperative complications, 5-year cumulative survival rates, and freedom from reoperation rates. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to identify independent risk factors for patients who underwent re-exploration for bleeding. In the hemopericardium group, 36.2% of patients presented with cardiac tamponade before surgery. Moreover, the hemopericardium group showed higher rates of preoperative shock and endotracheal intubation and was associated with an elevated incidence of intractable perioperative bleeding, necessitating delayed sternal closure for hemostasis. The hemopericardium group exhibited higher blood transfusion volumes and rates of re-exploration for bleeding following surgery. However, the 5-year survival (59.5% vs. 75.0%; P = 0.077) and freedom from reoperation rates (93.3% vs. 85.5%; P = 0.416) were comparable between both groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that hemopericardium, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and delayed sternal closure were the risk factors for bleeding re-exploration. The presence of hemopericardium in patients with ATAIMH is associated with an elevated incidence of cardiac tamponade and unstable preoperative hemodynamics, which could lead to perioperative bleeding tendencies and high complication rates. However, patients of ATAIMH complicated with hemopericardium undergoing aggressive surgical intervention exhibited long-term surgical outcomes comparable to those without hemopericardium."

    "abstract": "Resilient system performance in high-stakes settings, which includes the ability to monitor, respond, anticipate, and learn, can be enhanced for trainees through simulation of realistic scenarios enhanced by augmented reality. Active learning strategies can enhance simulation-based training, particularly the mental model articulation principle where students are prompted to anticipate what will happen next and the reflection principle where students self-assess their performance compared to a gold standard expert model. In this paper, we compared simulation-based training for trauma care with and without active learning strategies during pauses in the simulated action for progressively deteriorating patients. The training was conducted online and real-time without a facilitator, with 42 medical students viewing training materials and then immediately taking an online quiz for three types of trauma cases: hemorrhage, airway obstruction, and tension pneumothorax. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition in a between-subjects design. We compared performance in the control and experimental conditions based on: A) the proportion of cues correctly recognized, B) the proportion of accurate diagnoses, C) the proportion of appropriate treatment interventions, and D) verbal briefing quality on a 1-5 scale. We found that the training intervention increased recognition of subtle cues critical for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment interventions; the training did not improve the accuracy of diagnoses or the quality of the verbal briefing. We conclude that incorporating active learning strategies in simulation-based training improved foundational capabilities in detecting subtle cues and intervening to rescue deteriorating patients that can increase the readiness for trainees to contribute to resilient system performance in the high-stakes setting of emergency care in hospitals."

This retrospective study included 60 adult patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy for perforation peritonitis. The clinical details, ASA PS classification, laboratory investigations and postoperative course of patients were retrieved from their medical records. Based on these details, APACHE II and ACS-NSQIP were calculated for the patients. The study's primary outcome was the accuracy of the preoperative APACHE II, ACS-NSQIP risk calculator and ASA PS class in predicting the postoperative 30-day mortality of patients. The area under the curve (AUC) of APACHE II, ACS-NSQIP score, and ASA PS classification for mortality 30 days after surgery was 0.737, 0.694 and 0.601, respectively. The P value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test of scoring systems was 0.05, 0.25 and 0.05, respectively. AUC for postoperative complications was 0.799 for APACHE II, 0.683 for ACS-NSQIP and 0.601 for ASA PS classification. H-L test of these scoring systems for complications after surgery revealed P values of 0.62, 0.36 and 0.53, respectively. Compared to the ACS-NSQIP and ASA PS classification system, the APACHE II score has a better discriminative ability for postoperative complications and mortality in adult patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Despite being the longest and containing a greater proportion of the gastrointestinal tract's mucosal surface area, the small bowel is where <2 % to 5 % of gastrointestinal cancers can occur. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is the rarest risk factor for the development of small intestinal cancers. Here we report a case of perforated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the jejunum for which Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is identified. A 25-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with generalized peritonitis caused by a perforated jejunal mass. The patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy. There was 800 ml of thin pus in the peritoneal cavity and 5 cm by 6 cm perforated mass over the jejunum which extends to the mesentery. Palpable intraluminal polyps with an inverted serosal surface for some of them were identified. The pus was sucked out, and the mass was resected with its mesenteric lymph nodes and segments containing polyps. Subsequently, end-to-end hand-sewn anastomosis was performed, and the abdomen was closed. The histopathology report showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, stage IIIC (PT3, PN2), and Peutz-Jeghers polyps, suggesting Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Even though small bowel malignancy is a rare entity, early detection is a challenging issue, especially when it happens below the ligaments of the trietz. Surgical resection offers the only potential cure for small bowel malignancy. We conclude that patients with long-term, nonspecific abdominal complaints are good candidates for evaluation and investigation without overlooking small bowel malignancy. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome was a potential risk factor in our case."

    "abstract": "Advanced and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) presenting with surgical emergencies are rare. Neoadjuvant imatinib being the treatment of choice for non-metastatic advanced disease with a proven role in downstaging the disease may not be feasible in patients presenting with bleeding and obstruction. We present a case series with retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients with advanced and metastatic GISTs presenting with surgical emergencies. Clinical characteristics, imaging and endoscopic findings, surgical procedures, histological findings, and outcomes in these patients were studied. Four patients were included in this case series, with three males and one female (age range: 24-60 years). Two patients presented with melena; one with hemodynamic instability despite multiple blood transfusions underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy for bleeding gastric GIST, while the other underwent surgical exploration after careful evaluation given the recurrent, metastatic disease with a stable metabolic response on six months of imatinib. One patient with metastatic jejunal GIST who presented with an umbilical nodule and intestinal obstruction was given a trial of non-operative management for 72 hours, but due to non-resolution of obstruction, segmental jejunal en bloc resection with the dome of the urinary bladder with reconstruction and metastasectomy was needed. The patient with advanced gastric GIST who presented with gastric outlet obstruction was resuscitated, and an attempt of endoscopic naso-jejunal tube placement was tried, which failed, and exploration was needed. The mean length of hospital stay was 7.5 days. Histopathological examination confirmed GIST in all four patients with microscopic negative resection margins. All patients were started on imatinib with dose escalation to 800 mg in the patient with recurrent and metastatic disease; however, the patient with bleeding gastric GIST experienced severe adverse effects of imatinib and discontinued the drug shortly. All four patients are disease-free on follow-ups of 15 months, 48 months for the patient with advanced non-metastatic disease, and six and 24 months for the patients with metastatic disease. In the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for advanced and metastatic disease, upfront surgery is usually reserved for surgical emergencies only. Surgical resection, the cornerstone for the treatment of resectable GIST, may also be clinically relevant in metastatic settings, although it requires a careful and individualized approach."

    "abstract": "Intimomedial mucoid degeneration is a rare vascular disorder first depicted in 1977. It involves mucin deposition in arterial layers. This will cause elastic tissue degeneration and aneurysm formation. This pathology predominantly affects the aorta. However, it could involve other smaller vessels. Surgical treatment could become complicated by a bleeding diathesis. Therefore, a precise surgical technique is necessary to avoid the ensuing complications. We present the case of a previously healthy 27-year-old Middle Eastern male who presented to our surgical clinic following the incidental discovery of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm following a blunt trauma to the left flank incurred during a fall. Preoperative radiology unveiled a dissecting an infrarenal aortic aneurysm with a concurrent dissection flap at the left renal artery level. Furthermore, an additional dissection flap was observed at the abdominal aortic bifurcation devoid of thrombosis. We planned to perform a bilateral aortoiliac bypass. However, due to the fragility of the artery wall, bleeding diathesis, and the tearing that occurred due to the anastomotic suture, the irreparable tear in the anastomosis complicated the situation, we decided to ligate the aorta and perform an axillary-bi-femoral bypass. Intimomedial mucoid degeneration presenting as a dissecting infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm is an exceptionally rare pathology. This underscores the crucial need for extensive epidemiological research to document and raise awareness about these cases. Our literature review confirms that our case is the first documented instance in our country, and this emphasizes the significance of our findings."

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to describe trauma injuries associated with rope bullfights in the Azores, Portugal, regarding the cause of the incident, trauma mechanism, most affected anatomical areas, and injury severity. Two-year cross-sectional study in the local hospital with prospective data collection. Patients who were consecutively admitted to the local hospital's emergency department with trauma injuries from the bull's direct impact or from falls either during the bull's escape or when handling the rope, were included. Data on general demographics, lesion characteristics, treatments, need for hospitalization and mortality were collected. Fifty-six incidents and 80 trauma injuries were identified. The main cause of trauma was the bull's direct impact (37; 66.07%) and the mechanism of injury was blunt trauma in all patients (100%; 56). Head and neck injuries (27; 33.75%) were the most common. The median Injury Severity Score at the emergency department admission was 4. Major trauma was noted in five patients (8.92%). Ten patients (17.85%) needed hospitalization with a median hospital stay of seven days. Three of the 10 hospitalized patients (30%) were previously admitted to the intensive care unit. Surgery was performed in six patients (10.71%). The main cause of trauma was the bull's direct impact, and the mechanism of injury was blunt trauma. The most affected anatomical areas were the head and neck. These findings are a wake-up call to the impact of these events regarding the economic costs they entail, the costs for the health of the local population, the safety measures currently implemented and the availability of the necessary means to treat these patients.

    "abstract": "Cecal volvulus is a rare, life-threatening form of bowel obstruction caused by the entanglement of the bowel around the mesenteric axis, compromising blood supply and leading to obstruction and ischemia. The diagnosis is challenging due to its highly variable clinical presentation and differential diagnoses, which may delay timely intervention. This is a case report of an 89-year-old woman who presented with a two-day history of lower right quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and a temporary loss of consciousness. She also reported a history of chronic constipation. Clinical examination and imaging were suggestive of bowel obstruction, prompting further investigation. Plain radiography and abdominal CT confirmed bowel obstruction, with suspicion of volvulus. The diagnostic uncertainty between cecal and sigmoid volvulus prompted a colonoscopy, which excluded sigmoid volvulus. Emergency laparotomy revealed cecal volvulus and a distended cecum with ischemic changes but without necrosis. A right hemicolectomy was performed, and the patient recovered well postoperatively. This case report aims to expand the medical knowledge around the topic of cecal volvulus. It underscores the challenges in diagnosing and managing this condition and emphasizes the importance of prompt recognition and surgical intervention to improve patient outcomes."

    "title": "Small Bowel Obstruction Due to Abdominal Cocoon Syndrome in Post-COVID-19 Patients.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal cocoon syndrome, also recognized as encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, is an exceedingly rare medical condition characterized by an anomalous membranous envelopment of the small bowel. Despite its clinical rarity, the precise etiology and pathogenic mechanisms of this syndrome remain elusive. This comprehensive discussion presents a case series encompassing six patients who sought medical attention in the Emergency Room, all sharing a common presentation: severe abdominal distension and persistent constipation. Intriguingly, these symptoms manifested following recent severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. Remarkably, none of these patients had significant medical histories or had undergone prior surgical interventions, rendering their cases even more enigmatic. The defining feature across all six cases emerged during exploratory laparotomy, where a consistent finding stunned the surgical team: the discovery of a thick, fibrous membrane enveloping segments of the small bowel. The surgical procedure entailed meticulous dissection and subsequent removal of this membrane, with tissue samples dispatched for histopathological evaluation. This diagnostic approach conclusively confirmed the presence of abdominal cocoon syndrome in each of these patients. The focal point of our discussion revolves around a potential connection between recent severe COVID-19 infection, intensive care unit admissions, and the subsequent development of abdominal cocoon syndrome. This intriguing association compels further inquiry to unveil the precise pathogenesis of this syndrome, particularly within the context of COVID-19. Given the diagnostic complexities associated with abdominal cocoon syndrome, this report underscores the indispensability of maintaining a heightened clinical suspicion and the significance of rigorous intraoperative assessments to ensure timely diagnosis and effective management. Abdominal cocoon syndrome represents a rare and enigmatic medical condition characterized by its uncertain etiology. Our case series tantalizingly suggests a link between recent severe COVID-19 infection and the development of this syndrome. Nevertheless, comprehensive research endeavors are warranted to unravel the intricate mechanisms that underlie this intriguing association. In light of the diagnostic challenges associated with abdominal cocoon syndrome, this report underscores the pivotal role of exploratory surgery, in the absence of definitive radiological imaging, as the cornerstone for both diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. The pursuit of further investigations into the intricate relationship between COVID-19 and abdominal cocoon syndrome may ultimately yield the critical insights needed to demystify this complex medical enigma."

    "abstract": "Penetrating cardiac injuries usually require emergent surgical intervention. Our patient presented to the trauma centre with multiple stab wounds to the neck, chest, epigastric region and abdomen. She arrived haemodynamically stable, and her initial Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma exam was negative. Her chest X-ray did not show any evident pneumothorax or haemothorax. Due to her injury pattern, she was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and neck exploration. Postoperatively, she was taken for CT and found to have a contained cardiac rupture. The injury was contained within previous scar tissue from her prior cardiac surgery. Further evaluation revealed that the injury included a penetrating stab wound to the right ventricle and a traumatic ventricular septal defect (VSD). She subsequently underwent a redo sternotomy with the repair of the penetrating stab wound and the VSD. Cardiology, intensive care, trauma surgery and cardiothoracic surgery coordinated her care from diagnosis, management and recovery. This case highlights the challenges in the management of cardiac injuries and the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach to care for complex cardiac injuries."

We describe a case of a young adult woman who presented with a four-week history of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Chest radiography revealed a significant increase in the cardiothoracic index, and transthoracic echocardiography confirmed a life-threatening cardiac tamponade that necessitated emergency pericardiocentesis and high-dose corticosteroids. Following a thorough investigation, we excluded viral infection, malignancy, tuberculosis, and other autoimmune diseases, and the patient was diagnosed with SLE based on the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria. In this case report, we also present an uncommon association between SLE and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While both are autoimmune diseases, the coexistence of these two conditions in the same patient is rare. The report highlights the need for ongoing research to better understand the optimal management strategies for patients with coexisting autoimmune conditions."

We present a case of a young female who presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and cardiac tamponade and who was found to have DSRCT. The patient was coded at the emergency department. Left heart catheterization showed normal coronary arteries, and pericardiocentesis removed 1,260 mL of bloody pericardial effusions. The patient was stabilized, and a positron emission tomography scan revealed left intrahilar, hilar, and cardiophrenic masses with associated hypermetabolic right hilar, left hilar, subcarinal, costophrenic, aortopulmonary, paratracheal, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple masses visualized in the pericardium, one mass anterior to the right ventricular outflow tract/pulmonary artery, and a second mass adjacent to the right ventricular apex. Computed tomography abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of metastatic malignancy in the abdomen/pelvis. A biopsy of lung mass and lymph nodes showed desmoplastic small round cell tumors with sarcoma fusion gene detected (Ewing sarcoma RNA-binding protein 1-Wilms' tumor 1). We performed cycle 1 of chemotherapy, including doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide, and the patient was transferred to an oncology center for further care. This case suggested that one of the differential diagnoses of lung and pericardium masses at a young age can be desmoplastic small round cell tumors. This case also highlighted that ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction can be secondary to neoplasm, especially at a young age besides myocardial infarction."

    "abstract": "Small coronary artery disease is more common in elderly patients, smokers, patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Percutaneous interventions on small coronary arteries are associated with an increased risk of complications (perforation, dissection and restenosis). Coronary artery perforation treatment includes cover stents and coil placement. A 73-year-old patient, without comorbidities, was hospitalized for acute non ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed subocclusion of the first diagonal branch (culprit lesion) while the other epicardial coronary arteries were without stenosis. Multiple predilatations of the target vessel were performed, and as it was a vessel with a diameter of less than 2 mm, no stent was placed. The final angiogram showed normal flow and good morphological result. Half an hour after the procedure, cardiac tamponade and cardiorespiratory arrest developed. Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed and after the return of spontaneous circulation, emergency recoronarography was performed. It showed perforation of the diagonal branch with contrast extravasation. Coronary coil was applied proximal to the perforation site. Perforation repair and hemodynamic stabilization were achieved. Coronary artery perforation is a life-threatening complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. The risk of perforation is higher in the case of small coronary arteries; it can be presented by delayed cardiac tamponade, which requires increased supervision of the patient."

Patients can develop complications like typhoid intestinal perforation which is associated with higher mortality. A 15-year-old female presented to the emergency pediatric unit with fever, abdominal pain and abdominal distension. She was septic, in respiratory distress, and had marked generalized abdominal tenderness with guarding. An assessment of generalized peritonitis secondary to typhoid intestinal perforation was made. She had exploratory laparotomy with intra-operative findings of ileal perforation and gastric perforation. She had repair of the intestinal and gastric perforations. Our patient presented late with concurrent use of NSAIDs and overwhelming sepsis which likely contributed to the gastric perforation as this is not a usual finding in patients with typhoid intestinal perforation. Gastric perforation is an unusual finding in patients with typhoid intestinal perforation.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, percutaneous procedures are expanding in use, and this comes with complications associated with the procedure itself. Cardiac tamponade is rare but may be life threatening since it can involve hemodynamic instability. It is known that after pleural effusion during a percutaneous procedure, pericardiocentesis should be used as drainage of the cavity. However, that does not achieve hemostasis in some cases, and in those patients who are hemodynamically unstable, a sealing agent to promote hemostasis might be useful, like thrombin. We present a case report of 89-year-old patient with history of melanoma undergoing treatment with pembrolizumab, who attended the emergency department referring chest pain (intensity 5/10) and palpitations that have lasted hours. He had TnTUs 554/566 ng/L and an echocardiogram that showed dilated right chambers, hypertrophy and global hypokinesia of the left ventricle, increased filling pressures of the left ventricle and pulmonary hypertension. Myocarditis associated with pembrolizumab was suspected, so high dose steroids were initiated and endomyocardial biopsy was conducted, resulting in iatrogenic cardiac tamponade. To determine the etiology of the suspected myocarditis, an endomyocardial biopsy was performed. Unfortunately, an intraprocedural complication arose: pleural effusion resulting in iatrogenic cardiac tamponade, leading to hemodynamic instability. It required immediate pericardial drainage via subxiphoid puncture, obtaining a 550 mL hematic debit. Clinical manifestations raised suspicion of tamponade, prompting a bedside echocardiogram for a definitive diagnosis. Despite these efforts, the patient remained hemodynamically unstable, and due to the elevated surgical risk, intrapericardial thrombin was employed to achieve successful hemostasis. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that can sometimes be induced iatrogenically, resulting from percutaneous interventions. Despite limited evidence regarding this therapeutic strategy, in patients experiencing iatrogenic cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic instability and high surgical risk, the administration of intra-pericardial thrombin could be contemplated."

Diagnosis, often requiring surgical exploration, poses challenges due to the condition's rarity and severity. We report a complex case of a patient with multiple gunshot wounds, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach for abdominal and genitourinary regions. A 24-year-old male presented to the emergency department with multiple gunshot wounds to the anterior thoracic and abdominal walls, inguinal region, penis, and lower extremities. Despite multiple gunshot wounds, the patient maintained hemodynamic stability during physical examination. No imaging study was performed since surgical management was decided due to the presence of hematemesis. During exploratory laparotomy, a 2 cm stomach lesion was found and repaired by the general surgery team. Urology then addressed genital trauma, identifying and fixing a 1 cm tunica albuginea defect in each corpora cavernosa, achieving bilateral penile fracture repair. The patient was discharged after eight days of hospitalization, with adequate oral intake and urinating. Fifty-two days later, he persists with mild erectile dysfunction (International Index of Erectile Function-5 score: 17 points). This unique case involving a gunshot-induced penile fracture alongside abdominal and several other injuries was successfully managed through a multidisciplinary approach. As these lesions are rare, prompt treatment with standardized surgical procedures for civilian cases is crucial for optimal outcomes."

Infectious pericarditis is rare and associated with high morbidity and mortality. We present a case of acute RT-induced pericarditis complicated by bacterial pericarditis and cardiac tamponade due to oesophageal bacterial translocation. A 65-year-old man with a recurrent mediastinal sarcoma complicated by oesophageal compression and recent oesophageal stenting presented with shortness of breath. Electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevations, and he was diagnosed with presumed RT-induced pericarditis. Despite anti-inflammatory therapy, he developed haemodynamic instability and clinical tamponade, with transthoracic echocardiogram showing a large circumferential pericardial effusion. He underwent emergent pericardiocentesis, and pericardial fluid cultures grew polymicrobial species. Anti-inflammatories were held, and he was started on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and antifungals. Due to clinical decompensation and repeat computed tomography imaging demonstrating worsening pericardial disease, he underwent pericardial irrigation and subxiphoid pericardial window. The patient died from hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Autopsy revealed constrictive pericarditis and no bacterial organisms in the pericardium. Anti-inflammatories are standard treatment for viral and RT-induced pericarditis. Purulent, bacterial pericarditis is rare and an uncommon complication of RT-induced pericarditis. Polymicrobial infectious pericarditis is often refractory to intravenous antibiotics, requiring surgical intervention. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion of various potential aetiologies of pericarditis in order to tailor medical and surgical therapies especially in high-risk, immunosuppressed cancer patients."

We report a case of a 67-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department after falling down a 14-step staircase at home which presented right kidney trauma (parenchyma laceration with a perirenal hematoma) on computed tomography, and hematuria. Considering the patient's hemodynamic stability, a non-operative treatment was initiated, and the patient was referred to the intensive care unit for close observation. On post-trauma day 3, a repeated CT revealed right renal vein thrombosis. After evaluation, it was decided to maintain prophylactic anticoagulation doses of enoxaparin (40 mg/day) due to the elevated risk of bleeding in high-grade renal trauma and planned an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. In the following days, the hematuria resolved spontaneously and an IVC filter was placed. The patient progressed with no complaints, spontaneous diuresis, improvement in laboratory parameters, and cardiovascular stability, which led to his discharge on day 12 with rivaroxaban 10 mg/day. The patient was successfully treated with a non-operative approach, and the RVT disappeared after 35 days. Post-traumatic renal vein thrombosis is a rare occurrence, and due to the infrequent nature of these events, specific management guidelines are not fully established, particularly when thrombosis is confirmed in an acutely injured patient. Conservative therapy seems to play a meaningful role in trauma-related renal vein thrombosis treatment."

The authors report the frequency and characteristics of combat-related penetrating VA injuries and the indications for endovascular treatment, as well as analyze their treatment outcomes. A 1-year prospective study was completed at a civilian medical center in Dnipro, Ukraine, in all patients with VA injuries sustained during the Russian invasion in the 1st year of war. The authors evaluated the location, type, and severity of the VA injuries and concomitant injuries, as well as the type of intervention and outcomes at 1 month. In total, 279 wounded patients underwent cerebral angiography and 30 (10.8%) patients had VA injuries. All patients were male. There were 28 soldiers and 2 civilians with a mean age of 37.5 years. Four (13.3%) patients had Bissl grade I injuries, 4 (13.3%) had grade II injuries, 4 (13.3%) had grade III injuries (pseudoaneurysm), and 18 (60.0%) had grade IV injuries (occlusion). Four (13.3%) patients underwent emergency open surgical intervention. Fourteen (46.7%) patients underwent endovascular intervention. There was a significant relationship between the anatomical level of the VA injury and surgical intervention (p < 0.05). Endovascular intervention was correlated with the severity of vascular injury to the VA, with 12.5% of the patients receiving intervention for grade I and II lesions and 59.1% receiving intervention for grade III and IV lesions (p < 0.05). The overall mortality in the study group was 6.7% (n = 2), and both died of ischemic complications. In modern armed conflicts, VA injuries are much more common than reported for previous wars. With the available modern endovascular technology, cerebral angiography is warranted for suspected VA injury and allows for both the diagnosis and treatment of these injuries. Whether endovascular intervention is performed depends on the level and severity of VA injury, severity of concomitant injuries, and presence of collateral circulation."

Cardiac rupture due to TCM is a rare but fatal complication. Without cardiac surgery, 94% of patients with left ventricular free wall rupture (LVFWR) due to TCM die. Furthermore, successful surgical cases are rare. We report herein the successful treatment of multiple LVFWRs due to TCM using a sutureless repair. An 80-year-old man quarreled with his daughter and had a sudden onset of chest pain. He was transferred to our hospital in shock. Electrocardiography showed ST elevation and contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a bloody pericardial effusion. Emergent coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis. Cardiac arrest ensued because of cardiac tamponade. Emergent surgery was undertaken and three oozing lacerations on the lateral and inferior walls were noted. A sutureless repair was performed using TachoSil® patches. We also applied Surgicel Nu-Knit® absorbable hemostat with Hydrofit® where TachoSil® failed to completely adhere because of hematoma formation and achieved complete hemostasis. We diagnosed the ruptures due to TCM according to the Mayo criteria. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 71. A sutureless repair using TachoSil® patches and Surgicel® with Hydrofit® is a minimally invasive and effective method for the treatment of multiple LVFWRs due to TCM."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic trauma is one of the least observed diagnoses in the emergency room, much less in pediatric emergencies. Any cause of direct abdominal blunt trauma can cause it. With only a few cases presented in the literature, horse accidents have been associated with this complication, but it has been never seen in literature as a case where the horse-riding saddle is the one causing the pancreatic trauma, until now. Emphasizing the importance of an early diagnosis is the key point, but more importantly, to highlight that the correct diagnostic approach will grant the opportunity for a lesion in the main pancreatic duct to be identified, which will allow a timely surgical approach, increasing overall survival rates and decreasing morbidity in these patients. Here lies the importance of not only utilizing a specific study, such as a computerized tomography (CT) scan to evaluate abdominal trauma but also using other image studies that are better suited for pediatric patients, such as magnetic resonance image (MRI) with cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)."

    "title": "General Surgery Residents Improve Efficiency but Not Hospital Length of Stay in Trauma Care.",
    "abstract": "Background Good Samaritan University Hospital (GSUH) has been preliminary approved to become a Level I Trauma Center. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) requires Level I Trauma Centers to have senior surgery residents on the trauma service. To fulfill this requirement, GSUH has established an affiliation with Stony Brook University Hospital, a tertiary care hospital with an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved five-year postgraduate training program in General Surgery, to have senior surgery residents from their training program rotate and provide care to trauma patients beginning in July of 2021. Numerous studies over the past few decades have shown conflicting results on patient outcomes with resident involvement. A majority of the studies published only evaluated residents who were native to the respective hospitals. Our study evaluated the impact of surgery residents visiting from an outside hospital on hospital length of stay (LOS) in admitted trauma patients. As increased hospital LOS is strongly associated with increased hospital-acquired complications, increased healthcare costs, and poor patient experience, we used this to evaluate the efficiency of our trauma team with the addition of visiting surgery residents. Methodology A retrospective study was conducted utilizing the hospital's trauma registry. Patients were divided into two groups: the first two years before the addition of surgery residents from July 1st, 2019, to June 30th, 2021, and the second two years after the addition of surgery residents from July 1st, 2021, to June 30th, 2023. The primary outcome measured the hospital LOS between the two groups. Pearson's chi-square test was used to analyze all categorical data, and a t-test was used to compare differences in means. Results From July 1st, 2019, to June 30th, 2023, a total of 7,081 patients were admitted to the trauma service: 3,411 in the group with no surgery residents, and 3,670 patients in the group with residents (p = 0.052). The primary outcome, hospital LOS, was not significantly affected by the addition of surgery residents to the trauma service. Hospital LOS before surgery residents was 4.40 days compared to with residents at 4.41 days (p = 0.944). Mortality was significantly decreased with resident involvement at 1.9% compared to no residents at 2.7% (p = 0.017). Interestingly, the Emergency Department LOS was significantly longer in the group with residents, 268.82 minutes vs. 232.19 minutes (p = 0.004). The average New Injury Severity Score was 9.02 in the group with no residents and 9.04 in the group with surgery residents (p = 0.927). The majority of traumas in both groups were blunt trauma 96.5% with no residents vs. 97.1% with residents (p = 0.192). Conclusions The addition of visiting surgery residents to the trauma team did not significantly increase hospital LOS. Ultimately, having visiting residents on the trauma service may enhance resident education without compromising hospital LOS. Training at different hospitals can allow residents to experience different patient populations and different hospital protocols, making them adaptable and more prepared to work in different hospital settings, whether academic or community. Hospitals without their own residency programs could potentially form affiliations with residency programs to meet the ACS requirements, which can bring more patients to their hospitals."

    "title": "Assessing the prediction of arterial CO2 from end tidal CO2 in adult blunt trauma patients.",
    "abstract": "The control of PaCO2 in ventilated patients is known to be of particular importance in the management and prognosis of trauma patients. Although EtCO2 is often used as a continuous, non-invasive, surrogate marker for PaCO2 in ventilated trauma patients in the emergency department (ED), previous studies suggest a poor correlation in this cohort. However, previous data has predominantly been collected retrospectively, raising the possibility that the elapsed time between PaCO2 sampling and EtCO2 recording may contribute to the poor correlation. As such this study aimed to analyse the correlation of PaCO2 to EtCO2 in the ventilated blunt trauma patient presenting to the ED through contemporaneous sampling. This study was conducted as a prospective observational study analysing the near simultaneous recording of EtCO2 and Arterial Blood Gas sampling of ventilated adult trauma patients in the ED of a Level 1 trauma centre over a 12-month period. Data was analysed using linear regression and subgroup analysis by Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) of the Chest. Linear regression of EtCO2 vs PaCO2 demonstrated a moderate correlation with r = 0.54 (p < 0.01, n = 51, 95 % CI 0.31-0.71). Subgroup analysis by ISS, revealed a stronger correlation in those with minor ISS (0-11) (r = 0.76, p < 0.01, n = 13, 95 % CI 0.36-0.92) compared to those more severely injured patients (ISS > 15) (r = 0.44, P < 0.01, n = 38, 95 % CI 0.14-0.67). Analysis by AIS Chest demonstrated similar correlation between patients without chest injuries (AIS 0) (r = 0.55, n = 29, p < 0.01, 95 % CI 0.23-0.76) and those with an AIS >1 (r = 0.51, n = 22, p = 0.02, 95 % CI 0.11-0.77). In patients with traumatic head injuries who had an EtCO2 between 30 and 39 mmHg, only 57 % had a measured PaCO2 within 5 mmHg. As patients transition from minor to seriously injured, a decreasing strength of PaCO2 to EtCO2 correlation is observed, decreasing the reliability of EtCO2 as a surrogate marker of PaCO2 in this patient group. This inconsistency cannot be accounted for by the presence of chest injuries and worryingly is frequently seen in those with traumatic brain injuries."

Iatrogenic tracheobronchial injury (TBI) is a rare and devastating complication which need prompt diagnosis and management. An 11-year-old child was brought to the emergency with a history of cough and chest discomfort for the last 15 days. Chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) chest were done which showed the presence of a FB in the right main bronchus. After all pre-operative investigations, rigid bronchoscopy and removal of the foreign body under general anesthesia was performed. After several attempts, the foreign body couldn't be removed and there was massive surgical emphysema of the chest. Immediately bilateral chest tube was inserted. A repeat CT chest was done which revealed a ruptured of the right main bronchus with migration of the foreign body to the right pleural cavity. Right thoracotomy was performed under general anesthesia. The foreign body was removed and the bronchus ruptured was repaired. The child's vital signs were normal throughout the procedure and she was discharged on the seventh post-operative day. TBI can have devastating scenarios in the absence of quick diagnosis and treatment. Around 80 % of patients with TBI due to accidents have been found to have fatal outcomes before reaching the hospital, probably due to tension pneumothorax, hypoxia, or respiratory failure. Prompt diagnosis and management of complications with definitive repair of the injury were key elements in saving lives after TBI."

    "abstract": "The efficacy of intraoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in visualizing a patient's small bowel interior to detect injuries or lesions, or conduct a leak test post-bowel anastomosis, makes it a preferred option among surgeons. However, it is not always available, can carry a risk of morbidity and mortality, or can prolong operative time if not performed by a proficient team. A 21-year-old male patient came to the emergency department with four gunshot wounds to his abdomen, with two on either side of the abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and through and through injuries were identified in the small bowel and at the junction of the third/fourth portion of the duodenum. It was challenging to gather the patient's past medical history, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding history, due to the underlying medical condition. However, the patient had experienced a retroperitoneal bowel injury in the setting of duodenal hematoma that was not immediately identified at first glance. In this context, intraoperative endoscopy could be a significant adjunct to detect retroperitoneal bowel injury if rapidly available and in a controlled scenario. Moreover, the advantages of intraoperative EGD increase with positive collaboration between a general surgeon and a gastroenterologist."

    "title": "A Case of Long-Tract Ileocolic Intussusception Secondary to Well-Differentiated Cecal Adenocarcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Intussusception denotes the intricate phenomenon wherein one segment of the bowel undergoes invagination or telescoping into its contiguous distal segment. The ensuing invaginated segment may be propelled forward through peristaltic movements, potentially precipitating bowel obstruction or ischemia, culminating in necrosis of the affected bowel segment. Although the precise etiology of intussusception remains elusive, particularly in cases devoid of an identifiable lead point, dysrhythmic contractions and lymphoid hyperplasia have been implicated in the pathophysiology of this condition. We present the case of an 86-year-old African American female with a past medical history of hypertension and asthma who presented to our emergency room with a seven-day history of worsening abdominal. The pain was described as sharp and intermittent, and it would worsen with every meal or drink. A physical exam demonstrated the right lower quadrant with vague abdominal tenderness, especially below the umbilical region. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a long segment of ileocolic obstructing intussusception in the ascending colon, with a 2.6 cm solid mass serving as a lead point. Swift intervention ensued with an urgent exploratory laparotomy, culminating in a right hemicolectomy to excise the intussuscepted segment of the bowel. The pathological examination identified a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cecum, categorized as T1N0M0, with all 20 resected lymph nodes yielding negative results. This illustrative case presents a unique insight into a patient with ileocolic obstructing intussusception, caused by a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma acting as the lead point, a relatively uncommon occurrence in adults. Diagnosing intussusception in adults is challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms, which are similar to those of various other gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, it is crucial for medical providers to be acutely aware of the possibility that adenocarcinoma can trigger obstructing intussusception in various parts of the bowel."

This case presentation highlights a rare example of idiopathic intussusception in a young male adult. Our patient is a 23-year-old African American male who presented at the Piedmont Macon Medical Center emergency department in February 2023 with acute-onset severe periumbilical pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was inconclusive, and his diagnosis of an ileo-ileal intussusception in the distal ileum was made during an exploratory (diagnostic) laparoscopy. Based on a visual inspection of the bowel demonstrating no evidence of inflammation, adhesions, lesions, ischemia, or a pathological lead point, manual reduction without resection was indicated. While intussusception is rare in adults, it is an important clinical prognosis that should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis."

Recognition of respiratory distress and abdominal symptoms is crucial for intervention. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a condition characterized by the protrusion of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity due to a defect in the diaphragm. While typically observed in the neonatal period, CDH can present in later life. This case report describes the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a nine-year-old boy with 1p36 deletion syndrome who presented with respiratory distress, abdominal pain, vomiting, and anorexia. The initial diagnosis was tension pneumothorax, and thus the patient underwent chest tube placement. However, a high-resolution CT scan revealed a left hemidiaphragmatic hernia, and the patient eventually underwent an emergency laparotomy due to acute-onset respiratory distress. Intraoperatively, a diagnosis of Bochdalek hernia with gastric perforation was made, and the CDH and gastric perforations were resolved successfully. This case highlights the importance of considering late-presenting CDH as a possible diagnosis in pediatric patients with similar symptoms and the radiological findings suggestive of tension pneumothorax. Early recognition and prompt surgical intervention can lead to successful management of such cases."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal hemangiomas (GIH) are unusual vascular tumors found anywhere alongside the GI tract, the small bowel being the most common site. Diagnosis requires good clinical insight and modern imaging. This is a comprehensive review of the literature, starting from a new pediatric case diagnosed through exploratory laparotomy after complex imaging techniques failed. This research was conducted on published articles from the past 25 years. We identified seventeen original papers (two series of cases with three and two patients, respectively, and fifteen case reports). The female/male ratio was 1.5. The youngest patient was a 3-week-old boy, and the was oldest a 17-year-old girl. The most common localization was the jejunum (eight cases), followed by the ileum (four), colon (three), stomach (two), and rectum (one). Seven children had cavernous and four had capillary hemangiomas. Eight patients presented gastrointestinal bleeding, seven had refractory anemia, such as our index patient, three had recurrent abdominal pain, and two had bowel obstruction. Surgical assessment was successful in fifteen cases; three cases experienced great outcomes with oral propranolol, one child was treated successfully with sirolimus, and for one patient, endoscopic treatment was the best choice. The authors present the case of a female patient admitted to the Pediatrics Department of \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Emergency Children's Hospital from 25 February to 28 March 2019 for severe anemia, refractory to oral iron treatment, and recurrent blood infusions. No clear bleeding cause had been found. Although very uncommon, intestinal hemangiomas can express puzzling, life-threatening symptoms.

    "abstract": "Megaduodenum is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by significant duodenal dilation, elongation, and hypertrophy. Given its rarity and nonspecific clinical manifestations, megaduodenum may be misdiagnosed, leading to delays in surgical care and increased morbidity. We describe a case of idiopathic megaduodenum in a teenage Caucasian female, who presented with a five-year history of halitosis, recurrent belching, bloating, nausea and vomiting, and postprandial epigastric abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with megaduodenum by dramatic findings on contrast radiography. She developed a duodenal volvulus necessitating emergency exploratory laparotomy, during which a duodenal plication and a side-to-side duodenojejunostomy were performed. Exploratory laparotomy and histopathological analysis were unrevealing of any definitive abnormalities to explain her megaduodenum. Postoperatively, she developed two early small bowel obstructions, both from subsequent adhesions requiring repeat laparotomy with adhesiolysis. She has subsequently recovered without incident. Diagnosis and accurate classification of megaduodenum requires surgical exploration with a full-thickness biopsy and subsequent histopathologic analysis to rule out obstructive or functional disorders of the duodenum. Treatment of megaduodenum depends on the underlying cause and degree of duodenal distention. It is crucial that clinicians are knowledgeable of the various surgical options, their indications, and the potential postoperative complications that may arise."

Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a relatively rare presentation of acute onset neck pain and often presents in the context of blunt trauma. Due to the risk of subsequent clot formation and stroke, patients who present with symptoms suggestive of VAD must be promptly screened, most often first with computed tomography angiography (CTA) followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for further evaluation. We present a case of a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic neck pain who was seen in the emergency department due to acute, severe neck pain with initial CTA imaging that suggested left VAD. However, follow-up MRI of his cervical spine identified that what seemed to be a left VAD was instead multiple myeloma. This case demonstrates the utility of using multiple imaging modalities, including CT, CTA, MRI, and MRA, in diagnosing an atypical presentation of multiple myeloma and the consequences of physician implicit biases that are often involved when treating patients with chronic pain."

CT abdomen and pelvis revealed small bowel obstruction (SBO) to the mid ileum and small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. High-grade SBO was identified, caused by large obstructing phytobezoars, with three further proximal large phytobezoars identified. All four phytobezoars were extracted and found to be rehydrated pieces of dehydrated apple that had increased in size in the gastrointestinal tract.

This retrospective study included patients with blunt trauma aged ≥ 18 years who were transported directly to the tertiary care hospital between April, 2012, and March, 2021. Massive FFP transfusion was defined as a composite outcome of at least 10 units of FFP or death for any cause except for cerebral herniation, within 24 h after hospital arrival. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of predicting the need for massive FFP transfusions using FDP, D-dimer, and Fib levels at the time of hospital arrival. A total of 2160 patients were eligible for the analysis, of which 167 fulfilled the criteria for the composite outcome. The area under the curve and 95% confidence interval for FDP, D-dimer, and Fib levels were 0.886 (0.865-0.906), 0.885 (0.865-0.906), and 0.771 (0.731-0.810), respectively. When the cutoff values of FDP and D-dimer were set at 90 μg/mL and 45 μg/mL, the sensitivity values were 77% and 78%, the positive predictive values were 28% and 27%, and the negative predictive values were both 98%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity of Fib was low regardless of the cutoff value. FDP and D-dimer levels at the time of hospital arrival showed a higher predictive accuracy for the need for massive FFP transfusion than Fib."

This report presents a case of chylopericardium post-esophagectomy, resulting in cardiac tamponade and cardiac arrest. A systematic literature review was also conducted to facilitate the understanding of this rare condition. A 41-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with intermediate to highly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the mid-thoracic esophagus (clinical T4NxM0). He underwent thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis. On postoperative day 1, patient had a cardiac arrest secondary to cardiac tamponade, requiring emergency ultrasound-guided drainage. The drained fluid was initially serous but became chylous after the administration of enteral nutritional emulsion. As a result of significant daily pericardial drainage, patient subsequently underwent thoracic duct ligation. The amount of drainage was substantially reduced post-thoracic duct ligation. Over a period of 2 years and 7 months, patient recovered well and tolerated full oral diet. A comprehensive literature review was conducted and 4 reported cases were identified. Among these cases, three patients developed pericardial tamponade secondary to chylopericardium post-esophagectomy. Chylopericardium is a rare but serious complication post-esophagectomy. Prompt echocardiography and thorough pericardial fluid analysis are crucial for diagnosis. Thoracic duct ligation has been shown to be an effective management approach for this condition."

    "abstract": "A complete disruption of main pancreatic duct (MPD) presents a significant challenge to the surgeon. Historically, the standard surgical approach for addressing a complete disruption of the MPD involved distal pancreatic resection and pancreaticojejunostomy Roux-en-Y anastomosis. Nevertheless, there have been no reported cases of hybrid surgery being employed for the complete disruption of the MPD. A 63-year-old male patient presented with blunt trauma in the upper abdomen and was transferred to our trauma center 10 hours after injury. Upon arrival at the emergency department, he was conscious, hemodynamically stable, and complained of upper abdominal pain and distention. Physical examination revealed right upper abdominal tenderness and slight abdominal tension. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a complete transection of pancreatic parenchyma at the junction of the head and neck. Complete transection of pancreatic parenchyma at the junction of the head and neck combined with complete disruption of the MPD, AIS grade IV. The hybrid surgery was initially utilized for complete MPD disruption, incorporating endoscope-assisted stent placement in the MPD along with primary repair of the pancreatic parenchyma and duct. The postoperative period went smoothly, and the patient recovered and was discharged 4 weeks after operation. The MPD stent was removed under endoscope 4 months after operation, and Endoscopic Retrograde Pancreatography examination showed that the MPD was patency and slight MPD stenosis without pancreatic leakage. At the most recent follow-up, the patient had returned to normal life and work without any pancreatic endocrine or exocrine dysfunction. The hybrid surgery, incorporating endoscope-assisted MPD stent placement and primary repair of the pancreatic parenchyma and duct, emerges as a promising alternative for complete MPD disruption in hemodynamically stable patients. The challenge in this hybrid surgery is the precise localization of the distal end of the MPD."

    "abstract": "Delayed intraperitoneal bladder rupture is a rare clinical occurrence, frequently overlooked and misdiagnosed due to its nonspecific clinical manifestations. However, literature provides only a limited number of cases reporting delayed intraperitoneal bladder rupture resulting from blunt abdominal injury. A 72-year-old female pedestrian was struck by a vehicle and experienced sudden, severe abdominal pain on the 8th day following the injury. Abdominal B-ultrasound revealed a significant accumulation of peritoneal effusion. The abdominal puncture retrieved serosanguinous ascites. Then the patient was promptly transferred to our hospital. Upon transfer, the physical examination revealed the patient vital signs to be stable, accompanied by mild abdominal distension, slight tenderness, tension, and an absence of rebound tenderness. Urinalysis detected microscopic hematuria, while contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed considerable fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity, without evidence of solid organ damage, and the bladder was adequately filled. The diagnosis of delayed intraperitoneal bladder rupture primarily relied on intraoperative observations. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a linear rupture at the dome of the bladder. Subsequently, the bladder rupture was repaired. Postoperative cystography demonstrated full recovery and the patient was discharged 28 days post-surgery. The postoperative recovery was uneventful without any complications. A well-distended bladder observed in CT does not definitively rule out the potential for bladder injury. False negatives may occur due to incomplete bladder filling during CT cystography. Retrograde cystography can identify cases missed by CT cystography. In cases of substantial intra-abdominal free fluid, surgical intervention should be actively considered for patients with blunt abdominal trauma without concurrent solid organ damage."

    "abstract": "This case report highlights a rare clinical scenario of a 46-year-old male presenting with constipation and fecaloid vomiting due to an impacted chicken bone within an unidentified rectosigmoid neoplasm, leading to acute malignant colonic obstruction. Emergent exploratory laparotomy revealed an impacted chicken bone lodged in a previously unknown rectosigmoid tumor. An anatomopathological examination revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma with clear margins and one pericolic metastatic lymph node. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was proposed for adjuvant chemotherapy. The abrupt onset of symptoms allowed for an early diagnosis, emphasizing the unexpected association between foreign body impaction and incidental malignant obstruction. This case underscores the complexity of managing foreign body ingestion in the gastrointestinal tract and emphasizes the crucial role of diagnostic imaging in surgical planning. Furthermore, it draws attention to the potential occurrence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals, emphasizing the necessity for clinical vigilance and screening strategies beyond conventional age recommendations."

    "abstract": "Emergency pericardiocentesis is a life-saving procedure that is performed to aspirate fluid from the pericardial space in patients who have severe pericardial effusion that is causing hemodynamic compromise. The current gold standard for pericardial fluid aspiration is ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis. Echocardiography with a low-frequency transducer has generally been used in pericardiocentesis, but this method lacks real-time visualization of the needle trajectory, leading to complications. Therefore, we describe a case involving an ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis method using a novel in-plane technique with a lateral-to-medial approach via the right parasternal and a high-frequency probe. The method was performed for an infant with cardiac tamponade. We present a case of a 14-month-old male infant who was brought to the emergency room with a history of cough, shortness of breath, and fever following recurrent chest infections. Despite prior treatments, his condition deteriorated, and signs of cardiac tamponade were evident upon examination. Cardiopulmonary point-of-care ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large pericardial effusion with tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed using the novel in-plane technique, resulting in successful fluid aspiration and stabilization of the patient's condition. The proposed technique involves positioning a high-frequency ultrasound probe over the right parasternal area to obtain real-time visualization of the needle trajectory and surrounding structures, including the sternum, right internal thoracic vessels, pleural sliding end point, pericardial effusion, and myocardium. The needle is inserted laterally to medially at a 45-degree angle, ensuring safe passage between the pleural sliding endpoint and the right internal thoracic vessels while reaching the pericardial effusion. The presented technique provides real-time visualization of the needle and surrounding structures, which may potentially help to avoid complications and improve accuracy. The proposed technique may potentially enable access for emergency pericardiocentesis and for loculated pericardial effusion that has formed around the right atrium. Nevertheless, further studies with large patient populations are needed."

    "abstract": "Long tubular duplication is a rare congenital intestinal disease, that can lead to emergency situations marked by massive hemorrhage. However, preoperative diagnosis and surgical treatment are challenging. This report presents preoperative images and details a surgical procedure for long tubular intestinal duplications with massive hemorrhage. A 3-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with melena. Despite undergoing a Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy one year prior, which revealed nonspecific findings with enhancement of some parts of the intestine, enhanced abdominal CT revealed an edematous small intestine with luminal extravasation. The patient received a transfusion of red blood cells; however, his hemoglobin level did not improve. Arterial angiography and double-balloon endoscopy revealed no remarkable findings. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a long tubular duplication in half of the small intestine. Utilizing the Wrenn procedure, we successfully removed all duplicate mucosa. Pathological findings showed that almost all duplications contained gastric mucosa and revealed an ulcer with a ruptured arterial vessel. His symptoms were resolved, and the hemoglobin level stabilized. At 2 months postoperatively, no surgical complications were present. Effective management of long tubular duplications with massive hemorrhage involves timely application of the Wrenn procedure. Recognition of specific imaging findings is crucial to prompt exploratory laparotomy, ensuring optimal outcomes and preventing delays in treatment."

    "abstract": "A scrotal abscess following perforated appendicitis is a rare complication. This is mostly seen in children and usually occurs due to the presence of the patent processus vaginalis, which permits the passage of pus from the intra-abdominal cavity down to the scrotum, resulting in a scrotal pyocele. There are few reported cases of such complications in young adult patients. We report a case of a 50-year-old male with a scrotal pyocele following exploratory laparotomy for perforated appendicitis. Scrotal ultrasound (US) findings were suggestive of a right-sided scrotal abscess, and the CT scan showed prominent fat in the proximal part of the right inguinal canal, which suggested the presence of a partially patent processus vaginalis. Our case is the first reported in the middle-aged group, and our review of the literature is the first directed to the adult age group. This review emphasizes the importance of considering scrotal pyocele in any patient with acute scrotum post-appendectomy, regardless of the patient's age, the affected side, and the presence or absence of identifiable patent processus vaginalis, as it may be microscopically permeable. Treatment will entail urgent drainage of the abscess, together with a course of antibiotics."

    "abstract": "Agriculture is a hazardous industry with undocumented injury events. Credible surveillance measures are critical for this industry, especially to guide injury prevention programs with targeted recommendations for specific commodity groups and populations. This multi-phase study explored the feasibility for two state agency databases, the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC) Program and the Emergency Medical Services Incident Reporting System (EMSIRS), to augment the state's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) annual reports. BWC data described injury claims in agricultural workplaces from 1999 to 2008. State EMSIRS data described the types of medical emergencies for which EMS services were requested to Ohio farms in 2013-2014. Descriptive analyses were performed on each distinctive source. Over 14,000 BWC claims were analyzed, with primary nature of injury identified as sprains and strains of bodily extremities; falls were the most common cause of injury. The EMSIRS data provided 1,376 cases, where EMS services were requested to Ohio farms at injury onset. Some cases had possibility to be excluded in CFOI or employment claims data, with 24% patients 65 years and older and 6% children 13 years and younger. The primary cause of injury was falls, and the highest reported injury type was blunt trauma. Both BWC and EMSIRS databases showed the potential to enhance Ohio's agricultural surveillance data with viable information not found in previously used systems. Each agency database had its own merits to further clarify and quantify morbidity. When used together, these sources enrich surveillance statistics to describe Ohio's agricultural injury incidents."

    "abstract": "While cardiac tamponade is a commonly recognized complication in solid organ malignancies and acute leukemias, instances of cardiac involvement in the context of chronic hematologic malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), are rarely observed. A 66-year-old male, with a history of stage IV CLL/SLL, presented with three weeks of worsening edema, orthopnea, and dyspnea. Two days after admission, an echocardiogram revealed a large circumferential pericardial effusion. Given the concern about early signs of pericardial tamponade, the patient underwent emergent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 700 cc of sanguineous fluid. A pericardial biopsy and flow cytometry of the pericardial fluid confirmed the diagnosis of CLL/SLL with pericardial involvement. There were no signs of large cell lymphoma transformation at that point. This rare case demonstrates the importance of considering cardiac complications in CLL/SLL patients who present with worsening edema, orthopnea, and dyspnea."

However, their accuracy can be affected in older adults because hemodynamic changes are less obvious. This study aimed to examine the usefulness of changes in vital signs during transportation in predicting the need for hemostatic treatments in older patients with trauma. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Japan Trauma Data Bank (2004-2019). Patients aged ≥ 65 years who were hemodynamically stable at the scene were included in this study. The incidence of emergency surgery within 12 h after hospital arrival was compared between patients with delta Shock Index (dSI) > 0.1 and those with dSI ≤ 0.1. Predicting ability was examined after adjusting for patient demographics, comorbidities, vital signs at the scene and on hospital arrival, Injury Severity Score, and abbreviated injury scale in each region. Among the 139,242 patients eligible for the study, 3,701 underwent urgent hemostatic surgery within 12 h. Patients with dSI > 0.1 showed a significantly higher incidence of emergency surgery than those with dSI ≤ 0.1 (871/16,549 [5.3%] vs. 2,830/84,250 [3.4%]; odds ratio (OR), 1.60 [1.48-1.73]; adjusted OR, 1.22 [1.08-1.38]; p = 0.001). The relationship between high dSI and a higher incidence of intervention was observed in patients with hypertension and those with decreased consciousness on arrival. High dSI > 0.1 was significantly associated with a higher incidence of urgent hemostatic surgery in older patients."

Traditionally, unscarred uteri without risk factors are considered immune to rupture and information about its risk factors is only few due to its rarity. Complementary and alternative medicine is commonly used in pregnant woman in southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, however information regarding its toxicity due to irrational use is few. This case report presents a G2P1A0 35-year-old woman with acute abdomen with spontaneous unscarred uterine rupture >15 cm after continuously consuming herbal water made of Kacip Fatimah leaves in boiling water. A 35-year-old pregnant woman was referred to hospital due to abdominal discomfort 3 hours before admission due to suspicion of intrauterine fetal death. She drank the extracted herbal water to help her when the labor comes, which was made from boiled water with rumput Fatimah from her neighbor's house. Then, she was diagnosed with G2P1A0 parturient aterm latent phase; acute abdomen due to suspicion of placentae abruption dd/ ruptur uteri; and Intrauterine Fetal Death. Exploratory laparotomy was decided due to acute abdominal pain, and during the procedure the operator decided to do subtotal hysterectomy on the patient. The operator found her uterine was already ruptured, approximately 15-18 cm and the placentae was located outside of the uterus. This case suggest that rational usage of herbal medicine must be implemented to avoid unwanted complication."

Proper diagnosis relies on specific clinical and echocardiographic findings. It is not known whether expert sonographers consistently recognize echocardiographic signs of tamponade. To assess whether expert sonographers agree on echocardiographic signs of tamponade. A 20-question survey consisting of 18 cine loops and 2 still images was distributed to the Academy of Emergency Ultrasound Section of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. Respondents answered \"yes\" or \"no\" to whether there was echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Subgroup analyses of demographics and echocardiographic views were reported. The data were analyzed using Krippendorff's alpha (α) to assess interrater reliability (IRR) between respondents. Eighty-four physicians responded and 56 completed the survey. All partial and completed surveys were analyzed. The overall IRR was poor (α = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44-0.76). Residency graduation within 5 years (α = 0.66, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) was associated with higher IRR compared with those > 5 years (α = 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.69). The highest IRR was observed when images of mitral valve inflow pulse-wave Doppler (α = 0.81, CI 0.70-0.92) were used and the poorest IRR was on images from the parasternal short view (α = 0.28, 95% CI 0.05-0.49). There was poor agreement among expert emergency medicine sonographers in identifying echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade from a single cine loop or clip without clinical context. Further investigation is warranted to understand differences in recognition of clinical tamponade."

Data were obtained from the local Society of Thoracic Surgeons' Data Warehouse and medical chart review. Compared with the classic ATAAD group, the IMH group was older (65 vs 59 years, P < .001) and more likely to be female (45% vs 32%, P = .005), with fewer comorbidities such as severe aortic insufficiency (5.0% vs 25%, P < .001), acute stroke (2.8% vs 8.3%, P = .05), acute renal failure (5.7% vs 13%, P = .04), and malperfusion syndrome (8.5% vs 26%, P < .001) but more cardiac tamponade (18% vs 11%, P = .03).

    "abstract": "Tension pneumoperitoneum is characterized by excessive accumulation of gas in the peritoneal cavity, which leads to cardiorespiratory distress. We present the case of a 4-year-old female Labrador retriever who presented with a severe abdominal distension and panting. Radiography revealed a large volume of free gas in the peritoneal cavity with decreased serosal detail. After emergency needle decompression, ultrasound-guided aspiration of the peritoneal effusion helped confirm septic peritonitis. Computed tomography revealed a gastric mass measuring approximately 3.7 × 5.0 × 5.5 cm, which was suspected to have caused the gastric perforation. A large volume of free gas was present in the peritoneal cavity, causing compression and centralization of the abdominal organs. A low-attenuating cleft suggestive of perforation site near the gastric mass was also observed. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed gastric perforation of approximately 2.2 cm adjacent to the gastric mass. The patient was finally diagnosed with tension pneumoperitoneum caused by gastric perforation. The mass was resected with a 1-2-cm surgical margin, and imprinting cytology indicated gastric carcinoma. The patient was aggressively treated with fluid, analgesic, antithrombotic, and antibacterial therapy. However, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and euthanasia was performed at the owner's request. Our report is the first to describe the multimodal imaging features of a dog with tension pneumoperitoneum secondary to gastric perforation caused by gastric neoplasm."

This study describes the non-conventional EMS response to civil unrest. The study included patients encountered by EMS in the area of the civil unrest occurring in Indianapolis, Indiana from May 29 through June 1, 2020. The area of civil unrest defined by Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department covered 15 blocks by 12 blocks (roughly 4.0 square miles) and included central Indianapolis. The study analyzed records and collected demographics, scene times, interventions, dispositions, EMS clinician narratives, transport destinations, and hospital course with outcomes from receiving hospitals for patients extracted from the area of civil unrest by EMS. Twenty-nine patients were included with ages ranging from two to sixty-eight years. In total, EMS transported 72.4% (21 of 29) of the patients, with the remainder declining transport. Ballistic injuries from gun violence accounted for 10.3% (3 of 29) of injuries. Two additional fatalities from penetrating trauma occurred among patients without EMS contact within and during the civil unrest. Conditions not involving trauma occurred in 37.9% (11 of 29). Among transported patients, 33.3% (7 of 21) were admitted to the hospital and there was one fatality. While most EMS transports did not result in hospitalization, it is important to note that the majority of EMS calls did result in a transport. There was a substantial amount of non-traumatic patient encounters. Trauma in many of the encounters was relatively severe, and the findings imply the need for rapid extraction methods from dangerous areas to facilitate timely in-hospital stabilization."

We present a case of a 25-year-old para 2 + 1, black African woman, who was referred from a peripheral Health Centre level IV in the Northern part of Uganda to a Regional Referral Hospital due to an abnormal presentation with easily palpable fetal parts. This case emphasizes the significance of prompt diagnosis, interdisciplinary collaboration, surgical planning, and managing the placenta in advanced intra-abdominal pregnancies. A 25 year African black female, para 2 + 1 upon arrival at Regional Referral Hospital, a University Teaching Hospital during a weekend, an ultrasound was sourced from a nearby private clinic revealing an extra-uterine intra-abdominal pregnancy at 38 weeks of gestation and she was promptly sent back to the University Teaching Hospital. Following this diagnosis, the patient, who hailed from a remote village over 30 km away, returned to her family for discussions. After three days, she was readmitted. Emergency laparotomy unveiled an omental gestation sac with extensive placental attachment. A live female infant was delivered successfully, placenta was left in situ. The postoperative course was uneventful, with initial concerns about inadequate breast milk flow which resolved after placental removal during the second exploratory laparotomy. This case highlights the uncommon occurrence of an advanced intra-abdominal pregnancies and emphasizes the importance of multi-disciplinary teamwork and placental management. The favorable outcome in the management was based on thorough assessment of the placental location, attachments and blood supply during surgery. It demonstrates the possibility of reduced risk of massive bleeding if there is a delayed removal of placenta with favorable attachment. This is particularly important for milk letdown as well as reducing the needs of blood transfusion in resource limited settings."

Abdominal computed tomography revealed a large left retroperitoneal hematoma. Recurrent hypovolemic shock occurred despite the transcatheter arterial embolization of the left renal artery. Repetitive abdominal computed tomography results showed active hemorrhage. Result: An exploratory laparotomy was used to confirm descending colonic mesenteric artery bleeding, which was resolved. The patient needed temporary regular kidney replacement therapy for active lupus nephritis, which terminated one month after discharge. Conclusions: When patients with SLE experience acute abdominal pain, flank pain, or back pain combined with hypovolemia, there is a higher risk of bleeding due to spontaneous hemorrhage, which should be included in the differential diagnosis.

The aim of the study was to determine the association between intraoperative risk factors and newly developed postoperative NCs in patients after emergency surgery for ATAAD. Materials and Methods: A total of 203 patients requiring emergency surgery were included in the study. Patients with preoperative neurological dysfunction, deceased on the operating table or within the first 48 h after intensive care admission, with uncertain postoperative neurologic status or with incomplete records were excluded. Results: Mean age was 57.61 ± 12.27 years. Hyperlipidemia was the most frequent comorbidity (69%). A bicuspid aortic valve was present in 12.8% of cases, severe acute aortic regurgitation was present in 29.1% of patients, and cardiac tamponade was present in 27.1% of cases. The innominate artery was the most frequently dissected supra-aortic artery in 27.1% of cases. In 65% of cases, the primary entry tear was at the level of the ascending aorta. The incidence of newly developed postoperative NCs was 39.4%. The most common surgical technique performed was supra-coronary ascending aorta and hemiarch replacement, in 53.2% of patients. Using logistic regression, cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR = 1.01; 95% CI = 1.01-1.02; p < 0.001), aortic cross-clamp time over 3 h (OR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.43-5.14, p = 0.002) and cerebral perfusion time (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.002-1.03; p = 0.027) were independently associated with newly developed postoperative NCs. Conclusions: Based on the results of the study, all efforts should be made to reduce operative times. Using a simple surgical technique, like the supra-coronary ascending aorta and hemiarch technique, whenever possible, and using a simpler technique for cerebral perfusion like unilateral cerebral perfusion via the right axillary artery, could reduce operating times."

Of the various complications associated with scrub typhus, splenic rupture has rarely been reported, and its mechanisms are unknown. This study reports a case of scrub typhus-related spontaneous splenic rupture and identifies possible mechanisms through the gross and histopathologic findings. A 78-year-old man presented to our emergency room with a 5-day history of fever and skin rash. On physical examination, eschar was observed on the left upper abdominal quadrant. The abdomen was not tender, and there was no history of trauma. The Orientia tsutsugamushi antibody titer using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test was 1:640. On Day 6 of hospitalization, he complained of sudden-onset left upper abdominal quadrant pain and showed mental changes. His vital signs were a blood pressure of 70/40 mmHg, a heart rate pf 140 beats per min, and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per min, with a temperature of 36.8 °C. There were no signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. Grey Turner's sign was suspected during an abdominal examination. Portable ultrasonography showed retroperitoneal bleeding, so an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, leading to a diagnosis of hemoperitoneum due to splenic rupture and a splenectomy. The patient had been taking oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for 6 days; after surgery, this was discontinued, and intravenous azithromycin (500 mg daily) was administered. No arrhythmia associated with azithromycin was observed. However, renal failure with hemodialysis, persistent hyperbilirubinemia, and multiorgan failure occurred. The patient did not recover and died on the fifty-sixth day of hospitalization. Clinicians should consider the possibility of splenic rupture in patients with scrub typhus who display sudden-onset abdominal pain and unstable vital signs. In addition, splenic capsular rupture and extra-capsular hemorrhage are thought to be caused by splenomegaly and capsular distention resulting from red blood cell congestion in the red pulp destroying the splenic sinus."

    "abstract": "Intussusception refers to the invagination of a proximal loop of the bowel into an adjacent distal segment. This condition is rare in adults, especially when it involves a complete folding of the ileocecal area out of the body cavity. Meanwhile, enterogenous cysts are congenital malformations that are largely identified in childhood following symptoms of bowel obstruction. While surgical treatment is ultimately required for both diseases, deciding on the type of surgery and the right time to operate can be a challenge for clinicians. It is especially difficult to decide on treatment for an adult with the coincidental occurrence of both conditions and no definitive pathologic diagnosis prior to surgery. Here, we present the case study of a 19-year-old female patient who presented with a prolapsed anus due to intussusception caused by a large ileocecal mass. The patient was admitted to the emergency department with a \"massive anal mass.\" She remained symptomatic after receiving conventional conservative treatment and had to undergo emergency surgery after developing an intestinal obstruction. While the patient's intraoperative condition also confirmed the preoperative CT findings, the situation became more complicated during surgery. The postoperative pathological report indicated the presence of an enterogenous cyst. After recovery from surgery, the patient was successfully discharged. Intussusception or intestinal obstruction caused by an intestinal mass is a surgical indication, and removal is the only way to cure the condition. This case study provides a helpful reference for general surgeons, especially anorectal surgeons, imaging physicians, and pathologists, and informs the diagnosis and treatment of this patient population."

An exploratory laparotomy can be performed to definitively diagnose and treat the defect. A 36-year-old female, with no known comorbids and no significant past medical and surgical history presented with acute abdominal pain, multiple episodes of vomiting, and absolute constipation. After clinical and radiologic investigations, the diagnosis of an internal herniation of small bowel to the broad ligament was suspected. An emergent exploratory laparotomy was then performed. Intra-operatively it was found that she had a bilateral defect to the broad ligament and a unilateral broad ligament hernia (BLH). Postoperatively she remained vitally stable and was discharged home. We report a rare case of a unilateral broad ligament hernia with a bilateral defect. Diagnosis of BLH is associated with diagnostic uncertainty mainly due to its rarity and nonspecific presentation. Although broad ligament herniation is rare, it is a significant cause of intestinal obstruction and may result in complications if not attended to timely. Early diagnosis and management is necessary to minimize associated morbidity and mortality that can occur as a consequence of bowel ischemia and necrosis."

A trauma database was queried for all patients with a diagnosis of TCS at a single level 1 urban trauma center between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2021. Demographic and injury variables collected included age, sex, BMI, mechanism of injury, and creatine phosphokinase levels (CPK). Hospital quality measures including time from admission to surgery, length of both hospital and ICU stay, complications, and cost of care were collected. Descriptive statistics are reported as median [interquartile range] or N (percent). There were 14 patients identified with a diagnosis of TCS. All were men with an average age 33.5 [23.5 - 38] years and an average BMI of 26 [22.9-28.1]. The most common cause of injury was blunt trauma (71.4 %), and the remaining 28.6 % were gunshot wound injuries. Within the cohort, 6 (42.9 %) patients sustained a femoral shaft fracture, and 4 (28.6 %) patients sustained a vascular injury. The median initial CPK of patients within this cohort was 3405 [1232-5339] and reached a peak of 5271 [3013-13,266]. The median time from admission to diagnosis was 6.8 [0-236.9] hours. The median time from admission to the operating room was 8.2 [0.6-236.9] hours, and the median number of operating room visits was 3 [2 - 6]. Five patients (35.7 %) wounds were closed with split thickness skin grafting. There were 12 (85.7 %) patients who required ICU care. The median ICU length of stay was 7.5 days [4-15]. The median hospital length of stay was 16.5 days [13.25-38.0]. The median total charges for a patient with thigh compartment syndrome was $129,159.00 [$24,768.00 - $587,152.00]. The median direct variable cost for these patients was $86,106.00 For comparison, the median direct variable cost for patients with femur fractures without TCS at this institution was $8,497.28 [$1,903.52-$21,893.13]. No patients required readmission within 60 days. There were no mortalities. TCS is a rare and life-threatening injury associated with significant morbidity. Despite rapid diagnosis and fasciotomy, the majority of the patients have prolonged hospital courses, ICU lengths of stay, and significant costs of treatment. Providers can reference the outcomes reported in this study when caring for TCS patients."

    "abstract": "To present our experience of multidisciplinary management of high-grade pediatric liver injuries. Pediatric high-grade liver injuries pose significant challenge to management due to associated morbidity and mortality. Emergency surgical intervention to control hemorrhage and biliary leak in these patients is usually suboptimal. Conservative management in selected high-grade liver injuries is now becoming standard of care. Management of hemobilia due to pseudoaneurysm formation and traumatic bile leaks requires multidisciplinary management. A retrospective review was undertaken for patients presenting with blunt liver injuries at two tertiary care centers in Karachi, Pakistan, from March 2021 to December 2022. Twenty-eight patients were identified, and four patients fulfilled the criteria for grade 4 and above blunt liver injury during this period. One case with grade 4 liver injury developed hemobilia on 7th day of injury. He required two settings of angioembolization but had recurrent leak from pseudoaneurysm. He ultimately needed right hepatic artery ligation. Second patient presented with massive biliary peritonitis 2 days following injury. He was managed initially with tube laparostomy followed by ERCP and stent placement. The third patient developed large hemoperitoneum managed conservatively. One case with grade 5 injury expired during emergency surgery. Conservative management of advanced liver injuries can result in significant morbidity and mortality due to high risk of complications. Trauma surgeons need to have multidisciplinary team for management of these patients to gain optimal outcome."

    "abstract": "Background There have so far been no reports regarding whether or not the jugular veins remain distended even in cases of cardiac arrest, which is the worst form of shock. We focused on the diameter of the jugular vein in neck computed tomography (CT) in cases of thoracic aortic disease resulting in cardiac arrest to determine whether or not cardiac tamponade increased the diameter. Methodology From January 2014 to December 2021, patients were eligible for inclusion when they were transported to our hospital, judged to be in cardiac arrest at the emergency department, and then diagnosed with thoracic aortic disease as the cause of cardiac arrest according to CT. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (tamponade (+)) or absence (tamponade (-)) of cardiac tamponade. Comparisons between the two groups were also conducted after excluding cases in which relief of cardiac tamponade was obtained before CT or that had hemothorax. Results There were 52 cases in the cardiac tamponade (+) group and 16 in the cardiac tamponade (-) group. The diameters of both the right and left internal jugular veins were significantly larger in the cardiac tamponade (+) group than in the cardiac tamponade (-) group. After excluding cases with relief of cardiac tamponade before CT and hemothorax complications, the right and left internal and external jugular vein diameters in the cardiac tamponade (+) group were still significantly greater than those in the cardiac tamponade (-) group. Conclusions The present study showed that the cardiac tamponade induced by thoracic aortic cases tended to display larger internal jugular vein diameters compared to cases without cardiac tamponade, even in patients experiencing cardiac arrest. Additionally, cardiac tamponade consistently presented with larger diameters in the right-sided jugular vein."

    "abstract": "Hybrid emergency room systems, namely hybrid ER (HER), enable us to perform computed tomography (CT), surgery, and interventional radiology (IVR) without patient transfer. HER significantly shortened the time to CT after arrival and allowed us to achieve early intervention, resulting in reduced mortality from exsanguination in patients with severe blunt trauma. We encountered a patient diagnosed with left common iliac artery occlusion and dissection caused by blunt traumatic compressive abdominal injury with transection of the small intestine, kidney, and adrenal and pelvic ring fractures. Although the patient experienced cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) immediately after CT, we performed damage control surgery (DCS) and IVR after temporary aortic occlusion in the HER and resuscitated the patient. The present case, in which rapid diagnosis and intervention were performed and the patient was successfully resuscitated, supports the efficacy of the HER system for managing severe blunt trauma."

    "abstract": "Postoperative internal hernias after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) have an incidence of 2%-9% and are a surgical emergency. Evidence on factors associated with length of stay (LOS) after emergent internal hernia reduction in RYGB patients is limited. This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent internal hernia reduction after RYGB at our tertiary care center over a 5 year period from 2015 to 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and intra- and postoperative hospital course were collected. Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were used to investigate factors associated with LOS. We identified 38 patients with internal hernia after RYGB. These patients with mean age 44.1 years were majority female (71.1%) and white race (60.5%). Of the 24 patients where the RYGB was done at our institution, the mean RYGB to IH interval was 43 months. Petersen's defect (57.8%) followed by jejuno-jejunal mesenteric defect (31.6%) were the most common locations for IH. Both Petersen's and jejuno-jejunal mesenteric hernias were found in 4 cases (10.5%). Revision of bypass and small bowel resection were required in 13.2% and 5.3% of cases, respectively. The median (interquartile range) length of stay (LOS) was 2 days. On the multivariate analysis, male sex (P = .019), conversion to exploratory laparotomy (P = .005), and resection of small bowel (P < .001) were independent risk factors for increased LOS. The most common location of IH after RYGB is Petersen's defect, followed by jejuno-jejunal mesenteric defect. LOS was significantly associated with male sex, exploratory laparotomy, and resection of small bowel."

    "abstract": "We aimed to reveal the protective effect of body mass index (BMI) and subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (SATT), together with scores covering the abdomen, in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma. The data of 234 abdominal penetrating trauma patients over the age of 16 who applied to the emergency general sur-gery unit of Istanbul Medipol Hospital between 2017 and 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Sex, age, types of penetrating injuries, BMI, need for blood transfusion and intensive care unit (ICU), mortality, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index (PATI), and Flint Colon Injury Score (FCIS) were recorded. The patients were divided into two groups: Gunshot Wound (GW) and Stab Wound (SW).While there was no significant difference in all parameters examined in all patients and GW patients in terms of BMI, a statistically significant difference was found in terms of blood transfusion need in SW patients (p=0.035). As a result of the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis for the SATT variable, the cutoff value between mortality (p=0.866) and SATT (mm) values in all patients was 11 mm for all patients and 12 mm for GW patients. A significant difference was found in all patients and separately in GW and SW groups in terms of ICU and blood transfusion need, length of stay, ISS, PATI, and FCIS scores in non-operated patients (p<0.05). When all patients were examined, a statistically significant difference was found in terms of mortality (p=0.002). It is the first study to evaluate penetrating abdominal injuries with both BMI and SATT comprehensively and with all abdominal scores. A cutoff value to be determined for SATT with larger and multicenter studies can take its place as a parameter in the penetrating trauma algorithm."

    "abstract": "Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) adds to India's significant economic burden, with pericardial effusion being a potentially fatal complication. This case report highlights the need for early diagnosis and the feasibility of shorter-duration treatment for EPTB in developing countries. This case report describes a 19-year-old male from Southeast Asia who had a history of bronchiectasis involving the left lower lobe and the right middle lobe, which was cystic in nature, as well as multiple episodes of non-tuberculous pneumonia. Currently, he presented with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and acute kidney injury. Echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and moderate pericardial effusion. Early signs of cardiac tamponade were noted, specifically the absence of respiratory variation in the right ventricle and left ventricle collapse. Emergent pericardiocentesis was performed, and hemorrhagic pericardial fluid was aspirated. Fluid analysis revealed high levels of LDH (5000 U/L), polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, and acid-fast bacilli that were visualized on microscopy, which led to the diagnosis of pericardial tuberculosis. A CT of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and polyserositis. Empirically, antitubercular therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was administered for 2 months and isoniazid along with rifampicin was given for the next 4 months. Serial echocardiograms in the following months showed an improvement in LVEF (55%) and decreased effusion. However, during this treatment period, due to frequent episodes of pneumonia, the evaluation of immunodeficiency disorders was performed and revealed low levels of IgG (4.741 g/L), IgA (0.238 g/L), and IgM (0.098 g/L). He was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency disease and received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. This report emphasizes the timely identification of cardiac tamponade and the effective management of EPTB through a shorter-than-recommended course of antitubercular therapy, resulting in the alleviation of symptoms and better overall health outcomes."

    "abstract": "Traumatic pneumopericardium (PPC) is a rare clinical entity associated with chest trauma, resulting from a pleuropericardial connection in the presence of a pneumothorax, interstitial air tracking along the pulmonary perivascular sheaths from ruptured alveoli to the pericardium, or direct trachea-bronchial-pericardial communication.  Our objectives were to describe the modern management approach to PPC and to identify variables that could improve survival with severe thoracic injury. We conducted a retrospective study of the trauma registry between 2015 and 2022 at a Level I verified adult trauma center for all patients with PPC. Demographics, injury patterns, and treatment characteristics were compared between blunt and penetrating trauma. This study focused on the management strategies and the physiologic status regarding PPC and the development of tension physiology. The main outcome measure was operative versus nonoperative management. Over a seven-year period, there were 46,389 trauma admissions, of which 488 patients had pneumomediastinum. Eighteen patients were identified with PPC at admission. Median age was 39.5 years (range, 18-77 years), predominantly male (n = 16, 89 %), Black (n = 12, 67 %), and the majority from blunt trauma (78 %). Half had subcutaneous emphysema on presentation while 39 % had recognizable pneumomediastinum on chest x-ray. Tube thoracostomy was the most common intervention in this cohort (89 %). Despite tube thoracostomy, tension PPC was observed in three patients, two mandating emergent pericardial windows for progression to tension physiology, and the remaining requiring reconstruction of a blunt tracheal disruption. The majority of PPC patients recovered with expectant management (83 %), and no deaths were directly related to PPC. Traumatic PPC is a rare radiographic finding with the majority successfully managed conservatively in a monitored ICU setting. These patients often have severe thoracic injury with concomitant injuries requiring thoracostomy alone; however, emergent surgical intervention may be required when PPC progresses to tension physiology to improve overall survival."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal tract perforation (GITP) due to metastatic lung cancer is an exceptionally rare occurrence. Symptoms can range from mild abdominal discomfort to severe and life-threatening bowel perforation. In this case presentation, we describe an unusual instance involving squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where microscopic metastases in the small bowel led to bowel perforation. Our patient, a 71-year-old male with a history of stage IIIa squamous cell carcinoma in the right lung and smoking history, completed chemoradiation therapy and is currently undergoing treatment with durvalumab. He presented to the ED with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and abdominal distention. His review of systems revealed no other significant issues, and his vital signs were stable. However, the abdominal examination revealed noticeable distention with tenderness upon palpation and guarding. Laboratory results were significant for leukocytosis with a left shift of neutrophils and mildly elevated kidney function. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed widespread pneumoperitoneum, indicating a bowel perforation. Consequently, the patient underwent an urgent exploratory laparotomy, during which a small bowel perforation measuring 0.6 cm x 0.3 cm in the jejunum was identified, necessitating the resection of the affected bowel segment. Intraoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed normal findings. The histopathological examination of the resected bowel revealed clusters of squamous cell carcinoma with a desmoplastic reaction, affecting the submucosal and muscular layers at the site of the defect, with surgical margins free of tumor or inflammation. This finding indicated metastatic disease originating from the known lung squamous cell carcinoma. After the operation, the patient was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by E. coli and Klebsiella peritonitis, requiring intubation and circulatory support with pressors. Ultimately, he was discharged following treatment. This case underscores the rarity of symptomatic bowel perforation from micro-metastasis in squamous NSCLC and emphasizes the need for rigorous assessment and timely surgical intervention. However, it is important to recognize the significant risk of complications and a high mortality rate, leading to a challenging prognosis. As such, individuals with a known history of lung carcinoma who present with abdominal symptoms should undergo comprehensive evaluation to prevent life-threatening complications through early intervention."

    "abstract": "Training in acute care, such as emergency medicine (EM), where exposure to critically ill and injured patients is high, impacts the well-being of trainees and contributes to burnout. Investigating how, and if, trainees prepare for these situations is necessary to ensure they are supported. This study aimed to evaluate medical students' perspectives and emotional preparedness for handling acute care and trauma. We conducted a pilot investigation using a remote digital survey of medical students during their EM clerkship at a large, urban academic institution. The primary outcome of interest was student-reported preparedness and comfort in handling trauma and critical care patient encounters. Secondary outcomes included awareness of well-being resources and comfort in accessing digital well-being resources. A total of 57 medical students completed the voluntary digital survey, and half of the students (n=28, 49%) reported having witnessed the care of a critically ill or a penetrating trauma patient (eg, a victim of gun violence). A majority (n=40, 70%) had thought about how these events may impact them, and over half felt unprepared to identify the emotional impact these cases may have on them (n=31, 54%) or address the emotional or mental health impact (n=36, 63%). Less than a quarter (n=14, 25%) were aware of digital mental health resources, and 58% (n=33) did not feel fully comfortable connecting with resources if needed. Students who had previously witnessed critical care were significantly more likely to report feeling well prepared in identifying the emotional impact and addressing this impact. In this cross-sectional survey, students did not feel fully prepared to identify or address the emotional impact of working in EM. Additionally, they lacked awareness of or comfort with accessing digital institutional resources meant to support their well-being, such as a large web-based platform. These findings can help inform and guide interventions by educational and academic leaders. The aim would be to create and promote environments that empower students with tools to identify their own emotions and connect to well-being resources."

    "abstract": "At the 2023 ATLS symposium, the priority of circulation was emphasized through the \"x-airway-breathing-circulation (ABC)\" sequence, where \"x\" stands for exsanguinating hemorrhage control. With growing evidence from military and civilian studies supporting an x-ABC approach to trauma care, a prehospital advanced resuscitative care (ARC) bundle emphasizing early transfusion was developed in our emergency medical services (EMS) system. We hypothesized that prioritization of prehospital x-ABC through ARC would reduce in-hospital mortality. This was a single-year prospective analysis of patients with severe hemorrhage. These patients were combined with our institution's historic controls before prehospital blood implementation. Included were patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90 mmHg. Excluded were patients with penetrating head trauma or prehospital cardiac arrest. Two-to-one propensity matching for x-ABC to ABC groups was conducted, and the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality, was compared between groups. A total of 93 patients (x-ABC = 62, ABC = 31) met the inclusion criteria. There was no difference in patient age, sex, initial SBP, initial Glasgow Coma Score, and initial shock index between groups. When compared with the ABC group, x-ABC patients had significant improvement in vitals at emergency department admission. Overall mortality was lower in the x-ABC group (13% vs 47%, p < 0.001). Multivariable regression revealed that prehospital circulation-first prioritization was independently associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.54, p = 0.004). This is the first analysis to demonstrate a prehospital survival benefit of x-ABC in this subset of patient with severe injury and hemorrhagic shock. Standardization of prehospital x-ABC management in this patient population warrants special consideration."

    "abstract": "Limited data exist on pre-hospital pediatric trauma mortality in Canada. The Nova Scotia Trauma Registry is a provincial population-based registry that captures data from the Medical Examiner Service. This study examined the characteristics of pediatric trauma patient mortality in the pre-hospital and in-hospital settings. We conducted a cohort study of major pediatric traumas recorded in our provincial database from April 1, 2001 to March 31, 2018. Characteristics of pre-hospital and in-hospital deaths were compared with t tests and Chi-square analyses. Multivariate regression modeling was used to identify predictors of pre-hospital mortality. The geographic distribution of pre-hospital trauma was assessed using choropleth maps. We identified 1,258 pediatric traumas, resulting in 217 deaths (137 pre-hospital, 80 in-hospital). Males accounted for 62.7% of fatalities. The 15-17 age group accounted for most deaths in both groups (pre-hospital 61.3%; in-hospital 41.3%). Injuries sustained in rural areas resulted in 74.7% of all deaths. For both groups, blunt trauma was the predominant injury type and motor vehicle collisions, the most prevalent injury mechanism. Patients who died pre-hospital had a higher mean age (13.3 vs. 10.7, p = 0.002) and a greater proportion were intentional injuries (23.4% vs. 15%; p = 0.02). Urban residency was more frequently observed in in-hospital deaths (57.5% vs. 36.5%, p < 0.001). Pre-hospital mortality was associated with increasing age (OR 1.1), higher injury severity score (OR 1.1), and intentional injury (OR 15.6). Over 10% of major pediatric traumas resulted in pre-hospital death, primarily from motor vehicle collisions in rural areas. Compared to in-hospital mortality, patients who died pre-hospital were older with more severe injuries and more likely to have intentionally injured themselves. These results underscore the importance for emergency physicians and EMS systems to consider geographic factors and injury patterns, advocate for improved injury prevention programs, mental health supports, and delivery of on-scene critical care services. RéSUMé: OBJECTIFS: Il existe peu de données sur la mortalité liée aux traumatismes pédiatriques pré-hospitaliers au Canada. La Nouvelle-Écosse. Le registre des traumatismes est un registre provincial fondé sur la population qui saisit les données du Medical Examiner Service. Cette étude a examiné les caractéristiques des traumatismes pédiatriques la mortalité des patients en milieu pré-hospitalier et hospitalier. MéTHODES: Nous avons mené une étude de cohorte des traumatismes pédiatriques majeurs enregistrés dans notre province base de données du 1er avril 2001 au 31 mars 2018. Caractéristiques des services pré-hospitaliers et les décès hospitaliers ont été comparés aux tests-t et aux analyses du chi carré. La modélisation multivariée de régression a été utilisée pour identifier les prédicteurs de la mortalité pré-hospitalière. La répartition géographique des traumatismes pré-hospitaliers a été évaluée à l’aide de cartes choroplèthes. RéSULTATS: Nous avons identifié 1258 traumatismes pédiatriques, entraînant 217 décès (137 pré-hospitaliers, 80 hospitalier les hommes représentaient 62,7% des décès. Le groupe des 15 à 17 ans représentait la plupart des décès dans les deux groupes (avant l’hôpital 61,3%; à l’hôpital 41,3%). Blessures subies dans les régions rurales ont entraîné 74,7% de tous les décès. Pour les deux groupes, le traumatisme contondant était le type de blessure prédominant et les collisions de véhicules à moteur, les blessures les plus fréquentes. Les patients décédés avant l’hospitalisation avaient un âge moyen plus élevé (13,3 vs 10,7, p = 0,002) et une plus grande proportion étaient des blessures intentionnelles (23,4% contre 15%; p = 0,02). La résidence en milieu urbain était plus fréquemment observée dans les décès à l’hôpital (57,5% contre 36,5%, p < 0.001). La mortalité pré-hospitalière était associée à une augmentation de l’âge (CP 1.1) le score de gravité des blessures (CP 1.1) et les blessures intentionnelles (CP 15.6). CONCLUSIONS: Plus de 10% des traumatismes pédiatriques majeurs ont entraîné un décès avant l’hôpital, principalement à cause de troubles moteurs les collisions de véhicules dans les régions rurales. Comparativement à la mortalité à l’hôpital, les patients qui sont décédés avant. les établissements de soins palliatifs étaient plus âgés et plus susceptibles d’avoir intentionnellement subi des blessures plus graves. Ces résultats soulignent l’importance pour les médecins d’urgence et les systèmes de SMU pour tenir compte des facteurs géographiques et des tendances en matière de blessures, préconiser amélioration des programmes de prévention des blessures, du soutien en santé mentale et de la prestation sur place services de soins intensifs."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the characteristics associated with the need for urinary intervention for a blunt renal injury with collection system involvement using a computed tomography (CT) protocol for trauma. Abdominal CT images of patients with blunt renal injuries from 2016 to 2020 were reviewed. Patients with low-grade renal trauma, non-collecting system involvement, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade V shattered kidney, and emergent nephrectomy were excluded. The largest perinephric mass thickness was measured in the axial view using CT, and a cutoff value was obtained using a receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. Risk factors for further urinary intervention were analyzed. Among the 70 patients included in this study, those with perinephric mass thicknesses < 25 mm (n = 36) had a significantly lower rate of urinary intervention than those with perinephric mass thicknesses ≥ 25 mm (0 vs. 5; p = 0.023). There was no significant difference in the follow-up durations of the groups (19 days vs. 38 days; p = 0.198). More than 90% of the perinephric mass in the < 25 mm group resolved within a median follow-up duration of 38 days, whereas nearly half of the ≥ 25 mm group had a residual perinephric mass during a median follow-up duration of 19 days. The initial CT protocol for trauma was useful for predicting the need for further urinary interventions for collecting system injuries. A perinephric mass thickness < 25 mm is predictive of a low likelihood of requiring urinary intervention."

    "abstract": "Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is a major contributor to mortality and morbidity in all age groups and poses a significant burden on the healthcare system. Although there have been advances in treatment modalities, survival rates for TCA patients remain low. This narrative literature review critically examines the indications and effectiveness of current therapeutic approaches in treating TCA. We performed a literature search in the PubMed and Scopus databases for studies published before December 31, 2022. The search was refined by combining search terms, examining relevant study references, and restricting publications to the English language. Following the search, 943 articles were retrieved, and two independent reviewers conducted a screening process. A review of various studies on pre- and intra-arrest prognostic factors showed that survival rates were higher when patients had an initial shockable rhythm. There were conflicting results regarding other prognostic factors, such as witnessed arrest, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the use of prehospital or in-hospital epinephrine. Emergency thoracotomy was found to result in more favorable outcomes in cases of penetrating trauma than in those with blunt trauma. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) provides an advantage to emergency thoracotomy in terms of occupational safety for the operator as an alternative in managing hemorrhagic shock. When implemented in the setting of aortic occlusion, emergency thoracotomy and REBOA resulted in comparable mortality rates. Veno-venous extracorporeal life support (V-V ECLS) and veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (V-A ECLS) are viable options for treating respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock, respectively. In the context of traumatic injuries, V-V ECLS has been associated with higher rates of survival to discharge than V-A ECLS. TCA remains a significant challenge for emergency medical services due to its high morbidity and mortality rates. Pre- and intra-arrest prognostic factors can help identify patients who are likely to benefit from aggressive and resource-intensive resuscitation measures. Further research is needed to enhance guidelines for the clinical use of established and emerging therapeutic approaches that can help optimize treatment efficacy and ameliorate survival outcomes."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is also associated with thrombosis. We present the case of a 69-year-old man with essential thrombocythemia complicated by COVID-19 who developed a left ventricular thrombus. We performed thrombectomy, but the patient developed recurrent left ventricular thrombus 8 days after surgery. Emergency redo thrombectomy was performed followed by aggressive blood-thinning therapy. The postoperative course was complicated by cardiac tamponade requiring surgical drainage 8 days after the second surgery. The patient was discharged home 25 days after the second operation without any complications. Left ventricular thrombus is a rare but fatal complication associated with essential thrombocythemia. COVID-19 has also been reported to cause coagulopathy. This case suggested that after surgery for left ventricular thrombus complicated by multiple risk factors including essential thrombocythemia and COVID-19, aggressive blood-thinning therapy with combination of anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and metabolic antagonist may help prevent recurrent thrombosis."

While arthritis, pleuritis, peritonitis, and pericarditis are common in FMF, large pericardial effusions with cardiac tamponade as a sequelae of FMF are considered rare.  We report a case of an 83-year-old female with a history of FMF who presented with chest pain. She was found to have acute pericarditis complicated by hemodynamically significant pericardial tamponade that was subsequently treated with an urgent pericardiocentesis followed by colchicine."

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcer disease (PPUD) has a prevalence of 0.004-0.014% with mortality of 23.5% (Tarasconi et al. in World J Emerg Surg 15(PG-3):3, 2020). In this single center study, we examined the impact associated with patient transfer from outside facilities to our center for definitive surgical intervention (exploratory laparotomy). Using EPIC report workbench, we identified 27 patients between 2018 and 2021 undergoing exploratory laparotomy with a concurrent diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease, nine of which were transferred to our institution for care. We queried this population for markers of disease severity including mortality, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and readmission rates. Manual chart reviews were performed to examine these outcomes in more detail and identify patients who had been transferred to our facility for surgery from an outside hospital. A total of 27 patients were identified undergoing exploratory laparotomy for definitive treatment of PPUD. The majority of patients queried underwent level A operations, the most urgent level of activation. In our institution, a Level A operation needs to go to the operating room within one hour of arrival to the hospital. Average mortality for this patient population was 14.8%. The readmission rate was 40.1%, and average length of ICU stay post-operatively was 16 days, with 83% of non-transfer patients requiring ICU admission and 100% of transfer patients requiring ICU admission, although this was not found to be statistically significant. Average length of hospital stay was 27 days overall. For non-transfer patients and transfer patients, LOS was 20 days and 41 days, respectively, which was statistically significant by one-sided t-test (p = 0.05). Patients transferred for definitive care of PPUD in a population otherwise notable for high mortality and high readmission rates: their average length of stay compared to non-transfer patients was over twice the length, which was statistically significant. Transferred patients also had higher rates of ICU care requirement although this was not statistically significant. Further inquiry to identify modifiable variables to facilitate the care of transferred patients is warranted, especially in the context of improving quality metrics known to enhance patient outcomes, satisfaction, and value."

    "title": "Cardiac tamponade associated with primary myelofibrosis: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an abnormal amount of fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac and impedes the cardiac filling process. Although extremely rare, haematological diseases have the potential to trigger an extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) process within the pericardium, resulting in a substantial build-up of pericardial effusion. We present the case of a 29-year-old male previously diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), who presented to the emergency unit with cardiac tamponade. An emergent pericardiocentesis procedure was performed, successfully evacuating 850 mL of haemorrhagic fluid. Over the course of 3 days, a total of 1.5 L of haemorrhagic effusion were drained from the pericardial space. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed evidence of haematopoietic activity, suggesting a potential association with the EMH process occurring within the pericardium. Following a 7-day hospitalization, the patient was discharged in stable condition but later experienced the development of constrictive pericarditis. Haemorrhagic pericardial effusion is a rare occurrence. The majority of cases stems from complications of medical procedures (iatrogenic), malignancies, or side effects of antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications. In patients with PMF, the impaired haematopoietic ability caused by the fibrotic process in the bone marrow compels the body to produce blood components elsewhere, a phenomenon known as EMH. On very rare occasions, EMH can develop in the pericardial space, potentially leading to life-threatening cardiac tamponade. Our patient was successfully managed through pericardial fluid evacuation and drainage but later developed constrictive pericarditis."

    "abstract": "Hypereosinophilia is unusual in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but can occur in severe long-lasting disease, especially in patients with extra-articular manifestations and high titers of rheumatoid factor (RF). The association of RA and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) remains yet poorly known. We present a case of a 46 years old woman with long-standing untreated RA, that presented to emergency department with severe symptoms of constrictive pericarditis with cardiac tamponade and bilateral pleural effusion, that progressed to cardiac arrest, associated to symmetrical polyarthritis and pruritic erythematous skin papules. She was submitted to urgent pericardial drainage and partial pericardiotomy. Laboratory analyses revealed hypereosinophilia, and elevated inflammatory parameters and immunoglobulin E. The histological study of the pericardium showed results consistent with inflammatory fibrinous pericarditis. Taking into account the presence of some characteristics that are usually present in cases of reactive HES instead of idiopathic HES, and after an intensive diagnostic study, that could rule out other potential causes of secondary HES, the diagnosis of HES associated with RA was made. She started glucocorticoids during hospitalization and methotrexate 15mg per week at the first outpatient rheumatology visit. After 12 weeks of treatment, we considered that she was in clinical and analytical remission, consistently maintaining that after a complete tapering of glucocorticoids. This case illustrates that clinicians should be aware that HES (including severe life-threatening cases) can occur in patients with RA, especially in cases of long-lasting disease with high titters of RF and without treatment, even in the absence of extra-articular features."

Additionally, a comprehensive review of relevant literature is provided. A 66-year-old female patient, diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thrombocytopenia, underwent ESD to address a laterally spreading tumor located in the ascending colon. After the procedure, the patient manifested abdominal pain and a high fever, was diagnosed with peritonitis, necessitating an emergency exploratory laparotomy and right hemicolectomy. Subsequent histological examination indicated a significant presence of neutrophil infiltration across all layers of the intestines. The ascites culture yielded the growth of Escherichia coli. A search was conducted in the PubMed database to identify case reports conforming to the definition of phlegmonous enteritis proposed by Rokitansky et al. We retrieved about 30 studies regarding phlegmonous enteritis from 1951 to 2022, with around 39 cases. Among these, only 28 patients had comprehensive medical data available. Subsequently, an examination of the literature was undertaken to explore the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of phlegmonous enteritis. The possibility of phlegmonous enteritis should be taken into consideration in cases of unexplained acute abdomen, particularly in patients with compromised immunity, in order to provide active surgical and antibiotic interventions."

    "abstract": "Colonic intramural hematomas are rarely encountered clinically. They are most commonly caused by blunt trauma to the abdomen. Diagnosis is usually reached by a combination of a detailed history, physical examination, and radiological investigations. A 14-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain with a history of a go-karting accident. Upon physical examination, the patient was tachycardic and hypertensive, with right-side abdominal tenderness and fullness. After going through routine radiological investigations, a computed tomography scan showed a large intramural hematoma of the ascending colon measuring around 7.7 x 8.4 x 2 cm. The patient was admitted for conservative management. Throughout her admission, serial examinations were performed, which showed improvement in the patient's condition and the size of the hematoma. The patient was discharged in a stable condition after showing good recovery. Following up with the patient a month later, she was in good condition with no active complaints, and an ultrasound was done that revealed complete resolution. To our understanding, this report of colonic intramural hematoma caused by the unusual etiology of the go-karting accident, which was successfully managed conservatively, adds significantly to the literature."

    "abstract": "A 4.6-year-old spayed female German shepherd dog was admitted to a specialty hospital emergency service upon referral for suspected gastrointestinal foreign body obstruction. Free abdominal fluid was collected, and results of cytologic evaluation were consistent with a septic abdomen. An abdominal barium study revealed free gas and intraperitoneal barium, along with an obstructive gas pattern within the small bowel. Ultrasonography revealed a full-thickness jejunal perforation. On exploratory laparotomy, the perforation was noted to be located mid-jejunum with no associated mass or foreign material. A resection and anastomosis were completed. Histopathologic evaluation of the affected jejunal tissue showed aberrant gastric glandular epithelium consistent with a gastric choristoma, or heterotopic gastric tissue. Key clinical message: Clinicians should consider gastric glandular choristoma as a differential diagnosis in cases of seemingly idiopathic small intestinal perforation with no known cause (i.e., foreign body penetration, neoplasia, NSAID use), and histopathologic evaluation should always be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Perforation jéjunale et abdomen septique résultant d’un choristome chez un chien. Une chienne berger allemand stérilisée âgée de 4,6 ans a été admise dans le service d’urgence d’un hôpital spécialisé après avoir été référée pour une suspicion d’obstruction gastro-intestinale par un corps étranger. Du liquide abdominal libre a été prélevé et les résultats de l’évaluation cytologique étaient compatibles avec un abdomen septique. Un examen abdominal à l’aide de baryum a révélé du gaz libre et du baryum intrapéritonéal, ainsi qu’un patron de gaz obstructif dans l’intestin grêle. L’échographie a révélé une perforation sur toute l’épaisseur jéjunale. Lors d’une laparotomie exploratoire, il a été constaté que la perforation était située au milieu du jéjunum, sans masse ni corps étranger associé. Une résection et une anastomose ont été réalisées. L’évaluation histopathologique du tissu jéjunal affecté a montré un épithélium glandulaire gastrique aberrant compatible avec un choristome gastrique ou un tissu gastrique hétérotopique.Message clinique clé :Les cliniciens doivent considérer le choristome glandulaire gastrique comme diagnostic différentiel dans les cas de perforation de l’intestin grêle apparemment idiopathique sans cause connue (i.e. pénétration d’un corps étranger, néoplasie, utilisation d’AINS), et une évaluation histopathologique doit toujours être effectuée pour obtenir un diagnostic définitif.(Traduit par Dr Serge Messier)."

We sought to evaluate national community race and ethnicity differences in 2020 and 2021 rates of penetrating trauma. We linked the 2018-2021 National Emergency Medical Services Information System databases to ZIP Code demographics. We stratified encounters into majority race/ethnicity communities (>50% White, Black, or Hispanic/Latino). We used logistic regression to compare penetrating trauma for each community in 2020 and 2021 to a combined 2018-2019 historical baseline. Majority Black and majority Hispanic/Latino communities were compared to majority White communities for each year. Analyses were adjusted for household income. We included 87,504,097 encounters (259,449 penetrating traumas). All communities had increased odds of trauma in 2020 when compared to 2018-2019, but this increase was largest for Black communities (aOR 1.4, [1.3-1.4]; White communities - aOR 1.2, [1.2-1.3]; Hispanic/Latino communities - aOR 1.1. [1.1-1.2]). There was a similar trend of increased penetrating trauma in 2021 for Black (aOR 1.2, [1.2-1.3]); White (aOR 1.2, [1.1-1.2]); Hispanic/Latino (aOR 1.1, [1.1-1.1]). Comparing penetrating trauma in each year to White communities, Black communities had higher odds of trauma in all years (2018/2019 - aOR 3.0, [3.0-3.1]; 2020 - aOR 3.3, [3.3-3.4]; 2021 - aOR 3.3, [3.2-3.2]). Hispanic/Latino also had more trauma each year but to a lesser degree (2018/2019 - aOR 2.0, [2.0-2.0]; 2020 - aOR 1.8, [1.8-1.9]; 2021 - aOR 1.9, [1.8-1.9]).

    "abstract": "The appendix is a small, finger-sized tubular pouch that extends from your large intestine. Regardless, the physiology of the appendix is still unclear. There are several factors that cause appendicitis, such as infection, underlying tumor, constipation, and trauma. Symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, and fever, as well as physical signs such as rebound tenderness and McBurney point/sign, are typical of non-traumatic acute appendicitis. On the other hand, a thorough history and physical examination are paramount for an accurate diagnosis of acute traumatic appendicitis. If the history and physical examination are inconclusive, further evaluation with ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) is advised. Upon reaching an accurate diagnosis, the course of treatment involves an appendectomy and intravenous antibiotics. This case describes a patient who suffered blunt traumatic abdominal injury from a fall resulting in acute appendicitis. For pediatric patients who complain of abdominal pain and present to the emergency department (ED), appendicitis should be on the differential diagnosis list, even if the patient's symptoms started after blunt abdominal trauma. Due to the rarity of appendicitis after trauma, rapid identification necessitates a high index of suspicion."

The discrepancy between the size of the prosthesis and the size of the native aortic valve (mismatch) led to the need to deploy a second prosthesis, which was dislocated into the left ventricular cavity and led to myocardial damage and the development of tamponade. As a result of timely cardiac surgery and effective measures of the emergency support service, both prostheses were removed from the left ventricular cavity, the aortic valve was replaced with a \"Medtronic Hankock No. 25\" biological prosthesis, and the left ventricular myocardial rupture was sutured. In case of the development of such complications during the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure with asystole and cardiac tamponade, it was suggested to conduct cardioplegia (instead of chest compressions).

The patient presented to the emergency department after road traffic accident with a seat belt sign, Exploratory laparotomy unveiled extensive injuries, including complete jejunal transaction, avulsion of the terminal ileum, sigmoid mesentery avulsion, and rectosigmoid junction degloving with left anterolateral muscle destruction forming a traumatic hernia. Surgical interventions included jejunal resection and anastomosis, ileocecal limited resection and anastomosis, lastly Hartmann procedure and left high colostomy creation. Subsequent procedures addressed complications, in form of anastomotic leakage managed with resection of the ileocolic anastomosis and ileostomy creation, Vacuum-Assisted Closure dressing, and biological mesh placement to manage abdominal wall infection and dehiscence. After one year the patient underwent surgery for ileostomy and colostomy reversal, along with abdominal wall reconstruction using biosynthetic mesh. Managing injuries involving the jejunum, ileum, and rectosigmoid requires careful surgical intervention, considering individual cases and surgeon judgment. Our experience highlights the need for a modification in the emergency room policies, advocating immediate computed tomography scans for patients with seat belt signs for early detection and improved outcomes."

Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a rare presentation of perforated colon cancer and represents a surgical emergency due to high mortality rate.  A man in his 80s presented with several days of scrotal pain and weakness. On physical exam he was found to have scrotal edema and erythema and bilateral inguinal hernias. Imaging revealed a large scrotal abscess and concern for necrotizing soft tissue infection. He was taken to the operating room for surgical debridement and exploration and was discovered to have perforated colon within an incarcerated inguinal hernia. He underwent exploratory laparotomy with sigmoid resection and end colostomy creation. Pathology returned demonstrating invasive sigmoid adenocarcinoma. Fournier's gangrene requires a high index of suspicion. It is a rapidly progressing infection associated with high mortality. Early initiation of antibiotics and surgical debridement are mainstays of treatment.

We present a case of a 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a one-month history of abdominal pain in the umbilical region, postprandial fullness, progressive decrease in food intake, 12 kg weight loss, and increased abdominal girth. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a well-defined mass in the jejunoileal area. During the exploratory laparotomy, we identified and excised a fibrotic mass on the mesentery of the ileal jejunum, which was not adherent to the intestines. We discharged the patient with no complications following an uneventful four-day observational period. Histopathological examination, including immunohistochemical staining, confirmed the lesion as a non-pancreatic mesenteric pseudocyst. On the follow-up visit, the patient reported no complications. This case report underscores the solitary, multilocular nature of the jejunoileal MC, distinct for its serosanguineous fluid content.

The pain was described as 10/10 \"tearing\" peri-umbilical pain with radiation to the rectum associated with nausea. Vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination were largely unremarkable at presentation, aside from diffuse tenderness with rebound. Computed tomography revealed a markedly enlarged uterus and large-volume hemoperitoneum and sentinel clot sign, suggesting fibroid as the source of bleeding. Upon re-examination, the patient was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic with worsening hemoglobin, worsening abdominal distension, and a positive focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam. Although the source of bleeding was non-specific, a decision was made by the gynecology and general surgery teams to perform an emergency exploratory laparotomy. A midline vertical incision was made and four liters of blood were evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. The gynecology and general surgery teams thoroughly inspected the abdomen. A myomectomy was performed and good hemostasis was confirmed. The patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit, where she had an uncomplicated post-operative course. She was discharged home on postoperative day 4.

Injuries, such as perforation of the colon and rectum, are among the most commonly reported complications. However, prior studies are unclear regarding the setting in which the complication rates may be minimized. This study aimed to assess whether there was a statistically significant difference among the various extraction methods with regard to complications in the emergency department and operating room. Materials and methods This was a retrospective study of all cases of rectal foreign bodies that were removed in the emergency department at a large county hospital between 1/1/2010 and 12/31/2020. Patients included in this study were adults who were evaluated and treated in the emergency department. Results A total of 78 patients were included in the final analysis. More than half (51.3%, n=40) of the patients were successfully treated in the emergency department. Compared with the emergency department, patients in the operating room were more likely to undergo exploratory laparotomy and colectomy (0% vs. 31.6%, p<0.0001), undergo general anesthesia (84.2% vs. 0%, p<0.0001), have higher complication rates (21% vs. 0%, p=0.0021), and have a longer hospital length of stay (median=1 vs. 0, p<0.0001). Conclusion This study revealed a >50% success rate of rectal foreign body removal in the emergency department without any reported complications. To improve the success rate of bedside retrieval and decrease complications, physicians need to be vigilant, communicative, and compassionate about their evaluations and clinical methodology."

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of FTS, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence. FTS typically occurs after direct penetrating trauma to the volar aspect of an upper extremity digit. Development of a deep space infection that quickly propagates through the flexor tendon sheath of a digit can result in serious structural damage to the hand and place the patient at risk for significant morbidity such as finger amputation or even result in death. Signs of FTS include symmetrical swelling of the affected finger, the affected finger being held in a flexed position, pain on any attempt of passive finger extension, and tenderness along the course of flexor tendon sheath, known as the Kanavel signs. Systemic symptoms such as fevers and chills may occur. Recognition of these signs and symptoms is paramount in diagnosis of FTS, as laboratory and imaging assessment is not typically diagnostic. ED management involves intravenous antibiotics and emergent surgical specialist consultation. An understanding of the presentation and risk factors for development of FTS can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this disease in an expedited fashion."

Our aims were to describe severe and nonsevere early postoperative complications to establish a baseline of care outcomes and to identify subgroups of surgical neonates and procedures for future prospective studies. Electronic health record data were examined retrospectively for a cohort of patients who had general anesthesia from January 26, 2015 to August 31, 2018. Inclusion criteria were full-term infants with postmenstrual age less than 44 weeks or premature infants less than 60 weeks postmenstrual age undergoing nonimaging, noncardiac surgery. Severe postoperative complications were defined as mortality, reintubation, positive blood culture, and surgical site infection. Nonsevere early postoperative outcomes were defined as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, hyperthermia, and readmission within 30 days. About 2569 procedures were performed in 1842 neonates of which 10.9% were emergency surgeries. There were 120 postoperative severe complications and 965 nonsevere postoperative outcomes. Overall, 30-day mortality was 1.8% for the first procedure performed, with higher mortality seen on subgroup analysis for patients who underwent exploratory laparotomy (10.3%) and congenital lung lesion resection (4.9%). Postoperative areas for improvement included hyperglycemia (13.9%) and hypothermia (7.9%). The mortality rate in our study was comparable to other studies of neonatal surgery despite a high rate of emergency surgery and a high prevalence of prematurity in our cohort. The early outcomes data identified areas for improvement, including prevention of postoperative glucose and temperature derangements. Neonates in this cohort were at risk for severe and nonsevere adverse postoperative outcomes. Future studies are suggested to improve mortality and adverse event rates."

Anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonist and direct oral anticoagulants, are increasingly utilized, and clinicians may question the necessity of reversal in patients with minor ICH, especially in the setting of increased risk of adverse events. This study aimed to identify a population of patients with minor traumatic ICH at low risk for poor-neurologic status where anticoagulant reversal may not improve outcomes. This retrospective cohort study utilized data accessed from 35 trauma centers from 2018 to 2021. Patients included had a preinjury anticoagulant regimen, ICH due to blunt trauma, Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) head score from 2 to 4, and an AIS of ≤1 for non-head regions within 24 h of hospital arrival. Patients were excluded if they required an emergent neurosurgical procedure or were on a preinjury purinergic-P2 receptor-12 protein (P2Y12) inhibitor. The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital mortality or hospice. There were 654 patients on preinjury anticoagulation who were included with a minor traumatic ICH without neurologic deficits. Overall, 263 patients were reversed and 391 were not reversed. Twelve (4.6%) patients with in-hospital mortality or hospice were reversed compared with 19 (4.91%) patients who were not reversed (p = 0.861). A composite of hospital complications occurred in 21 (8%) reversed patients and 34 (8.7%) not reversed patients (p = 0.748). The average intensive care unit length of stay was 1.4 ± 3.4 days in the reversed group and 1.1 ± 1.8 days in the not reversed group (p = 0.069). This study found no difference in hospital outcomes between patients with minor traumatic ICH on oral anticoagulants who were neurologically intact that were reversed versus those who were not reversed. Further studies should continue to define the subset of traumatic ICH patients who may not require reversal of anticoagulation."

    "abstract": "Iatrogenic distal coronary artery perforation can be a life-threatening complication. While there are different dedicated devices for the embolization of distal perforations, there are scarce data about the embolization using the fragmented balloon catheter, the so-called cut balloon technique (CBT). We included consecutive patients with distal coronary perforations treated with CBT in four cardiac centers between 2017 and 2023. Clinical, angiographic and procedural characteristics as well as in-hospital outcomes were recorded. Twenty-six patients (68% men, mean age: 71 ± 10.6 years) with 25 distal coronary perforations and one septal collateral perforation were included. Eleven patients (42%) had elective percutaneous coronary intervention, while fifteen patients (58%) were treated for acute coronary syndrome. The site of perforation was most frequently distributed in the left anterior descending artery (40%), followed by the circumflex artery (28%) and right coronary artery (24%). The diameter of balloons for CBT ranged from 1.5 to 4.0 mm, with most balloons (76%) being either 2.0 or 2.5 mm in diameter. Most balloons (88%) were previously used for lesion predilatation. The numbers of cut balloons needed to seal the perforation were 1, 2 and ≥3 in 48%, 20% and 32% of cases, respectively. The in-hospital prognosis was favorable, with cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis in only four (16%) patients. Neither emergency surgery nor cardiac death occurred. CBT is a safe, efficient and easy-to-implement technique for the embolization of coronary perforations. Most distal coronary perforations can be sealed with one or two fragments of cut balloons, obviating the need for additional devices."

    "abstract": "Falls are the second most common cause of injury associated with mortality worldwide and an important type of blunt trauma, which forms a significant percentage of traumatic accidents and emergency department admissions. Falling from a tree is an important problem because of its effect on one's health owing to infirmity caused by injuries, most commonly spinal injuries, and the economic burden that accompanies it. A retrospective chart analysis was performed including all the patients with falls from heights who presented to a tertiary care hospital in South India during the summer months of 2018, 2019, and 2020. A structured case record form was used to capture information such as basic demographics, tree species, reason for climbing the tree, and mode of fall, along with the clinical profile, and outcomes from the cases selected from the emergency department registers and cross verified using ICD codes. Despite the existing lockdown due to COVID, an unusual increase in the number of patients getting admitted to the triage with a fall from tree was noted in the year 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. The most common type of injuries sustained were spinal injuries. Burst fractures were leading types of fractures in the patients with spinal injury. The second most common type of injuries involved were of extremities, with lower extremities more than upper extremities. Two patients had inhospital mortality within 30 days. Falls from a tree are a neglected and preventable mechanism of trauma with a significant socio-economic impact, as most of the patients are young or middle aged earning members of their families. The burden of this mode of injury is primarily on rural and agricultural communities. Pre-hospital services in areas with vast agroforestry cultivation require dedicated first response clinics. Lockdowns and geographic isolation during disasters or disease outbreaks must also factor in a supply of essential commodities and warrant treatment on an urgent basis to reduce the need and risk of injury from forestry and agricultural activities."

    "abstract": "The most challenging lower extremity traumatic injuries involve concomitant vascular and orthopedic injuries with amputation rates approaching 50%. Controversy exists as to how to prioritize the vascular and orthopedic repairs. We reviewed patients with popliteal artery and lower extremity orthopedic injuries to analyze the sequence of the vascular and orthopedic repairs on outcomes. All adult patients with a diagnosis of concomitant popliteal artery and lower extremity fracture or dislocation were identified through a review of an institutional trauma registry performed at a level 1 trauma center from 2014 to 2019. Patient demographics, timing of presentation, injury severity score (ISS), surgical interventions, and limb outcome data were collected and examined. The sequence of operative repairs and factors influencing the operative order were analyzed. Twenty-nine patients were treated for popliteal artery injuries. Twelve of these 29 patients had concomitant popliteal artery and orthopedic fractures requiring surgical repair. Injury mechanisms included both blunt (50%, 6/12) and penetrating trauma (50%, 6/12); the majority involved femur fractures (58%, 7/12). Vascular repair included arterial bypass (75%, 9/12) or interposition grafts (25%, 3/12). Orthopedic repair included external fixation (83%, 10/12) and open reduction internal fixation (17%, 2/12). Vascular repair was performed first in 7/12 limbs (58%). Patients having vascular repair first had a trend toward lower blood pressure on arrival (P = 0.068). There was no significant difference in emergency department to operating room (OR) time, OR time, ISS, mangled extremity severity score, estimated blood loss, or blood transfusion for the sequence of operative repair. Fasciotomy was nearly ubiquitous, present in 11/12 patients (92%). There were no graft complications related to orthopedic manipulation, and there were no reported limb-length to graft-length discrepancies. Early limb salvage trended lower in the cohort with revascularization first (71% vs. 100%, P = 0.19). Of the remaining limbs available for follow-up, limb salvage at 4.25 years is 100%. In this small study of patients with concomitant lower extremity popliteal artery and orthopedic injuries, the order of operative repair does not appear to influence the success of revascularization."

    "abstract": "Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is fatal and requires thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for its optimal management. Performing TEVAR requires multidisciplinary specialists and supportive facilities.  We report a case of an 89-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with blunt trauma. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) revealed grade II aortic injury with disrupted blood flow to the left kidney. Sudden paralysis of the left lower extremity and distal progression of the aortic dissection occurred. However, TEVAR could not be performed immediately. Therefore, an external shunt from the right common femoral artery to the left lower extremity was created with angioplasty, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenting, and celiac artery (CA) balloon dilatation. The patient's condition stabilized, and he was transferred to a hospital where TEVAR was performed. Selective arterial catheterization (SAC) for treating intraperitoneal organ malperfusion caused by BTAI may be an effective bridging therapy for TEVAR."

    "abstract": "A 74-year-old man who recently undergone a definitive pacemaker implantation with an apical septal active lead fixation presented to the emergency department because of a new-onset acute chest pain that began soon after cough episodes. Pacemaker interrogation reported an increased bipolar pacing threshold (3.25 V at 1 ms). Contrast-enhanced chest CT scan and percutaneous angiography revealed the sequential perforation of the right ventricular apex and the left internal mammary artery by the ventricular pacemaker lead. Successful percutaneous embolization of the LIMA, blood transfusion and thoracentesis were then performed, and the patient subsequently underwent a percutaneous ventricular lead extraction followed by re-implantation, with an uneventful follow-up after 2 years. This unique case report highlights a potential rare complication of the active fixation of the ventricular lead at the apical interventricular septum and should lead the clinicians to keep in mind right ventricular perforation, even without cardiac tamponade, in patients presenting for cardio-pulmonary symptoms soon after pacemaker implantation."

Rupture of ovarian cysts is infrequent, and cyst infections are even rarer. Here, we report an unusual case involving a young, non-pregnant woman who presented acutely with features of peritonitis and sepsis and was found to have a complex adnexal mass. Following a rigorous diagnostic evaluation, which included an urgent exploratory laparotomy and salpingo-oophorectomy, common diagnoses including tubo-ovarian abscess, endometriotic cyst and pelvic tuberculosis were ruled out. Instead, she was diagnosed with an ovarian mucinous cystadenoma that had become infected, possibly due to pelvic inflammatory disease, leading to spontaneous rupture. Such a presentation has rarely been reported, especially in a non-pregnant setting. Therefore, we emphasise the importance of considering this rare complication as a potential differential diagnosis in similar clinical presentations and discuss the management implications, including the importance of adequately treating pelvic inflammatory disease."

    "abstract": "Adult Hirschsprung's disease (AHD) is a rare condition characterized by a shortened aganglionic segment in the distal colon or rectum that is diagnosed after the age of 10. Diagnostic challenges stem from its rarity, nonspecific presentation, and often delayed consideration following emergent interventions. This report details the case of a 33-year-old male who presented with chronic constipation and abdominal pain, leading to a severe bowel obstruction attributed to self-reported Hirschsprung's disease (HD). Clinical, radiological, and historical aspects were suggestive of AHD, but definitive diagnostic procedures, including manometry and biopsy, were hindered by the patient's deteriorating condition. Exploratory laparotomy unveiled a secondary small bowel obstruction due to volvulus, necessitating immediate intervention, resulting in the removal of 4000 cc of fecal material. A comprehensive resection involving mid-to-distal transverse colon, left colon, sigmoid colon, and proximal rectum with the creation of Hartman's colostomy was performed due to the patient's worsening clinical status. We present a case of possible ultrashort-segment Hirschsprung's disease (USHD) and sketch a classic presentation of AHD. This endeavor aims to enhance awareness and consideration of AHD and/or USHD within the spectrum of potential diagnoses for chronic constipation when relevant and demonstrate the effectiveness of surgical intervention in this population."

    "abstract": "A small bowel perforation occurring in isolation as a result of blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) is a rare event, especially in pediatric patients. The unusual presentation and lack of distinct clinical indications can pose a challenge in promptly diagnosing this condition. This study seeks to underscore the importance of early detection and immediate surgical intervention when dealing with small bowel perforations following BAT. A 13-year-old girl arrived at the emergency department after falling from a cliff. Initial evaluations, including a physical examination and imaging studies, did not uncover any notable irregularities. Nevertheless, the persistent abdominal discomfort and pain prompted further concerns. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan was performed, confirming ileal perforation. The patient subsequently underwent exploratory laparotomy, which resulted in successful surgical treatment. BAT causes increased intraluminal pressure, leading to blowout perforation of the small bowel. Diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in the absence of immediate symptoms or conclusive radiographic findings. Close observation and repeated examinations are essential to detect delayed perforations. Early surgical intervention within 12 h of injury has been shown to significantly reduce complications and mortality rates. Isolated small bowel perforation is a rare occurrence in pediatric patients, and timely diagnosis and surgical intervention are crucial for favorable outcomes. Diagnostic imaging, like contrast-enhanced computerized tomography, helps identify the condition when clinical findings are inconclusive. Comprehensive counseling is essential for patients and their families to understand potential risks and intervention needs, ensuring appropriate management, and treatment delays."

    "abstract": "Penile fractures are a rare urological emergency. It is defined as 'rupture of the tunica albuginea of one or both corpora cavernosa. The corpus spongiosum and the urethra may also be involved in this process.' The tunica albuginea is stiff and significantly thinner during erection than in the flaccid state, which is when injury generally happens. This case series was completed between January 2018 and January 2023 at the Department of General Surgery. Eighteen patients suspected of having penile fractures participated in were included this study. All patients were thoroughly evaluated upon hospital admission to identify the diagnosis, length of time since the accident, the site of the fracture, the extent of the penile hematoma, occurrence of blood at the external meatus, presence of urine retention, and intraoperative outcomes. The patients were between the ages of 24 and 70, with a mean age of 37. The duration before the presentation ranged from 7 h to 1 month (the median was 22 h). Sexual intercourse was the cause in 12 (66%) cases, rolling in the bed in three cases (16%), and blunt trauma in three cases (kicking and the edge of the bed) (16%). Pain and swelling were present in all of the patients. In 15 patients (or 83%), there was evidence of penile deviation. At presentation, 15 (72%) patients reported experiencing rapid detumescence, discomfort, and penile swelling after hearing a cracking (popping) sound. None of these individuals experienced urine retention or urethral hemorrhage, and all were emptied on their own following the episode. Physical examination showed penile ecchymosis, swelling, and substantial discomfort when the penile shaft was examined. All but three patients had an evident penile deformity. Surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia in 14 (77.7%) patients. Four patients with a delayed presentation (more than 1 week) were managed conservatively. As a true urologic emergency, penile fractures should be treated immediately to reduce pain and swelling and ensure better functional and esthetic outcomes. Despite taking more time, a subcoronal circumcising degloving incision is the ideal method because it is exploratory and esthetically pleasing."

    "abstract": "Intraoral injuries are frequently encountered in emergency departments due to children's desire and curiosity to put objects in their mouths. However, forward falls with objects in children's mouths can cause impalement injuries to soft palate, retropharyngeal-peritonsillar, and retromolar tissues, leading to serious morbidity and even mortality. These transoral (soft palate, pharynx-tonsil, retromolar region) penetration injuries can especially result in damage to major vascular structures like the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) due to their close proximity. Dissection, thrombosis, and subsequent stroke can occur in the delicate ICA as a result. In the presented case, a 3-year-old male child experienced internal carotid artery dissection following penetrating injury with a pen, as demonstrated by imaging studies. A literature review is provided along with the case of this child, who developed a reduction in middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow due to thrombosis in the ICA. The study encompasses all penetrating oropharyngeal traumas reported in individuals aged 0-18 years from 1936 to 2023. A search in PubMed and Google Scholar using keywords such as 'internal carotid artery injury,' 'penetrating trauma,' and 'children' yielded 78 case reports from a pool of 36,000 studies. The analysis excludes injuries in areas like tongue, cheek, gums, lips, and floor of the mouth, post-tonsillectomy injuries, and those from sudden braking vehicles.

He developed immediate but transient neurological symptoms that had resolved on arrival to hospital. Radiological imaging of his chest showed small bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumopericardium and pneumomediastinum. In view of this he was treated with high flow normobaric oxygen rather than recompression, because of the risk of development of tension pneumothorax upon chamber decompression. There was no relapse of his neurological symptoms with this regimen. The utility and safety of free ascent training for recreational divers is discussed, as is whether a pneumothorax should be vented prior to recompression, as well as return to diving following pulmonary barotrauma."

The patient underwent vena cava ligation and primary gastric repair. The patient, who was hypotensive and intubated in the post-operative intensive care unit, died on the second day after the operation. Because of the risk of sudden hypotension and shock from massive bleeding, gastro-caval fistula should be kept in mind in penetrating trauma; a rapid diagnosis should be made using a contrast-enhanced CT scan."

The study objective was to examine EMS-witnessed traumatic arrests to define patients who survived hospital discharge. Patients sustaining EMS-witnessed traumatic arrest and entered into the National Trauma Data Bank were included (2007-2018). Mortality defined groups: survival to hospital discharge vs. in-hospital death vs. death in ED/declared dead on arrival (DOA). ANOVA/Chi-square compared cohorts. Multivariable analysis established factors associated with survival out of ED and to hospital discharge. After exclusions, 14,177 patients met the criteria: 10% survived, 22% died in hospital, and 68% died in ED/DOA. Survivors tended to be female (33% vs. 23% vs. 23%, p < 0.001), blunt traumas (71% vs. 56% vs. 60%, p < 0.001), have higher scene GCS (15 [7-15] vs. 3 [3-11] vs. 3 [3-7], p < 0.001), and lower injury severity (ISS 13 [7-26] vs. 27 [18-41] vs. 25 [10-30], p < 0.001), particularly of the head (AIS 0 [0-2] vs. 0 [0-4] vs. 1 [0-4], p < 0.001). Survival to hospital discharge was independently associated with higher field GCS (OR 1.252, p < 0.001) and SBP (OR 1.006, p < 0.001), and Head AIS scores (OR 1.073, p < 0.001). Increasing age (OR 0.984, p < 0.001), higher ISS (OR 0.975, p < 0.001), male sex (OR 0.695, p < 0.001), and penetrating mechanism of injury (OR 0.537, p < 0.001) were associated with reduced survival to discharge. After EMS-witnessed traumatic cardiac arrest, survivors were more likely to be young, female, injured by blunt trauma, and less hypotensive/comatose on-scene. These findings may have implications for ED resuscitation or declaration of care futility and should be further investigated with a prospective multicenter study."

CT demonstrated clot mainly in the anterior pericardium, and emergent operation was performed. Bleeding from the anterior wall of the ascending aorta was repaired by placing one stitch. Postoperatively the patient remained unconscious, and CT of the brain showed hypoxic encephalopathy. After prolonged ventilator management, he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital.

We aimed to describe the implementation of mandatory alcohol screening and the AUDIT tool among trauma patients admitted to a level 1 trauma center in a country with a partial ban on alcohol consumption. This was a retrospective analysis of trauma patients (>12 years old) who required hospital admission and underwent blood alcohol concentration (BAC) screening between 2014 and 2019. This was achieved via an enzymatic method using alcohol dehydrogenase for ethanol detection in the plasma and serum samples. Trauma patients with a BAC <2.2 mmol/L were referred to as \"negative\", and BAC >2.2 mmol/L was referred to as \"BAC positive\". A comparative analysis was performed between the two BAC groups. Alcohol Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral for Treatment [ASBIRT] program, and AUDIT were applied. A total of 7326 BAC screening tests were performed on 7284 patients during the study period. With slight variation over the years, the compliance rate was 77% (70.4%-85.3%), and the test positivity rate was 10% (8.6%-12.5%). There were 42 repeated admissions, of which seven patients were BAC positive at every admission. Young age and non-Arab patients were more likely to test positive, and the main mechanism of injury (MOI) was road traffic-related trauma (p < 0.05). Assault and self-inflicted injuries were significantly higher in BAC-positive patients than in BAC-negative patients (18% vs. 4% and 2.7% vs. 1.3%, respectively; p = 0.001). The injury severity score (ISS) and mortality rate were comparable between the study groups. Patients with a positive BAC were significantly more likely to undergo pan-CT scan in the emergency department, intubation, and exploratory laparotomy than those with a negative BAC. In patients who sustained injuries due to assault, all-terrain vehicles, or motorcycle crashes, there was a significant association between the positivity of BAC tests and the patient's ISS. Despite improvements in BAC screening in trauma admissions over the years, almost 20% of cases were missed. Although the mortality rates were comparable, alcohol consumption burdens resources in terms of excess imaging, intubation, open abdominal surgery, and possible disability. Further studies are needed to understand the key obstacles and challenges to achieving optimum compliance for screening in trauma settings."

Bicycles and motorbikes are considered high risk for road traffic accidents accounting for 9-17% % of all blunt trauma. We present a case of assessment and management of isolated blunt testicular trauma in a tertiary care hospital. A 36-year-old gentleman presented to the accident and emergency department with testicular pain after a road traffic accident while riding a motorcycle. On arrival, he was fully conscious and denied any other injuries. On examination, he had bruising and gross swelling of the right hemiscrotum. Ultrasound of the scrotum revealed testicular rupture and emergency exploration was undertaken which confirmed the diagnosis. Testis was non-salvageable therefore orchidectomy was done. The patient had unremarkable post-operative recovery. A majority of testicular ruptures are secondary to blunt trauma mainly caused by sport-related injuries and road traffic accidents. Ultrasonography remains a non-invasive modality to investigate testicular injuries with a sensitivity of 100%. When not available in an emergency setting, scrotal exploration should be undertaken for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Surgical repair done within 72 hours yields a 90% salvage rate after which the salvage rate is reduced significantly. Tumor markers should be checked in patients managed conservatively. Early assessment and diagnosis are crucial in the management of acute testicular rupture. Early intervention can salvage injured testes and an orchidectomy can be avoided."

On the 49th day, she became febrile again, and computed tomography showed increased pericardial effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed the large pericardial effusion and revealed a pseudoaneurysm on the inferior of the left ventricular wall, with blood flowing from the pseudoaneurysm into the pericardial space. Urgent surgical intervention was performed to repair a myocardial defect as a left ventricular pseudoaneurysm had ruptured in the pericardium. The patient recovered and was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation after 108 days of hospitalization. Purulent pericarditis can be a lethal complication; therefore, careful follow-up and strict adherence to therapeutic strategies, including the use of imaging technologies such as echocardiography, are important."

    "title": "A Complicated Case of Strangulated Inguinal Hernia of the Sigmoid Colon With Secondary Ischemic-Compromise of Scrotal Tissue: A Multi-Disciplinary Surgical Approach.",
    "abstract": "Inguinal hernia is amongst the most common acute abdominal disease that presents in the Emergency Department (ED). Pathologically, it involves the displacement and herniation of abdominal, pelvic, or groin tissue through weaknesses in the abdominal wall. Many inguinal hernias are simple and asymptomatic, managed conservatively without the need for surgical intervention. However, under rare circumstances, hernias are susceptible to significant complications requiring emergent surgery. This report follows the case of a 61-year-old Hispanic-American male presenting to the ED with signs of a complex strangulated inguinal hernia and consequent infarction of the testis with Fournier's Gangrene. Clinical evaluation elucidated a one-week worsening abdominal pain, non-reducible painful inguinal hernia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, groin discoloration, dysuria, and a history of failed primary hernia repair during childhood. The patient underwent emergent surgery to excise ischemic-necrotic portions of the sigmoid colon, creation of end-colostomy, non-mesh repair of inguinal hernia, and right-sided complete orchiectomy with the removal of adjacent scrotal-Dartos tissues and spermatic cord due to Fournier's Gangrene. This report provides both a report for a potentially preventable consequence in one of the most common surgical presentations and a review of the multi-disciplinary expertise that is required in the surgical management of complex inguinal hernias."

    "abstract": "Cardiac contusion is rarely diagnosed in patients with blunt chest trauma in the emergency department, especially if patients are asymptomatic. We present a case of a 43-year-old man whose diagnosis of left anterior descending artery (LAD) dissection after blunt chest trauma was delayed. The patient presented to the emergency department of a remote district hospital after a motorcycle accident, asymptomatic with a mildly reduced level of consciousness due to a very small subdural hemorrhage. Ten days later, when he developed a syncopal attack due to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE), his first performed electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with QS waves and slight ST elevation in leads V2-V6. The subsequent coronary angiography showed left anterior descending artery dissection, and the diagnosis was nicely depicted with optical coherence tomography (OCT). A drug-eluting stent was implanted with a good angiographic result. This case highlights the significance of early recognition of traumatic coronary dissection, which should be excluded even in asymptomatic patients with a plain ECG acquisition, for the appropriate management and prevention of unfavorable outcomes."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits, with rare complications necessitating immediate surgical intervention. This case report discusses diagnosis and treatment, emphasizing the importance of prompt intervention. A 45-year-old male with dentures presented with acute left abdominal pain. Diagnostic tests identified a foreign body in the descending colon, leading to laparoscopic surgery. Early laparoscopy offers a safe and reliable alternative to exploratory laparotomy. This case underscores the significance of swift diagnosis, preventing severe complications like peritonitis, obstruction, and hemorrhage. In conclusion, while foreign body ingestion is common, intestinal perforation remains extremely rare. Physicians should consider it in their differential diagnosis, with computed tomography (CT) and rapid surgical intervention as crucial components of proper management."

    "abstract": "Trauma, both penetrating and blunt, consists of a significant percentage of surgical admissions in Caribbean hospitals. Due to financial constraints, ideal resources for optimal surgical management are not always available. Despite these disadvantages, successful outcomes for complex, emergent cases are achieved through a combination of timely clinical assessment, intervention, and ingenuity in using the resources at hand. In this case report, we describe a 17-year-old male who suffered major visceral injuries and presented in extremis from a single gunshot wound. While fleeing the scene of a crime, he was shot in his right pelvis, with the projectile exiting his left thorax. Injuries matching a transaxial gunshot trajectory that crossed the diaphragm and involved the pelvic, abdominal, and thoracic cavities were found on exploratory laparotomy. He survived through prompt surgical intervention and aggressive resuscitation during his postoperative intensivist care, a resource often unavailable in this setting. The patient's prognosis would have been guarded even in a developed country setting. This case highlights the potential that Caribbean healthcare institutes possess, and that given an improvement in resources, we can aim to match a developed country's standard of healthcare."

    "title": "Survival Secrets: Unmasking the Factors Predicting Failure of Non-operative Management (NOM) in Splenic Injuries.",
    "abstract": "Splenic injuries are common solid organ injuries resulting from blunt abdominal trauma in road traffic accidents. Very often, splenic injuries can be life-threatening. Earlier, splenic injuries were often dealt with surgical intervention, such as splenectomy. With the recognition of the immunological function of the spleen and possible complications of splenectomy surgery, such as overwhelming post-splenectomy infections (OPSI), there has been a recent trend for non-operative management (NOM). To study the variables predicting failure of NOM in blunt abdominal trauma patients with splenic injury. This is a retrospective study that includes 235 patients who presented to the Safdarjung Hospital emergency room (New Delhi, India) with blunt trauma abdomen and splenic injuries with or without associated injuries between January 2019 and December 2021. The data was entered in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Pearson's chi-square test of association was used to determine if there is a relationship between two variables. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Out of 235 patients with blunt abdominal trauma and splenic injuries, 82 were hemodynamically unstable despite resuscitation and were taken up for emergency laparotomy. The remaining 153 patients, who were either hemodynamically stable or stabilized after adequate resuscitation, were managed on the lines of NOM. The number of patients with splenic injury in AAST grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 was 36, 50, 40, 24, and three, respectively. Out of 153 patients, 130 (85%) were successfully managed by NOM, while eight (5%) had to discontinue NOM as they required surgical intervention. The failure of NOM (fNOM) is seen mostly with grade 5 injuries (2/2, 100%, p<0.01), followed by grade 4 (4/20, 20%) and grade 3 (2/37, 5.7%). The mean age in fNOM was 58.3 years, as compared to 42.2 years in the success of NOM (sNOM). All eight patients had multiple concomitant injuries, with femur fracture being the most common association in up to six patients (p<0.01), followed by liver injury in four patients. There were 15 mortalities, irrespective of AAST severity grade. All of these patients had associated concomitant injuries, with intracranial bleeding (n = 10, 32%, p<0.01) being the most common association, followed by femur fracture (n = 6, 20%) and liver injury (n = 5, 16%). Also, the cause of death was unrelated to splenic trauma (p = 0.67), with pulmonary embolism (n = 6, 40%, p<0.01) being the most common cause, followed by brain stem herniation (n = 5, 34%). Non-operative management is a safe and efficient method for treating patients with splenic injuries who are hemodynamically stable or stabilized. The factors associated with fNOM include elderly age, a higher American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade of splenic injury, and associated concomitant injuries. Femur fracture was the most common concomitant injury present in cases where NOM failed, followed by liver injury. The presence of intracranial bleeds in these patients was a common association with mortality, irrespective of the grade of splenic injury."

    "abstract": "Primary hypothyroidism is a commonly encountered endocrine disorder and can be associated with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in severe cases. Early detection of hypothyroidism is key since it is a potentially treatable and reversible cause of pericardial effusions. A 53-year-old female was admitted following a fall. The clinical history was remarkable, with symptoms of persistent tiredness and fatigue for six months. She had no known medical conditions and was not taking any regular medications. Vital signs were stable. Physical examination revealed bilateral pitting pedal oedema and a tense abdomen with shifting dullness. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal. Notably, the patient exhibited delayed relaxation of deep-tendon reflexes bilaterally at the patellar and ankle sites. Pertinent laboratory findings showed an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 151.69 milliunits/L, a low free thyroxine (fT4) level of <5.4 pmol/L, a haemoglobin level of 85 g/L, and a markedly high anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody level of 957.35 IU/mL. An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a low-voltage QRS complex. Chest X-ray findings indicated cardiomegaly suggestive of left heart failure. An emergent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a large pericardial effusion measuring 5.4 cm posterior to the left ventricle. The most likely aetiology in this case was severe primary hypothyroidism. She initially received intravenous liothyronine 10 micrograms every four hours, followed by oral liothyronine 5 micrograms twice a day in conjunction with levothyroxine 100 micrograms once a day. The adrenal reserve assessment was satisfactory. An urgent pericardiocentesis was performed, draining a total of 900 mL of serosanguinous fluid. Serial echocardiograms demonstrated the absence of residual effusion. Hypothyroidism is a relatively uncommon cause of pericardial effusion. By ensuring early detection and appropriate treatment, we can optimise patient outcomes and prevent potential complications associated with untreated hypothyroidism."

    "abstract": "Intrauterine volvulus is an extremely rare disorder. Its diagnosis is difficult to make antenatally, unless typical pictures are obtained. Owing to its high morbidity and mortality, intensive monitoring of the fetal condition is mandatory. Here, we report a patient, gravida 4, para 1 (G4P1), who had suffered from preterm labor and diminishing fetal movement and was brought to the emergency unit after her 35th week of pregnancy. Ultrasonography was performed to reveal a fetus with a markedly distended bowel (18 mm in width). Intestinal obstruction related to intrauterine volvulus was highly suspected. The fetus was delivered via Cesarean section because of its deteriorated abdominal condition. Urgent exploratory laparotomy was done by a pediatric surgeon to relieve the bowel obstruction on the second day after birth, on the account of poor improvement of the newborn. The newborn did well after segmental resection and was subsequently followed up at the pediatric outpatient clinic. In conclusion, early detection, intensive monitoring, prompt delivery, and urgent surgical intervention are the key to save the fetal life and neonatal health."

We determined rates of prehospital C-SMR and concomitant radiographic injury patterns. A retrospective trauma registry and chart review was conducted for all adult blunt trauma patients who were transported by EMS and hospitalized with radiographic cervical spine injuries from 2011 to 2019 at a level 1 trauma center. Of 658 admitted blunt trauma patients with confirmed cervical spine injury by imaging, 117 (17.8%) did not receive prehospital C-SMR. Patients without prehospital C-SMR were significantly older (76 vs 54 years), more often had low fall as mechanism of injury (59.8% vs 15.9%) and had lower Injury Severity Score (10 vs 17). Patients without C-SMR (Non-SMR) experienced the full array of cervical spine injury types and locations. While the non-SMR patients most often had dens fractures,C-SMR patients most often had C7 fractures; frequencies of fractures at the remaining vertebral levels were comparable. On MRI, cervical spinal cord (8.5% vs 19.6%) and ligamentous injuries (5.1% vs 12.6%) occurred less often in non-SMR patients. Approximately 8.5% of non-SMR patients and 20% of C-SMR patients required cervical spine surgery. Patients without prehospital C-SMR demonstrate a broad array of cervical spine injuries. While the rates of certain cervical injuries are lower in prehospital non-SMR patients, they are not insignificant. Level III."

    "abstract": "Prehospital tracheal intubation (TI) is associated with increased mortality in patients with penetrating trauma, and the utility of prehospital advanced airway management is debated. The increased incidence of deadly violence in Sweden warrants a comprehensive evaluation of current airway management for patients with penetrating trauma in the Swedish prehospital environment and on arrival in the emergency department (ED). This was an observational, multicenter study of all patients with penetrating trauma and injury severity scores (ISSs) ≥ 15 included in the Swedish national trauma register (SweTrau) between 2011 and 2019. We investigated the frequency and characteristics of prehospital and ED TI, including 30-day mortality and patient characteristics associated with TI. Of 816 included patients, 118 (14.5%) were intubated prehospitally, and 248 (30.4%) were intubated in the ED. Patients who were intubated prehospitally had a higher ISS, 33 (interquartile range [IQR] 25, 75), than those intubated in the ED, 25 (IQR 18, 34). Prehospital TI was associated with a higher associated mortality, OR 4.26 (CI 2.57, 7.27, p < 0.001) than TI in the ED, even when adjusted for ISS (OR 2.88 [CI 1.64, 5.14, p < 0.001]). Hemodynamic collapse (≤ 40 mmHg) and low GCS score (≤ 8) were the characteristics most associated with prehospital TI. Traumatic cardiac arrests (TCAs) occurred in 154 (18.9%) patients, of whom 77 (50%) were intubated prehospitally and 56 (36.4%) were intubated in the ED. A subgroup analysis excluding TCA showed that patients with prehospital TI did not have a higher mortality rate than those with ED TI, OR 2.07 (CI 0.93, 4.51, p = 0.068), with OR 1.39 (0.56, 3.26, p = 0.5) when adjusted for ISS. Prehospital TI was associated with a higher mortality rate than those with ED TI, which was specifically related to TCA; intubation did not affect mortality in patients without cardiac arrest. Mortality was high when airway management was needed, regardless of cardiac arrest, thereby emphasizing the challenges posed when anesthesia is needed. Several interventions, including whole blood transfusions, the implementation of second-tier EMS units and measures to shorten scene times, have been initiated in Sweden to counteract these challenges."

SS presenting as cardiac tamponade is rare, with only a few reported cases in the literature. In this report, we present the case of a patient with SS who arrived at the emergency department with symptoms of light-headedness, palpitations and dyspnoea. Echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, and during treatment, the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia and circulatory collapse. The collaboration between various medical specialties, including emergency medicine, cardiology, critical care, endocrinology and radiology, played a crucial role in successful patient management. The multidisciplinary approach allowed for comprehensive care addressing acute cardiac complications and underlying hormonal deficiencies."

We reviewed cases of traumatic hemopericardium in our center and the role of extracorporeal life support in these cases. From November 2011 to January 2022, 28 patients with significant hemopericardium and suspected cardiac injury were enrolled. In our center, surgery is the primary treatment of choice; however, if the patient is in an unstable condition, extracorporeal life support is administered in the emergency room prior to surgery. Preoperative extracorporeal life support was applied to 10 patients (36 %). Two patients (20 %) were converted from extracorporeal life support to cardiopulmonary bypass during operation. After surgery, 2 patients (20 %) needed postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Overall, 21 patients (75 %) survived; of these, 6 (29 %) received extracorporeal life support. Meanwhile, 7 patients (25 %) died; of these, 4 patients (57 %) received extracorporeal life support. Resuscitation method is the most crucial survival strategy in patients with severe chest trauma. Extracorporeal life support in cases of traumatic hemopericardium may be beneficial and efficient in stabilizing patients prior to surgery."

We assessed the feasibility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), which does not have both problems, at out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) emergency scenes. Included were 10 adults with non-traumatic OHCA in Vienna, Austria. An expert in emergency ultrasound was dispatched to the scenes in addition to the resuscitation team. Feasibility was defined as the ability to collect specific items of information by TEE within 10 min. Descriptive statistics were compiled and hands-off times were compared to a historical control group. TEE examinations were feasible in 9 of 10 cases and prompted changes in clinical management in 2 cases (cardiac tamponade: n = 1; right ventricular dilatation: n = 1). Their mean time requirement was 5.1 ± 1.7 (2.8-8.0) min, and image quality was invariably rated as excellent or good during both compressions and pauses. No TEE-related complications, or interferences with activities of advanced life support were observed. The hands-off times during resuscitation were comparable to a historical control group not involving ultrasound (P = 0.24). Given these feasibility results, we expect that TEE can be used routinely at OHCA emergency scenes."

While clinical presentation could be variable, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for uremic pericarditis especially in patients who miss their dialysis sessions. We present a 77-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on dialysis diagnosed with pericarditis and large pericardial effusion complicated by cardiac tamponade and shock. He underwent urgent pericardiocentesis with clinical improvement. The course of the disease can be complicated by shock with multiorgan failure, particularly the liver. The presentation is relatively acute requiring a high level of suspicion, urgent diagnosis, and management to reduce mortality. As the geriatric population increases with associated comorbid conditions, it would be expected that patients undergoing dialysis would increase. Given the uncommon nature of the disease and how these patients have been managed by multiple specialties and care providers, it is important to consider dialysis-related complications in all patients with end-stage renal disease presenting with dyspnea."

Technological development in devices and imaging techniques, as well as accumulated experience, have increased procedural success rates and decreased complications. Same-day discharge protocols have been proposed in the field of structural heart disease, but this approach has not been studied in detail for the LAAO procedure. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of an outpatient program for LAAO when compared to the conventional treatment approach. We present a retrospective, non-randomized single-center study of 262 consecutive patients undergoing LAAO. Patients were divided into two groups, the first (n = 131) followed a conventional protocol (CP), and the second (n = 131) an outpatient protocol (OP). The primary composite endpoint comprised MACCE (death, stroke, and bleeding), cardiac tamponade, vascular complication, or attendance in the emergency department after hospital discharge at 30 days. The overall success rate was 99.6%, with a periprocedural complication rate of 2.29%. With regards to the CP versus OP group, there were no differences between incidences of the primary composite endpoint (6.1% PC vs. 3.0% PA, p = 0.24), or after an analysis, with propensity score matching. No differences were observed in the individual endpoints. There was a decrease in hospital length of stay in the same-day discharge group (p < 0.01). A same-day discharge LAAO program is safe, effective, and feasible when compared to the conventional strategy. Moreover, it reduces hospital length of stay, which might have clinical and economic benefits."

In our study, we sought to evaluate the incidence, indications, risk factors and maternal as well as fetal outcomes associated with EOH. Also, the study was conducted to review the operative experiences and trend of emergency hysterectomies done for various indications over a period of two years in our tertiary care center. Methods The present hospital-based retrospective analytical study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, L.L.R.M. Medical College, Meerut, between March 2021 to February 2023. All women who delivered within or outside the institute undergoing obstetric hysterectomy were included in our study. Out of a total of 7743 deliveries, 46 EOH cases were found. The data of these 46 EOH deliveries were collected and analyzed after issuing ethical clearance by the Institutional Ethical Committee of L.L.R.M. Medical College, Meerut. Results During the two-year study period, 46 EOH were performed out of 7743 deliveries making an incidence of 0.504 EOH per 100 deliveries. Most of the cases were of multiparous women in the age group of 25 to 35 years (78%). The majority, 43.5% cases belonged to placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), followed by ruptured uterus (30.5%) and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (26%). The most frequent preoperative complication seen in EOH was severe anemia (29, 63%). Intraoperative bladder injury was seen in four cases, along with one case of ureteric injury. Postoperatively, cases were shown to have acute hemorrhagic shock (54.3%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septicemia, wound infection, acute renal failure (ARF), hepatic encephalopathy and psychosis. Four maternal mortalities were observed in our study. Conclusion EOH is a necessary operative procedure in many obstetric emergencies including PAS and PPH. Despite intra-operative risk and possible postoperative complications, it remains a potentially life-saving procedure. Thus various surgeries for PAS and PPH should be the integral part of postgraduate trainings to save the lives of mothers and to reduce the maternal mortality."

There are many ultrasound protocols in shock; each protocol combines core ultrasound elements such as IVC and cardiac assessment which includes detection of cardiac tamponade, left ventricular function and right ventricular strain.Valvular assessment is absent in majority of ultasound protocols, while lung ultrasound is included in some of them. In this study we investigated which parameters used in Echo - US protocol help differentiate shock types. This cross sectional study was conducted on 150 patients with shock (140 patients were included while, 10 patients were excluded).Sensitivity and specificity of different parameters used in the Echo-US protocol were analyzed to detect which parameters can diffentiate shock types. Velocity time integral of Aorta and IVC maximum diameter were good discriminators for distributive shock, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.8885 (95% CI 0.8144 to 0.9406) and 0.7728 (95% CI 0.6832 to 0.8473) (Z = 10.256 p < 0.0001) and (Z = 5.079 p < 0.0001) respectively. Left ventricular systolic function, presence of pneumonia, pneumothorax or valve vegetations were of great value in differentiating shock types, while CUST, FAST, TAPSE and RV diameter were not useful in differentiating shock types. Ultrasound and echocardiography are powerful tools that can be used to identify shock etiology when the clinical picture overlaps."

    "abstract": "Acute aortic dissection Stanford type A (AADA) is a surgical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although surgical management has improved, the optimal therapy is a matter of debate. Different surgical strategies have been proposed for patients under 60 years old. This paper evaluates the postoperative outcome and the need for secondary aortic operation after a limited surgical approach (proximal arch replacement) vs. extended arch repair. Between January 2000 and January 2018, 530 patients received surgical treatment for AADA at our hospital; 182 were under 60 years old and were enrolled in this study - Group A (n=68), limited arch repair (proximal arch replacement), and group B (n=114), extended arch repair (> proximal arch replacement). More pericardial tamponade (P=0.005) and preoperative mechanical resuscitation (P=0.014) were seen in Group A. More need for renal replacement therapy (P=0.047) was seen in the full arch group. Mechanical ventilation time (P=0.022) and intensive care unit stay (P<0.001) were shorter in the limited repair group. Thirty-day mortality was comparable (P=0.117). New onset of postoperative stroke was comparable (Group A four patients [5.9%] vs. Group B 15 patients [13.2%]; P=0.120). Long-term follow-up did not differ significantly for secondary aortic surgery. Even though young patients received only limited arch repair, the outcome was comparable. Full-arch replacement was not beneficial in the long-time follow-up. A limited approach is justified in the cohort of young AADA patients. Exemptions, like known Marfan syndrome and the presence of an intimal tear in the arch, should be considered."

This spike in penetrating trauma has challenged even the most mature pediatric trauma centers. This project aims to identify U.S. pediatric trauma center best practices for the evaluation and resources dedicated to pediatric firearm injuries. This study used an exploratory cross-sectional survey design using a study-specific questionnaire. An electronic survey was distributed to 159 verified U.S. pediatric trauma centers targeting patients younger than 15 years with firearm injuries from 2017 to 2021. Trauma approaches to injury prevention, advocacy, and common performance improvement events were surveyed. A follow-up survey provided a drill-down on the top three performance improvement events. A total 159 surveys were distributed, of which 63 (40%) submitted partial responses and 32 (20%) completed the initial survey in full. A 49% increase in pediatric firearm injuries occurred between 2019 and 2020. Eighty-six percent of the trauma centers identified at least one to two opportunities for improvement events related to firearm injuries, with most of these events requiring a tertiary level of review. The top three performance improvement events included the massive transfusion protocol/fluid resuscitation, emergency department procedures, and operating room resource availability. This study provides the first known examination of U.S. pediatric trauma center quality improvement efforts to address the crisis of pediatric firearm injuries. Our results indicate that most pediatric trauma centers are engaged in quality improvement and resource enhancement to combat firearm injuries."

    "abstract": "Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising method for advanced HCC treatment. There are several clinical trials and meta-analyses of immune checkpoint inhibitors and immune cell therapy, but clinical evidence on the combination of these two therapies is lacking. A 66-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B-related cirrhosis complained of acute abdominal pain in an emergency department of a hospital. On exams, there was a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a large tumor in the right lobe, 13 cm × 17 cm in size, and right portal vein thrombosis. The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was 30,905 mg/dL. Therefore this patient was diagnosed with BCLC stage C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). He underwent trans-arterial chemo-embolization (TACE), abdominal radiotherapy, nivolumab, and lenvatinib. His disease had been under control until two years later, the disease progressed with multiple lung metastases, and his AFP level rose from around 1000 to 17,000 ng/ml. At this stage, he underwent new combination immunotherapy in January 2022. He used pembrolizumab (100 mg) first, and the AFP level decreased by 600 ng/ml daily. Then he received DC-CIK cell therapy two weeks after using pembrolizumab, and the AFP level declined to 900 ng/ml a day. Unfortunately, severe pneumonitis and tension pneumothorax developed after therapy. The patient denied undergoing further treatment and expired peacefully. The previous in-vivo study found that combination immunotherapy can improve tumor control in the mice model. Besides, in previous clinical studies, the level of AFP may be a surrogate marker of tumor response. Therefore we thought the more rapidly declined level of AFP was the clinical evidence of the synergistic effect of checkpoint inhibitors combined with cell therapy in HCC treatment."

    "abstract": "Background  Airway management in case of acute tracheal injury is a challenging situation where the use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) has recently gained more importance. Case Description  We report the case of a 60-year old women with aspiration of a large blister pack tablet causing acute tracheal obstruction with asphyxia as well as tracheal perforation with tension pneumothorax. As bronchoscopy failed to retrieve the blister pack, emergency tracheal reconstruction with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) support was carried out. Conclusion  The application of ECMO instantly alleviated the acute situation and provided excellent conditions for technically demanding emergency tracheal repair."

    "abstract": "The Surgical Apgar Score (SAS) is a 10-point validated score comprised of three intraoperative variables (blood loss, lowest heart rate, and lowest mean arterial pressure). Lower scores are worse and predict major postoperative complications. The SAS has not been applied in emergency general surgery (EGS) but may help guide postoperative disposition. We hypothesize that SAS can predict complications in EGS patients undergoing a laparotomy. We performed a retrospective review of adult patients at a single, quaternary care center who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for EGS conditions within 6 hours of surgical consultation from 2015 to 2019. Patients were grouped by whether they experienced a postoperative complication (systemic, surgical, and/or death). Multivariable regression was performed to predict complications, accounting for SAS and other statistically significant variables between groups. Using this model, predicted probabilities of a complication were generated for each SAS. The cohort comprised 482 patients: 32.8% (n = 158) experienced a complication, while 67.2% (n = 324) did not. Patients with complications were older, frailer, more often male, had worse SAS (6 vs. 7, p < 0.0001) and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, and higher rates of perforated hollow viscus ( p = 0.0003) and open abdomens ( p < 0.0001). On multivariable regression, an increasing SAS independently predicted less complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.96; p = 0.009). An SAS ≤4 was associated with a 49.2% predicted chance of complications, greater rates of septic shock (9.7% vs. 3%, p = 0.01), respiratory failure (20.5% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.02), and death (24.1% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.0001). An SAS ≤ 4 did not correlate with surgical complications ( p = 0.1). The SAS accurately predicts postoperative complications in EGS patients undergoing urgent laparotomy, with an SAS ≤ 4 identifying patients at risk for septic shock, respiratory failure, and mortality. This tool can aid in rapidly determining postoperative disposition and resource allocation. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV."

    "abstract": "This case report presents a complex clinical scenario involving a 71-year-old female with aortic dissection accompanied by hypotension. The patient's initial presentation of sudden loss of consciousness unveiled a large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, leading to emergency surgery. Subsequent diagnostic findings revealed an intramural haematoma with an intimal tear in the ascending aorta. Postoperatively, the patient experienced an ischaemic stroke, necessitating prompt neurology consultation and treatment. This report underscores the significance of early recognition and collaborative management in achieving positive patient outcomes. Early identification of aortic dissection symptoms, such as sudden loss of consciousness and hypotension, is crucial for effective management.Managing aortic dissection involves a multidisciplinary effort with emergency medicine, cardiology and surgical teams working together for optimal patient outcomes.After aortic dissection surgery, staying attentive to potential neurological complications such as ischaemic strokes is essential."

    "abstract": "A penile fracture is a rare urological emergency, often resulting from blunt trauma to the erect penis. This case report describes a 30-year-old male who presented with penile swelling during sexual intercourse, raising suspicion of a penile fracture. The patient underwent surgical exploration, revealing a rent in the tunica albuginea and an additional laceration in the corpus spongiosum with the Foley catheter exposed. The lacerations were closed using Vicryl sutures over a Foley catheter. The patient experienced an uneventful postoperative course, and follow-up assessments showed satisfactory healing of the urethra. This case underlines the need for clinicians to consider the possibility of urethral involvement in cases of penile fracture, as timely surgical intervention can prevent long-term sequelae such as erectile dysfunction and urethral strictures. By sharing this case, we hope to further emphasize the need for vigilance and swift action when faced with potential penile fractures in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Traumatic diaphragmatic injuries (TDIs) are rare and can be life-threatening, depending on the size of the injury and the contents herniating through it. They usually result from blunt or penetrating trauma to the thoracoabdominal area, with an incidence of 0.8-5% and up to 30% presenting late. A high index of suspicion should be maintained when evaluating patients with a history of trauma (severe blunt or thoracoabdominal penetrating trauma) and upper abdominal symptoms. We present a case of a missed TDI after a left posterior thoracoabdominal stab injury, which was evaluated with a diagnostic laparoscopy at an outside hospital. He presented to our emergency department (ED) with sudden onset left-sided chest pain and uncontrollable vomiting. A CT scan was obtained and showed a distended stomach herniating through a defect in the left hemidiaphragm. The patient was immediately taken for laparoscopic exploration and repair. There was a 5 cm defect in the left posterolateral diaphragm containing a strangulated stomach (approximately ⅔) and necrotic omentum. Complete reduction was achieved and the diaphragmatic defect was repaired primarily. His postoperative course was uncomplicated. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for TDI, despite reports of previous exploration. Missed TDI can present with herniated intra-abdominal organs, which can become strangulated and increase morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric abscess, a rare abdominal infection, is regularly mostly secondary to inflammatory bowel disease, diverticula of the small intestine, or tuberculosis. Primary mesenteric abscesses are extremely rare. If not diagnosed and treated in a timely manner, it may lead to serious consequences; computerized tomography is highly beneficial for the diagnosis of this disease; timely surgical intervention, judicious use of antibiotics, and adequate nutritional support are crucial in the management of this disease. A 59-year-old male patient from China was admitted to hospital for intermittent abdominal pain accompanied by poor appetite for 10 days. One week before admission, the patient had been infected with corona virus disease 2019. Past history includes type 2 diabetes and post-operative gastric cancer. The emergency abdominal computerized tomography examination results of the patient suggested that the mesentery was cloudy with a large amount of effusion and visible bubble. Mesentery abscess was considered, but duodenal perforation could not be excluded. We adopted exploratory laparotomy to further clarify the diagnosis. Intraoperatically, after fully exposing the duodenum, we found extensive abscess formation in the mesentery, but no duodenal perforation. After operation, the patient developed duodenal leakage and was treated with gastric tube and jejunal nutrition tube. Postoperatively, due to poor general condition, the patient was transferred to intensive care unit; after anti-infective treatment, the condition improved on the 5th postoperative day, and duodenal leakage appeared on the 9th postoperative day, and conservative treatment was ineffective, and the patient eventually died. Primary mesenteric abscess is a local tissue infectious disease. Whereas we should consider the physical basic condition of the patient during therapeutic process. We believe adequate postoperative drainage, rational use of antibiotics based on bacterial culture, early ambulation after surgery, and adequate nutritional support might be key points for successful therapy."

We describe a case report of a neonatal EDC presenting intestinal obstruction and shock. A 32-d-old male infant with a prenatal sonographic finding of bladder distension was admitted to our hospital for a severely distended abdomen, fever, and oliguria. The first diagnostic hypothesis was septic shock and intestinal obstruction. The patient's symptoms worsened; following an emergency surgical exploratory laparotomy and histopathological findings, the final diagnosis of cecal duplication cyst was confirmed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and on the fifth postoperative day, oral feeding restarted. Twenty days later, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Although EDC located in the cecum is exceptional, it should be considered when evaluating suspected intestinal obstruction and shock."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare benign yet aggressive neoplasm that has an unpredictable biological behavior ranging from spontaneous regression to extensive local infiltration and has a high tendency for recurrence. The presenting symptoms are usually nonspecific and mostly related to the large size of the tumor compressing adjacent organs. Imaging studies can be suggestive of the diagnosis, but confirmation is based on histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. The lack of knowledge on the etiology and pathogenetic behavior of this tumor leads to therapeutic and prognostic challenges. Future genetic studies may help in advancing our understanding of this neoplasm and in formulating the proper management and follow-up plan. Here we present a case of a 14-year-old female who presented to the emergency room complaining of diffuse abdominal pain and distention. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large mass occupying most of the abdominal cavity and compressing adjacent organs. Exploratory laparotomy with resection and anastomosis was performed, and the histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the resected mass was consistent with mesenteric DTF."

Chest radiography demonstrated extensive bilateral infiltrates and an increased cardiothoracic ratio. Streptococcus pneumoniae urine antigen test was positive. ECG demonstrated diffuse ST-segment elevation. An arterial line was placed and demonstrated pulsus paradoxus. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an extensive pericardial effusion, with echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade. Emergency subxiphoid pericardiocentesis was performed with an initial drainage of 750 mL of purulent fluid consistent with pyopericardium. Immediate haemodynamic improvement was observed. The patient required a second pericardiocentesis for drainage of a relapsing pericardial effusion. The course was complicated by effusive-constrictive pericarditis requiring anterior interphrenic pericardiectomy.

    "abstract": "Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following traumatic injury. We examined demographic characteristics, chemoprophylaxis, and outcomes of VTE patients with blunt trauma requiring hospitalization. A retrospective review of adult blunt trauma hospitalizations with and without VTE between 2012 and 2019 was conducted. Deaths in the emergency department were excluded. Univariate and multivariable analyses, including machine learning classification algorithms for VTE, were performed. Of 10,926 admitted adult blunt trauma patients, 177 had VTE events. VTE events occurred at a median of 6 [IQR 3-11] days, with 7.3% occurring within 1 day of admission. VTE patients were more often male, and more often underwent surgery. They had higher injury severity as well as longer intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay. While VTE occurred throughout the spectrum of injury severity, 27.7% had low injury severity (ISS < = 9). In multivariable analyses, both heparin and enoxaparin had reduced adjusted odds ratios for VTE. Approximately 7.3% of VTE events occurred within one day of admission. A substantial proportion of VTE events occurred in patients with low injury severity (ISS < = 9). Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin chemoprophylaxis were both inversely associated with VTE. These findings underscore the need for vigilance for VTE identification in blunt trauma patients throughout their hospitalization and VTE prevention efforts."

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) are relatively common conditions in premature infants with low birth weight (VLBW). However, in the current literature, there are limited case reports of patients with concomitant NEC and PVL. We report a case of a premature female born at a gestational age of 25 weeks and five days who developed cystic intracranial lesions after emergent bowel resection due to NEC. Transcranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of cystic PVL in the right middle cerebral artery distribution. Several observational studies note the association between spontaneous intestinal perforation, surgical NEC, and the presence of cystic PVL. When infants are unresponsive to medical management for NEC, exploratory laparotomy with resection of the necrotic or perforated intestine is indicated. However, infants treated surgically have poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes than those with medical therapy. Pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental impairment in preterm infants undergoing surgery involves dysfunctional cerebrovascular autoregulation (CAR), which is associated with harmful changes in cerebral perfusion that lead to neuronal injury. Ill preterm infants, such as those with NEC, cannot regulate cerebral perfusion appropriately, and impaired CAR may be present in more than half the preterm infants during laparotomy. Impaired CAR leads to poor cerebral perfusion that potentiates neuronal injury, such as PVL. This case also brings awareness to the need for adherence to screening practices for white matter injury in critical NICU patients through cost-effective transcranial ultrasound."

The abdominal tomography noticed signs of occlusion of the small bowell and injury of 5cm at the pericaecal level. Urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed and objectified distal ileum attached to the cecum with signs of irreversible ischemia, so an ileocaecal resection was performed with ileo-colonic anastomosis. In the postoperative period she presented paralytic ileus and paraneoplastic syndrome with bicytopenia refractory to corticosteroid treatment. To rule out abdominal complications, abdominal tomography was performed on the 5th day post-op that confirmed the integrity of the anastomosis and absence of signs of mechanical occlusion. The patient's evolution was unfavorable, went on to exitus on the 14th day. The anatomopathological study diagnosed metastasis of malignant Phyllodes Tumor at the ileal level."

However, certain manipulations performed during the LAAC procedure, such as transseptal puncture (TSP), may potentially result in vessel injury and lead to cardiac tamponade or even fatality. Clinical significance and management strategies associated with these complications remain controversial. A 74-year-old female patient with atrial fibrillation was referred for left atrial appendage occlusion. During the puncture of the atrial septum, the catheter sheath inadvertently exited through the roof of the right atrium and continued to advance, resulting in pulmonary artery perforation. The patient underwent immediate pericardiocentesis and drainage, followed by surgical exploration for suturing the tear in the pulmonary artery and ligation of the left atrial appendage. This represents the first reported case of a pulmonary artery perforation occurring during a transseptal puncture procedure for left atrial appendage closure. The case exemplifies the feasibility of emergency cardiac surgery as a therapeutic intervention."

We highlight the potential utility of non-contrast CT for detection of aortic dissection in a case of a young, immunocompromised man presenting with acute abdominal pain and renal injury. Given elevated creatinine, an initial non-contrast chest CT demonstrated subtle findings suggestive of aortic dissection (aneurysmal dilation of the proximal ascending aorta as well as displaced calcified intimal flap/intraluminal high linear density in the thoracic descending and distal abdominal aorta). Subsequent CT angiography confirmed the presence of an extensive type A aortic dissection. He underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and hemiarch repair. Displaced calcified intimal flaps, intraluminal high-densities, intramural hematoma, and aneurysmal aortic dilation are common non-contrast computed tomography imaging findings that suggest aortic dissection."

    "abstract": "The optimal time to initiate venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis (VTEp) after blunt solid organ injury remains controversial, as VTE mitigation must be balanced against bleeding promulgation. Evidence from primarily small, retrospective, single-center work suggests that VTEp ≤48 hours is safe and effective. This study was undertaken to validate this clinical practice. Blunt trauma patients presenting to 19 participating trauma centers in North America were screened over a 1-year study period beginning between August 1 and October 1, 2021. Inclusions were age older than 15 years; ≥1 liver, spleen, or kidney injury; and initial nonoperative management. Exclusions were transfers, emergency department death, pregnancy, and concomitant bleeding disorder/anticoagulation/antiplatelet medication. A priori power calculation stipulated the need for 1,158 patients. Time of VTEp initiation defined study groups: Early (≤48 hours of admission) versus Late (>48 hours). Bivariate and multivariable analyses compared outcomes. In total, 1,173 patients satisfied the study criteria with 571 liver (49%), 557 spleen (47%), and 277 kidney injuries (24%). The median patient age was 34 years (interquartile range, 25-49 years), and 67% (n = 780) were male. The median Injury Severity Score was 22 (interquartile range, 14-29) with Abbreviated Injury Scale Abdomen score of 3 (interquartile range, 2-3), and the median American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade of solid organ injury was 2 (interquartile range, 2-3). Early VTEp patients (n = 838 [74%]) had significantly lower rates of VTE (n = 28 [3%] vs. n = 21 [7%], p = 0.008), comparable rates of nonoperative management failure (n = 21 [3%] vs. n = 12 [4%], p = 0.228), and lower rates of post-VTEp blood transfusion (n = 145 [17%] vs. n = 71 [23%], p = 0.024) when compared with Late VTEp patients (n = 301 [26%]). Late VTEp was independently associated with VTE (odd ratio, 2.251; p = 0.046). Early initiation of VTEp was associated with significantly reduced rates of VTE with no increase in bleeding complications. Venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis initiation ≤48 hours is therefore safe and effective and should be the standard of care for patients with blunt solid organ injury.

In this article, we report an atypical presentation of this syndrome, with the development of laminar tricuspid regurgitation after pericardial drainage. To our knowledge, this complication has never been reported in the medical literature. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition is based entirely on case reports. And because clinical studies are difficult to perform, the best defense against PDS is early detection so that it can be recognized and treated quickly."

    "abstract": "Midline exploratory laparotomy is essential in emergency surgery, and effective closure of the abdominal wall is crucial for optimal healing and reduced complications. The far-near-near-far technique for rectus sheath closure has gained attention due to potential advantages over conventional closure due to the fact that even if one suture gives way it does not affect the nearby suture and the rectus sheath is still held in place. This study aims to compare these techniques in emergency exploratory laparotomy. This single-center prospective observational study included all patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy at a tertiary care hospital. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the closure technique used: conventional closure or far-near-near-far technique. Sociodemographic data and comorbidities were collected. Operative time, closure time, and postoperative complications were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The study included patients with a mean age of 42.14 years. Operative and closure times did not significantly differ between the groups. There was no significant difference in comorbidities between the two techniques. The incidence of wound infection, dehiscence, burst abdomen, incisional hernia, and sinus formation did not significantly differ between the groups. Late complications were also similar. The far-near-near-far technique for rectus sheath closure in emergency exploratory laparotomy showed comparable outcomes to conventional closure methods. No significant differences were found in operative time, closure time, or postoperative complications. This study contributes to the understanding of different closure techniques, allowing surgeons to make informed decisions."

To better understand the shift to an aging population in the United States, identifying how age may influence these complications in older patients is important. The current standard age category for older adult patients is ≥65. We analyzed postlaparotomy complications using a lower age split. A retrospective analysis was done on patients who required an EEL from October 2015 to December 2019 at an academic medical center. Patient demographics and hospital course variables were collected. Differences in complications in patients aged ≥/<55 y and ≥/<65 y were measured using univariate and multivariable analyses. A total of 481 patients were reviewed. Both patient groups of ≥55 and ≥65 were typically male, White, had 3+ comorbidities, Medicare insurance, were retired, and presented in extremis to the emergency department. Patients aged ≥55 y had significant rates of pulmonary complications and inpatient mortality (odds ratio 2.2, 2.7, respectively). Patients aged ≥65 y had significant rates of genitourinary and cardiac complications (odds ratio 2.3, 1.8, respectively). Patients aged ≥55 y undergoing EEL had higher odds of experiencing pulmonary complications and death during their index hospitalizations, which was not present with the standard ≥/<65-y-old patient analysis. Those aged ≥65 y experienced index genitourinary and cardiac complications. The ≥/<55 age split has a unique set of complications that should be considered. Given the increased odds of inpatient mortality and types of complications in patients aged ≥55 y, the current age split for older adults should be reconsidered."

Ultrasound improved the recognition of cardiac tamponade and therefore has a vital role in acute critical situations in the Emergency Department and in the Intensive Care Unit. Besides recognition of cardiac tamponade, treatment protocols are important. In trauma patients with hemodynamic stable cardiac tamponade, time should be taken for a proper workup for an explorative sternotomy. In hemodynamic unstable trauma patients, the pericardium should be drained, and fluid resuscitation should be performed followed by emergency sternotomy. In this case report we describe a blunt thoracic trauma victim, a 28-year-old male patient without any medical history. He suffered from the unique combination of a tear in the left atrial appendage and a papillary muscle rupture of the right ventricle because of blunt thoracic trauma. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion with diastolic collapse of the right ventricle in our patient. Due to his hemodynamic situation, the patient was brought into the OR for immediate sternotomy and cardiac repair. The patient made a full recovery, was discharged home, and is back to work.

In cases where complications occur, such as intestinal perforation, it may present as an acute abdomen with diagnostic challenges regarding the etiology. A 70-year-old male was brought to the emergency department (ED) after he jumped from the second floor of a burning building, sustaining 10% second-degree burns to his forearms. He was intubated for concerns of inhalational injury and resuscitated. His intensive care unit (ICU) course included the management of respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. On hospital day 28, imaging showed moderate pneumoperitoneum with ascites. He was taken for abdominal exploration, during which it was noted that there was gross fecal contamination and a 1 cm cecal perforation. After resection of the ileocecum, it was left in discontinuity due to hemodynamic instability and contamination. He was brought for a second-look laparotomy in 48 hours, and an incisor tooth was found in the right pelvis, and an ileocolic (ileum-ascending colon) anastomosis was performed. His post-operative course was complicated by an anastomotic leak and an intra-abdominal collection. Despite attempts at source control with percutaneous drainage, the patient remained septic with a poor prognosis. Goals of care were discussed, and the decision was made to de-escalate care. Although there is literature on foreign body ingestion resulting in intestinal perforation, there is a paucity of literature highlighting the importance of dental exams in elderly trauma patients, the incidence of perforation due to tooth ingestion, and maintaining a high index of suspicion for an acute abdomen in unusual presentations of sepsis."

Exclusions were severe associated injuries (extracranial AIS > 2); transfers; and missing data. Patients were defined by in-hospital mortality: Survivors vs. Mortalities. Demographics, clinical/injury data, and the outcomes were collected and compared with univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis established independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality following mild TBI. In total, 932,107 patients (10% of NTDB population) met study criteria: 928,542 (99.6%) Survivors and 3,565 (0.4%) Mortalities. In general, comorbidities (including home anticoagulation, cardiac disease, and diabetes mellitus) were significantly more common among patients who died (p < 0.001), although drug and alcohol intoxication on arrival were more common among Survivors (16% vs. 7%, p < 0.001; 13% vs. 10%, p < 0.001). In terms of insurance status, Private/Commercial insurance was more common among Survivors (39% vs. 20%, p < 0.001) while Governmental Insurance was more common among Mortalities (55% vs. 36%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, age ≥ 65 was most strongly associated with death (OR 26.43, p < 0.001), followed by ED intubation (OR 10.08, p < 0.001), admission hypotension (OR 4.55, p < 0.001), and comorbidities, particularly end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (OR 3.03, p < 0.001) and immunosuppression (OR 2.18, p < 0.001). Survivors differed substantially from Mortalities after mild TBI in terms of comorbidities, intoxicants, and insurance status. Independent variables most strongly associated with in-hospital death following mild head injury included age ≥ 65, intubation in the ED, admission hypotension, and comorbidities (particularly ESRD and immunosuppression). Increased clinical vigilance, including a mandatory period of clinical observation, for patients with these risk factors should be considered to optimize outcomes and potentially mitigate death after mild TBI."

Patients with ICA pseudoaneurysms may present with cerebral ischemia, cervical masses, neck swelling, hematoma, rupture, pain, or cranial nerve dysfunction. We present a case of a left ICA pseudoaneurysm that developed in a 7-month-old infant because of a fall from height. The patient developed left-sided neck swelling that caused severe airway obstruction and respiratory arrest. The patient was urgently intubated and underwent emergency surgery under general anesthesia to repair the defect in the left ICA. Primary repair was performed to treat the pseudoaneurysms. The pseudoaneurysm sac was not removed because it was complicated and had extended into the respiratory tract. The patient was extubated on the 2nd day and discharged on the 7th day without complications. Follow-up of the patient after two weeks was unremarkable. Extracranial ICA pseudoaneurysms should be identified in patients presenting with blunt trauma. Emergency surgery should be considered for patients with progressive pseudoaneurysms."

    "abstract": "Clinical decision tools have been shown to reduce imaging rates for clearance of suspected cervical spine injury (CSI). This review provides more comprehensive evidence on the diagnostic capabilities of National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) and Canadian C-spine rule (CCR) in this regard. A systematic review of the current literature was performed on studies published until Jan 26th, 2023, in databases of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, investigating the performance of NEXUS and CCR in blunt trauma patients. QUADAS-2 and GRADE guidelines were used to assess the quality and certainty of evidence. All analyses were performed using the STATA 14.0 statistical analysis software. 35 articles comprising 70000 patients for NEXUS and 33000 patients for CCR were included in this review. NEXUS and CCR were evaluated to have a sensitivity of 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88 to 0.98) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98 to 1.00) in the detection of any CSI and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89 to 0.98) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.00) in the detection of clinically important CSI. The area under the curve (AUC) of NEXUS and CCR was 0.85 and 0.97 for any CSI and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74 to 0.81) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.96) for clinically important CSI. Our study demonstrates that both NEXUS and CCR can be used in ruling out patients with low risk of CSI, and CCR was shown to have superior performance. Even though these tools have low specificity, their application can still greatly reduce the number of radiographic imaging performed in emergency departments."

    "abstract": "The necessity of angioembolization for all splenic pseudoaneurysms (PSAs) is unknown after blunt trauma. We compared the outcomes of patients with PSAs managed with splenic artery embolization (EMBO) versus no embolization (NO-EMBO). We retrospectively reviewed all patients with blunt splenic trauma and PSA on initial computed tomography scan admitted to an academic, urban, Level I trauma center from 2016 to 2021. Patients who had emergent splenectomy or died before discharge were excluded. Demographics, injury and computed tomography characteristics, and details regarding angiography, if pursued, were collected. The primary outcome was failure of nonoperative management (FNOM), as defined by need for delayed splenectomy for the EMBO group versus delayed splenectomy or embolization for the NO-EMBO group. One hundred and fifty-six patients were in the final study population, of which 96 (61.5%) were in the EMBO group and 60 (38.5%) were in the NO-EMBO group. Patient demographics and mechanism of injury were similar between the two cohorts. The two cohorts had similar imaging findings, however, EMBO patients had more compartments with hemoperitoneum (2 versus 1, P < 0.01). Patients who underwent embolization had a lower FNOM rate (3.1% versus 13.3%, P = 0.02). Splenic artery embolization in the setting of PSA is associated with lower rates of FNOM versus nonembolization. It is unclear if addressing the PSA itself with embolization drives the decreased FNOM rate."

    "abstract": "Emergency Resuscitative Thoracotomy (ERT) is a lifesaving procedure in selected patients. Outcome mostly in blunt trauma is believed to be poor. The primary aim of this study was to determine the predictors of postoperative mortality following ERT. We retrospectively reviewed 34 patients ≥ 18 years who underwent ERT at San Camillo-Forlanini Hospital (Rome, Italy) between January 2009 and December 2022 with traumatic arrest for blunt or penetrating injuries. Of 34 ERT, 28 (82.4%) were for blunt trauma and 6 (17.6%) were for penetrating trauma. Injury Severity Score (p-value 0.014), positive E-FAST (p-value 0.023), Systolic Blood Pressure (p-value 0.001), lactate arterial blood (p-value 0.012), pH arterial blood (p-value 0.007), and bicarbonate arterial blood (p-value < 0.001) were significantly associated with postoperative mortality in a univariate model. After adjustment, the only independent predictor of postoperative mortality was Injury Severity Score (p-value 0.048). Our experience suggests that ERT is a technique that should be utilized for patients with critical penetrating injuries and blunt trauma in patients in extremis. Our study highlights as negative prognostic factors high values of ISS and lactate arterial blood, a positive E-FAST, and low values of Systolic Blood Pressure, pH arterial blood and bicarbonate arterial blood."

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is increasingly used to restore rhythm in patients with AF and flutter. The serious procedural complication rate has significantly reduced over time and most patients undergo PVI without any adverse events. We present the case of a 70-year-old man with symptomatic AF who underwent elective PVI that was complicated by large pericardial effusion from left atrial appendage (LAA) perforation resulting in cardiac tamponade requiring emergency pericardiocentesis followed by sternotomy to suture the LAA. The perforated LAA was sutured and the LAA was closed surgically through sternotomy by using AtriClip and a large amount of blood was evacuated achieving good cardiac output and hemodynamic stability. A surgical PVI was performed twice restoring normal sinus rhythm. The patient was discharged home, however, he returned to the hospital a few days later with atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response. He underwent direct current cardioversion (DCCV) and remained in sinus rhythm during the rest of his admission. His bisoprolol was switched to Sotalol to maintain normal sinus rhythm and he was discharged home with outpatient follow-up."

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess the change in cervical spine (C-spine) immobilization frequency in trauma patients over time. We hypothesize that the frequency of unnecessary C-spine immobilization has decreased. A retrospective chart review of adult trauma patients transported to our American College of Surgeons-verified Level I trauma center from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2021, was performed. Emergency medical services documentation was manually reviewed to record prehospital physiology and the application of a prehospital cervical collar (c-collar). C-spine injuries were defined as cervical vertebral fractures and/or spinal cord injuries. Univariate and year-by-year trend analyses were used to assess changes in C-spine injury and immobilization frequency. Among 2906 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 12% sustained C-spine injuries, while 88% did not. Patients with C-spine injuries were more likely to experience blunt trauma (95% vs. 68%, p < 0.001), were older (46 years vs. 41 years, p < 0.001), and had higher Injury Severity Scores (31 vs. 18, p < 0.001). They also exhibited lower initial systolic blood pressures (108 mm Hg vs. 119 mm Hg, p < 0.001), lower heart rates (92 beats/min vs. 97 beats/min, p < 0.05), and lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (9 vs. 11, p < 0.001). In blunt trauma, c-collars were applied to 83% of patients with C-spine injuries and 75% without; for penetrating trauma, c-collars were applied to 50% of patients with C-spine injuries and only 8% without. Among penetrating trauma patients with C-spine injury, all patients either arrived quadriplegic or did not require emergent neurosurgical intervention. The proportion of patients receiving a c-collar decreased in both blunt and penetrating traumas from 2014 to 2021 (blunt-82% in 2014 to 68% in 2021; penetrating-24% in 2014 to 6% in 2021). Unnecessary C-spine stabilization has decreased from 2014 to 2021. However, c-collars are still being applied to patients who do not need them, both in blunt and in penetrating trauma cases, while not being applied to patients who would benefit from them."

To determine the effectiveness of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) when used in the emergency department along with standard care vs standard care alone on mortality in trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage. Pragmatic, bayesian, randomized clinical trial conducted at 16 major trauma centers in the UK. Patients aged 16 years or older with exsanguinating hemorrhage were enrolled between October 2017 and March 2022 and followed up for 90 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 allocation) to a strategy that included REBOA and standard care (n = 46) or standard care alone (n = 44). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Ten secondary outcomes included mortality at 6 months, while in the hospital, and within 24 hours, 6 hours, or 3 hours; the need for definitive hemorrhage control procedures; time to commencement of definitive hemorrhage control procedures; complications; length of stay; blood product use; and cause of death. Of the 90 patients (median age, 41 years [IQR, 31-59 years]; 62 [69%] were male; and the median Injury Severity Score was 41 [IQR, 29-50]) randomized, 89 were included in the primary outcome analysis because 1 patient in the standard care alone group declined to provide consent for continued participation and data collection 4 days after enrollment. At 90 days, 25 of 46 patients (54%) had experienced all-cause mortality in the REBOA and standard care group vs 18 of 43 patients (42%) in the standard care alone group (odds ratio [OR], 1.58 [95% credible interval, 0.72-3.52]; posterior probability of an OR >1 [indicating increased odds of death with REBOA], 86.9%). Among the 10 secondary outcomes, the ORs for mortality and the posterior probabilities of an OR greater than 1 for 6-month, in-hospital, and 24-, 6-, or 3-hour mortality were all increased in the REBOA and standard care group, and the ORs were increased with earlier mortality end points. There were more deaths due to bleeding in the REBOA and standard care group (8 of 25 patients [32%]) than in standard care alone group (3 of 18 patients [17%]), and most occurred within 24 hours. In trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage, a strategy of REBOA and standard care in the emergency department does not reduce, and may increase, mortality compared with standard care alone. isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN16184981."

The patient developed acute cardiac tamponade on postoperative day 2, and symptoms resolved after pericardiocentesis. However, 20 h later, the patient underwent emergency surgery for re-developed acute cardiac tamponade, which was found to be a coronary tear. A review of the literature suggested that cardiac tamponade is more common in left lung surgery than right lung surgery. Pericardiocentesis can resolve initial acute cardiac tamponade, but pericardiotomy may be urgently needed after recurrence."

Packaged Food and Drug Administration-approved 0.05% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) irrigation solution reduces SSI rates in nonemergency settings. We hypothesize that the use of 0.05% CHG irrigation solution prior to closure of emergent EL incisions will be associated with lower rates of superficial SSI and allows for increased rates of primary skin closure. A retrospective observational study of all emergent EL whose subcutaneous tissue were irrigated with 0.05% CHG solution to achieve primary wound closure from March 2021 to June 2022 were performed. Patients with active soft-tissue infection of the abdominal wall were excluded. Our primary outcome is rate of primary skin closure following laparotomy. Descriptive statistics, including t-test and chi-square test, were used to compare groups as appropriate. A P value <0.05 was statistically significant. Sixty-six patients with a median age of 51 y (18-92 y) underwent emergent EL. Primary wound closure is achieved in 98.5% of patients (65/66). Bedside removal of some staples and conversion to wet-to-dry packing changes was required in 27.3% of patients (18/66). We found that most of these were due to fat necrosis. We report no cases of fascial dehiscence. In patients undergoing EL, intraoperative irrigation of the subcutaneous tissue with 0.05% CHG solution is a viable option for primary skin closure. Further studies are needed to prospectively evaluate our findings."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, invasive fungal infections have been on the rise, likely due to a combination of factors such as immunosuppression, underlying conditions like diabetes, and surgical procedures. Herein, we report a 67-year-old diabetic woman with a history of COVID-19 infection who received a high dose of corticosteroids a few months before admission, and previous myocardial infarction for more than 12 years. The patient had a positive cardiac tamponade with signs of dyspnea, chest pain, and low blood pressure. Echocardiographic data were more in favor of constrictive pericarditis. The patient underwent urgent echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis and then broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was prescribed. Repeated echocardiography implied a persistent pericardial effusion 10 days later. Subxiphoid aspirates and biopsied tissues showed budding yeast cells and yeast colonies grew on culture media identified as Candida albicans. This report should bring to the attention of physicians toward the possibility of Candida pericardial infection presenting with cardiac tamponade after COVID-19 infection and cardiothoracic surgery.

    "abstract": "Ascending aortic dissection is typically characterized by severe chest or back pain. However, its presentation can be atypical, leading to diagnostic challenges, especially in settings where classic symptomatology may not be evident. In this report, we described the case of a 74-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room of a rural community hospital with chief complaints of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, without the classic symptoms of chest or back pain associated with aortic dissection. Despite initial treatment for autonomic dysregulation, the patient's symptoms persisted. Subsequent comprehensive assessments, including computed tomography angiography, revealed an ascending aortic dissection extending to the bilateral common carotid arteries. This atypical presentation, characterized by cerebral hypoperfusion and systemic hypotension without tachycardia, emphasizes the need to maintain a high suspicion index, even in the absence of hallmark symptoms. This case underscores the importance of considering the possibility of ascending aortic dissection in patients with nontraditional symptoms. Recognizing these atypical presentations is crucial for timely intervention, especially in rural settings with limited advanced diagnostic tools. This case also highlights potential sex disparities in symptom presentation, emphasizing the need for clinicians to recognize nontraditional symptoms in women. Rapid identification, evaluation, and management are imperative to prevent severe outcomes, and a multidisciplinary approach has proven to be the most effective in such cases."

    "abstract": "A 6-month-old, intact female, French bulldog was presented to the Emergency Department for evaluation of vomiting and diarrhea over the preceding week which had not responded to supportive medical therapy. Imaging studies identified an incarcerated para-esophageal hernia with peritoneal effusion and gas consistent with gastrointestinal perforation. Following stabilization, the dog underwent an exploratory laparotomy which confirmed an incarcerated hiatal hernia and gastric perforation. A gastrectomy was performed to repair the defect, and to prevent recurrence both a herniorrhaphy and esophagopexy were performed. Post-operative care required treatment for septic shock including vasopressor and hydrocortisone infusions and plasma transfusions for colloidal support. The patient was successfully discharged 4 days after surgery. The histopathology results identified spiral bacteria consistent with Helicobacter spp. which was subsequently treated with oral antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. The dog has had no further gastrointestinal signs in the 90 days since surgery. Gastric perforation and peritonitis can occur secondary to an incarcerated esophageal hiatal hernia, and if treated promptly can result in a successful outcome. This case demonstrates a novel etiology of gastric perforation which may be associated with brachycephalic breeds. Une femelle bouledogue français intacte de 6 mois a été présentée au service des urgences pour une évaluation des vomissements et de la diarrhée au cours de la semaine précédente qui n’avaient pas répondu à un traitement médical de soutien. Les études par imagerie ont identifié une hernie para-œsophagienne incarcérée avec un épanchement péritonéal et des gaz compatibles avec une perforation gastro-intestinale. Après stabilisation, la chienne a subi une laparotomie exploratoire qui a confirmé une hernie hiatale incarcérée et une perforation gastrique. Une gastrectomie a été réalisée pour réparer le défaut et pour prévenir les récidives, une herniorraphie et une œsophagopexie ont été réalisées. Les soins postopératoires ont nécessité un traitement pour choc septique comprenant des perfusions de vasopresseurs et d’hydrocortisone et des transfusions de plasma pour le soutien colloïdal. La patiente a obtenu son congé avec succès 4 jours après la chirurgie. Les résultats d’histopathologie ont identifié des bactéries en spirale compatibles avec Helicobacter spp. qui a ensuite été traité avec des antibiotiques oraux et un inhibiteur de la pompe à protons. La chienne n’a plus eu de signes gastro-intestinaux dans les 90 jours qui ont suivi la chirurgie.Une perforation gastrique et une péritonite peuvent survenir à la suite d’une hernie hiatale oesophagienne incarcérée et, si elles sont traitées rapidement, peuvent donner un résultat positif.

A secondary analysis was performed of the Pragmatic, Randomized, Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) trial data (N = 680). All patients included were predicted to require massive transfusion and admitted to one of 12 North American trauma centers. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patients, including demographics, type and mechanism of injury, source of bleeding, and receipt of prehospital interventions. Patient time to definitive care was determined using the time from activation of emergency services to responder arrival on scene, and time from scene departure to emergency department (ED) arrival. Each interval was calculated and then summed for a total time to definitive care. Patients were primarily white (63.8%), male (80.3%), with a median age of 34 (IQR 24-51) years. Roughly one-half of patients experienced blunt (49.0%) versus penetrating (48.2%) injury. The most common types of blunt trauma were motor vehicle injuries (83.5%), followed by falls (9.3%), other (3.6%), assaults (1.8%), and incidents due to machinery (1.8%). The most common types of penetrating injuries were gunshot wounds (72.3%), stabbings (24.1%), other (2.1%), and impalements (1.5%). One-third of patients (34.5%) required some prehospital intervention, including intubation (77.4%), chest or needle decompression (18.8%), tourniquet (18.4%), and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; 5.6%). Sources of bleeding included the abdomen (44.3%), chest (20.4%), limb/extremity (18.2%), pelvis (11.4%), and other (5.7%). Patients waited for a median of six (IQR4-10) minutes for emergency responders to arrive at the scene of injury and traveled a median of 27 (IQR 19-42) minutes to an ED. Time to definitive care was a median of 57 (IQR 44-77) minutes, with a range of 12-232 minutes. Twenty-four-hour mortality was 15% (n = 100) with 81 patients dying due to exsanguination or hemorrhage. Patients who experience critical injury may experience lengthy times to receipt of definitive care and may benefit from bystander action for hemorrhage control to improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Uterine leiomyomas, or fibroids, are the most common benign tumours of the female genital tract. Although uterine fibroids are commonly associated with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, symptomatic anaemia, urinary or bowel symptoms and infertility, intra-abdominal haemorrhage is an exceedingly rare complication. Often, the diagnosis is poorly recognizable based on the patient's clinical presentation and alternative diagnoses such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst or perforated viscus are frequently considered. Herein, we describe a case of a 50-year-old perimenopausal woman who presented with acute, lower abdominal pain, evolving anaemia, hypovolaemic shock and haemoperitoneum with no discernable source. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed the source of massive haemoperitoneum arising from a ruptured blood vessel supplying a large subserosal uterine leiomyoma and the patient subsequently underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Given the paucity of publications on this clinical entity, the aim of this report is to highlight a rare complication of uterine leiomyomas, its pathophysiological spectrum and its relevance to emergency physicians, general surgeons and gynaecologists."

    "abstract": "The spleen is one of the most injured organs following blunt abdominal trauma. The management options can be either operative or non-operative management (NOM) with either conservative management or splenic artery embolization. The implementation of CT in emergency departments allowed the use of CT imaging as a primary screening tool in early decision-making. Consecutively, new splenic injury scoring systems, such as the CT severity index (CTSI) reported was established. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the implementation of CTSI scoring system on the management decision and outcomes in patients with blunt splenic trauma over 8 years in a level 1 trauma center. This is a retrospective study including all adult patients with primary splenic trauma, having NOM and admitted to our hospital between 2013 and 2021. The analyses were conducted on ninety-nine patients. The average sample age was 32.7 ± 12.3 years old. A total of (63/99) patients had splenic parenchyma injury without splenic vascular injury. There is a statistically significant association between CTSI grade 3 injury and the development of delayed splenic vascular injury (p < 0.05). There is an association between severity of initial CTSI score and the risk of NOM/clinical failure (p = 0.02). Our findings suggest implementing such a system in a level 1 trauma center will further improve the outcome of treatment for splenic blunt trauma. However, CTSI grade 3 is considered an increased risk of NOM failure, and further investigations are necessary to standardize its management."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Giant bullae rupture easily and cause tension pneumothorax, which can cause problems during general anesthesia. However, the hemodynamic instability that can occur due to the mass effect of an unruptured giant bulla should not be overlooked. Case report: A 43-year-old male patient visited the emergency room with an abdominal wound. There was a giant emphysematous bulla in the left lung. Emergency surgery was decided upon because there was active bleeding according to abdominal CT. After tracheal intubation, the patient's blood pressure and pulse rate dramatically decreased. His blood pressure did not recover despite the use of vasopressors and discontinuation of positive pressure ventilation applied to the lungs. Thus, a bullectomy was immediately performed. The patient's blood pressure and pulse rate were normalized after the bullectomy. Conclusions: If emergency surgery under general anesthesia is required in a patient with a giant emphysematous bulla, it is safe to minimize positive pressure ventilation and remove the giant emphysematous bulla as soon as possible before proceeding with the remainder of the surgery. Tension pneumothorax due to the rupturing of a bulla should be considered first. However, hemodynamic changes might occur due to the mass effect caused by a giant bulla."

    "title": "Unexpected Tension Pneumothorax Developed during Anesthetic Induction Aggravated by Positive Pressure Ventilation: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency condition that requires immediate diagnosis and intervention. However, due to the non-specific symptoms and the rarity of its occurrence during surgery, anesthesiologists encounter difficulties in promptly diagnosing tension pneumothorax when it arises intraoperatively. Diagnosing tension pneumothorax can become even more challenging in unexpected situations in patients with normal preoperative evaluation for general anesthesia. Materials and Methods, Results: We report the case of a 66-year-old woman who underwent general anesthesia for oblique lateral interbody fusion surgery of her lumbar spine. Though she did not have any respiratory symptoms prior to the induction of anesthesia, auscultation following endotracheal intubation indicated decreased breathing sound in the left hemithorax of the chest. Subsequently, her vital signs showed tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia, and the ventilator indicated a gradual increase in the airway pressure. We verified the proper depth of the endotracheal tube to exclude one-lung ventilation, and, in the meantime, learned that there had been unsuccessful attempts at left subclavian venous catheterization by the surgical department on the previous day. Tension pneumothorax was diagnosed through portable chest radiography in the operating room, and needle thoracostomy and chest tube insertion were performed immediately, which in turn stabilized her vital signs and airway pressure. The surgery was uneventful, and the chest tube was removed one week later after evaluation by the cardiothoracic department. The patient was discharged from hospital on postoperative day 14 without known complications. Conclusions: Anesthesiologists should be aware of the conditions and risk factors that may cause tension pneumothorax and remain vigilant for signs of its development throughout surgery, even for patients who show normal preoperative assessments. An undetected small pneumothorax without any symptoms can progress to tension pneumothorax through positive pressure ventilation during general anesthesia, posing a life-threatening situation. If a tension pneumothorax is highly suspected through clinical assessments, its prompt differentiation and timely diagnosis are crucial, allowing for rapid intervention to stabilize vital signs."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous hemoperitoneum during pregnancy, caused by rupture of uterine vessels, is a rare and dangerous complication that can lead to maternal and foetal death. We presented a case of a 25-year-old primigravid woman with severe abdominal pain, distension, and hemodynamic instability at 33 weeks of gestation. An ultrasound and computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed intraperitoneal fluid collection with a non-viable intrauterine pregnancy. Following this, we did an emergency exploratory laparotomy with suturing the ruptured uterine vessel and delivered a freshly dead fetus. This case highlighted the rare occurrence of spontaneous hemoperitoneum due to rupture of the uterine vessel during pregnancy and the need for urgent intervention to avoid complications."

    "abstract": "Emphysematous gastritis is a severe form of gastritis caused by gas-forming infectious organisms and is most frequently encountered in critically unwell patients. Diagnosis rests on the radiographic appearances of air within the gastric wall, which may extend into the portal venous system. Not previously described in the context of neutropenic sepsis, our case involves a 77-year-old patient with emphysematous gastritis who was admitted to the intensive care unit with a neutrophil count of 0.1 × 109/L and managed successfully with conservative treatment. Presenting complaints usually include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and occasionally haematemesis, in the context of systemic upset. Predisposing factors may include diabetes and immunosuppression, ingestion of corrosive substances, alcohol abuse, and abdominal surgery. The historical approach to management which previously involved urgent exploratory laparotomy with gastrectomy, has largely been replaced with conservative therapy, including broad-spectrum antimicrobials, gut rest and parenteral nutrition, with improved outcomes. Previously considered a commonly terminal diagnosis with mortality rates as high as 60%, this recent shift in approach to management has contributed to mortality rates being halved. The role of oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy has not been established and is unlikely to be indicated in every case. Longterm complications may be of concern and include fibrosis and gastric contractures."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Inherited deficiencies in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, result in Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder that is associated with aortic root dilatation and predisposes to aortic dissection. This report is of a 37-year-old woman presenting at 39 weeks of pregnancy with acute thoracic aortic dissection due to previously undiagnosed FBN1-related Marfan syndrome. This case report aims to illustrate the challenges in the diagnosis and in the peri-operative management of acute aortic dissection during pregnancy. CASE REPORT A healthy 37-year-old woman at 39 weeks of gestation presented to our hospital with dyspnea and chest pain. Initial evaluation for pulmonary embolism with chest computed tomography was unrevealing. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for further management. Overnight, her clinical conditions deteriorated, and a transthoracic echocardiography was obtained, demonstrating an acute ascending aortic dissection. She emergently underwent a successful combined cesarean section and ascending aortic dissection repair, with no immediate complications. On postoperative day 4 she developed cardiac tamponade, for which she underwent emergent mediastinal exploration. She was discharged home on postoperative day 10. A month later she completed genetic testing, which revealed a pathogenic mutation in the FBN1 gene, consistent with a molecular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. CONCLUSIONS This report has shown that FBN1-related Marfan's syndrome has a variable clinical presentation that can include life-threatening aortic dissection during pregnancy. Successful diagnosis and management of these patients is challenging and requires multidisciplinary expertise, including confirmation of the diagnosis by a clinical geneticist."

A 77-year-old woman was referred to our emergency department after blunt trauma in her right eye. At the ophthalmic evaluation, visual acuity was hand movement, biomicroscopy showed pseudoexfoliation syndrome and a traumatic lens luxation in the vitreous chamber. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy, subluxated cataract explantation, and FIL SSF IOL implant. During surgery, an inferior retinal detachment was encountered, requiring 20% SF6 gas tamponade. No adverse events were encountered. One month postoperatively, visual acuity (BCVA) improved to 0,3 logMAR. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient presented with BCVA of 0,5 logMAR, and biomicroscopy showed a minimal IOL opacification. Six months postoperatively, BCVA decreased to 1.0 logMAR, and diffuse, IOL opacification was noted at slit lamp examination. The patient refused any other surgical intervention for IOL exchange. Although hydrophilic IOL opacification gas related is known, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of FIL SSF IOL opacification after pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade for retinal detachment."

    "abstract": "The Battle of Mosul (2016-2017) was an urban conflict resulting in over 9000 civilian deaths. Emergency Management Centre (EMC), located 90 km from Mosul, was designated as a civilian-run trauma centre as part of the novel Mosul Trauma Pathway. Patients necessitating exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) provide a unique window into the system of care delivery in conflicts, given the importance of timely, resource-intensive care. However, there is insufficient knowledge regarding the presentation and outcomes for conflict-related ex-lap in civilian institutions. This is a descriptive study retrospectively analyzing routinely collected data for all patients who underwent ex-lap at EMC for injuries sustained during the battle of Mosul. Differences in demographics, pre-hospital/hospital course, and New Injury Severity Scores (NISS) were analysed using student t-test, Hotelling T-squared, and linear regression. During the battle, 1832 patients with conflict-related injuries were admitted to EMC. Some 73/1832 (4.0%) underwent ex-lap, of whom 22/73 (30.1%) were children and 40/73 (54.8%) were non-combatant adults. Men constituted 51/73 (69%) patients. Gunshot wounds caused 19/73 (26.0%) injuries, while ordnances caused 52/73 (71.2%). Information regarding hospital course was available for 47/73 (64.4%) patients. Children had prolonged time from injury to first laparotomy compared to adults (600 vs 208 min, p < 0.05). Median LOS was 6 days (IQR 4-9.5); however, 11/47 (23%) patients left against medical advice. Post-operative complications occurred in 11/47 (23.4%) patients; 6/11 (54.5%) were surgical site infections. There were 12 (25.5%) patients who underwent relaparotomies after index surgery elsewhere; 10/12 (83.3%) were for failed repairs or missed injuries. Median NISS was 18 (IQR 12-27). NISS were significantly higher for women (vs men; 28.5 vs 19.8), children (vs adults; 28.8 vs 20), and relaparotomy patients (vs primary laparotomy patients; 32.0 vs 19.0). Some 3 patients died, 2 of whom were relaparotomies. At this civilian tertiary trauma centre, conflict-related exploratory laparotomies were associated with low morbidity and mortality. Long transport times, high rates of repeat laparotomies, and high numbers of patients leaving against medical advice raise questions regarding continuity of care along the Mosul Trauma Pathway. The study protocol was registered at Clinicaltrails.gov, ID NCT03490305, prior to collection of data."

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of open cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OCPR) remains controversial for trauma patients. In this current study, the role of OCPR in managing chest trauma patients is evaluated using nationwide real-world data. From 2014 to 2015, the National Trauma Data Bank was retrospectively queried for chest trauma patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest status. The emergency department (ED) and overall survival of patients without signs of life were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to evaluate independent factors of mortality for the target group. Furthermore, a subset group of patients who survived after the ED were studied, focusing on the duration of survival after leaving the ED. A total of 911 patients were enrolled in this study (OCPR vs. non-OCPR: 161 patients vs. 750 patients). The average overall mortality rate was 98.6% (N = 898). Among penetrating chest trauma patients, non-survivors in the ED had significantly higher proportions of gunshot injuries (83.9% vs. 69.7%, p = 0.001) and lower proportions of OCPR (20.7% vs. 44.4%, p < 0.001). MLR analysis showed that gunshot injuries and non-OCPR were significantly related to ED mortality in penetrating trauma patients without signs of life (odds ratio = 2.039, p = 0.006 and odds ratio = 2.900, p < 0.001, respectively). However, the overall survival rate of patients after ED survival (n = 99) was 9.9%, and only 21.2% (n = 21) of them survived more than 1 day after leaving the ED. OCPR could be considered in situations where appropriate indications exist. The survival benefit was observed in critically ill patients with penetrating chest trauma who show no signs of life. By enhancing ED survival, OCPR may also contribute to overall survival improvement."

    "abstract": "Adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) represents a common surgical emergency leading to increased hospital admissions. Most patients presenting with adhesive SBO have a history of previous abdominal surgery. Although bowel obstruction secondary to congenital adhesion bands is rare, it should not be ruled out even in patients with a \"virgin abdomen\". We present two rare cases of adult patients with SBO due to congenital adhesions. The first patient was transferred to the operating room, secondary to a closed-loop obstruction diagnosis. Two congenital adhesion bands were detected intraoperatively, then coagulated and divided. The second patient was surgically treated due to worsening abdominal pain. An adhesive band was identified occluding the ileum on surgical exploration, then ligated and excised. Both patients recovered uneventfully, without any recurrence of symptoms on the follow-up. Single adhesive bands are more commonly found in cases with a \"virgin abdomen\". Meanwhile, solitary bands usually lead to bowel strangulation and ischemia, mostly mandating operative management. Interestingly, a computed tomography scan may confirm the diagnosis of bowel obstruction, whereas water-soluble contrast agents may help predict the need for surgical treatment. Besides exploratory laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery is gaining ground as an effective SBO diagnosis and management approach. Adhesive SBO due to congenital bands is a rare condition, particularly in adults, with potentially lifethreatening complications. With the aim of prompt diagnosis and treatment, a high index of suspicion and awareness should be maintained even in patients without previous medical or surgical history. Small bowel obstruction, Congenital adhesion bands, Virgin abdomen. L’ostruzione aderenziale dell’intestino tenue (SBO) rappresenta un’emergenza chirurgica comune che comporta ricoveri ospedalieri in aumento La maggior parte dei pazienti che presentano SBO aderenziale ha nella storia un precedente intervento chirurgico addominale. Sebbene l’ostruzione intestinale secondaria a briglie aderenziali congenite sia rara, non dovrebbe essere esclusa nemmeno nei pazienti con “addome vergine”. Presentiamo due rari casi di pazienti adulti con SBO dovuta ad aderenze congenite. Il primo paziente è stato trasferito in sala operatoria, in seguito a una diagnosi di ostruzione ad ansa chiusa. Due briglie aderenziali congenite sono state riconosciute all’intervento, e quindi coagulate e sezionate. Il secondo paziente è stato sottoposto a laparotomia esplorativa per un peggioramento del dolore addominale. All’esplorazione chirurgica è stata identificata una briglia adesiva che occludeva l’ileo, che è stata legata e asportata. Entrambi i pazienti si sono ripresi senza problemi, senza alcuna recidiva dei sintomi al follow-up. Nei con un “addome vergine” si trovano più comunemente singole briglie aderenziali. Queste di solito comportano per lo più uno strangolamento intestinale e a fenomeni ischemici, che richiedono un trattamento chirurgico. È interessante notare che una tomografia computerizzata può confermare la diagnosi di ostruzione intestinale, mentre i mezzi di contrasto idrosolubili possono aiutare a prevedere la necessità di un trattamento chirurgico. Oltre alla laparotomia esplorativa, la chirurgia laparoscopica sta guadagnando terreno come efficace approccio diagnostico e gestionale dell’SBO. SBO adesivo per briglie aderenziali congenite è una condizione rara, in particolare negli adulti, con complicazioni potenzialmente pericolose per la vita. Al fine di conseguire diagnosi e trattamento tempestivi, dovrebbe essere considerato un alto indice di sospetto, nella consapevolezza di tale evenienza. anche nei pazienti senza precedenti medici o chirurgici a livello addominale."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pericardial effusions are considered to be present when accumulated fluid within the pericardial sac exceeds the small amount that is normally present, causing impairment in the diastolic filling of the right heart. This case demonstrates an uncommon presentation of a large pericardial effusion by showing its relationship to myxedema in a patient with untreated hypothyroidism. CASE REPORT A 42-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and opioid abuse presented to the emergency department due to altered mental status, for which he received Narcan without resolution of symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was without any acute intracranial abnormalities to explain the patient's altered mental status. CT chest reported a pericardial effusion, with a subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing a moderate-to-large circumferential effusion without right atrial/ventricular collapse and no cardiac tamponade physiology. On further investigation, he was found to have severe hypothyroidism with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Endocrinology was consulted to start IV levothyroxine and liothyronine to treat autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Subsequent TTE after starting hypothyroidism treatment showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 45-50% with mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function and moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, with no evidence of tamponade physiology. After treatment of hypothyroidism, the thyroid panel, EF, and pericardial effusion improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates the potential for suffering a large pericardial effusion secondary to generalized myxedema in a patient with severe hypothyroidism from undiagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It is important to recognize this condition for appropriate therapy and prevention of worsening cardiac conditions."

The case presented here describes the emergency acute presentation of septic peritonitis discovered intraoperatively upon laparotomy. A middle-aged woman was admitted to the emergency department and presented with generalized colicky abdominal pain associated with repetitive vomiting, abdominal distention, and absolute constipation. A digital rectal examination revealed an empty rectum and a bilious output was observed in the nasogastric tube. Abdominal X-Ray demonstrated multiple air-fluid levels with no air under the diaphragm. The patient was treated with fluid therapy and antibiotics intravenously (IV). The clinical impression of acute-on-chronic intestinal obstruction with peritonitis and the possibility of bowel strangulation was made. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed viable bowel loops encased in thickened fibrous capsules covering the entire abdominal viscera establishing the existence of ISEP. The fibrous capsule layer was excised out in small pieces from all the abdominal organs excluding stomach through extensive adhesiolysis without loop resection. The emergency presentation of acute peritonitis observed in this study could only be identified through diagnostic laparoscopy and differential radiological imaging techniques. Further, better reporting of such rare cases may help clinicians understand the different clinical features that could indicate the occurrence of ISEP."

    "title": "Cardiac Tamponade Secondary to Hemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion: A Complication of STEMI.",
    "abstract": "Background: Most pericardial effusions that occur in the setting of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are small, simple, and without symptomology. However, in its most severe form, pericardial effusion can precipitate cardiac tamponade, and when untreated, can cause abrupt hemodynamic instability. Pericardial effusion may be a manifestation of left ventricular free-wall rupture, hemorrhagic pericarditis, or aortic dissection involving a coronary artery. Case Report: We describe the case of a 65-year-old male who experienced chest pain for several days prior to admission but delayed seeking care because he wished to avoid coronavirus disease 2019 exposure. Upon arrival, he was hemodynamically unstable. Electrocardiogram was consistent with anterior STEMI. Bedside echocardiogram demonstrated a hypertrophic left ventricle with preserved function and a large, complex pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology. Computed tomography of the chest identified hemopericardium but was unable to delineate etiology. The patient underwent emergent thoracotomy because of persistent shock, and during the surgery, left ventricular free-wall rupture was identified and repaired. Coronary artery bypass grafting to the patient's left anterior descending artery was also performed. The patient remained asymptomatic at 2-year follow-up. Conclusion: The differential for hemodynamic compromise in a patient with STEMI is broad, but quickly distinguishing pump failure from other life-threatening causes of shock is imperative to dictate time-sensitive management decisions. The presence of a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion in the setting of STEMI is a surrogate marker for a severe infarct and can help the bedside physician determine whether a patient will be better served in the catheterization lab for revascularization or in the operating room for surgical repair."

Interventional radiology paracentesis was performed, yielding a milky, purulent peritoneal fluid with no visible organisms and negative cultures. Antibiotics and paracentesis were insufficient in managing her condition, which continued to worsen over the course of several days. Given her continued deterioration despite clinical intervention, she underwent an exploratory laparotomy and peritoneal lavage along with continued broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cultures continued to be negative but operative findings included diffuse fibrinous peritonitis with no obvious abscess or perforated abdominal viscus.

Secondary injuries resulting from kinetic energy transfer in the case of gunshot wounds (GSWs), often referred to as \"blast injuries\", may affect tissues distant to the ballistic trajectory and are often occult. We present a case of delayed cardiac tamponade resulting from secondary blast injury. The patient sustained a thoraco-abdominal GSW with entry adjacent to the cardiac box. An Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)-guided assessment revealed intra-abdominal injuries necessitating operative intervention without evidence of cardiac injury. On post-operative day four, the patient developed chest pain, tachycardia, and shortness of breath. Imaging revealed a large pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. Emergent exploration revealed hemopericardium secondary to a bleeding epicardial hematoma without evidence of pericardial violation. Clinicians must maintain a high clinical suspicion for occult, indirect blast injuries which may be life-threatening."

    "title": "Jejunal Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor: A Strange Cause of Massive Gastrointestinal Bleeding.",
    "abstract": "Jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are rare mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and a rare cause of massive GI bleeding. Due to this rarity and non-specific presentation, diagnosis and treatment may be difficult and often delayed. Urgent surgical intervention is crucial for controlling the source of bleeding and total tumor excision. Herein, we present the case of a 40-year-old male who presented to the emergency room (ER) with features of upper GI bleeding. He referred astheny and black stools, and was pale, sweaty, and tachycardic despite normal blood pressure. Rectal examination revealed melena, and laboratory findings revealed decreased hemoglobin (Hb) and elevated blood urea. Upper endoscopy was normal, and the Hb level dropped again to 6.9 g/dL; therefore, blood transfusion was required during ER observation. For further investigation, the patient underwent an angio-computed tomography scan, which revealed a lesion located in a jejunal loop as the probable bleeding source. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a jejunal loop tumor. Segmental enterectomy containing the tumor was performed and the post-operative period was uneventful. The anatomopathological examination was compatible with low-risk GIST, and the multidisciplinary board agreed that surveillance was the best ongoing treatment. Due to the rarity of jejunal GIST as the cause of massive GI bleeding, diagnosis may be challenging, delaying prompt treatment with bleeding source control. In such cases, surgery may be both lifesaving and curative. Therefore, these tumors should not be forgotten when managing patients with occult GI bleeding with an atypical presentation to prevent delays in treatment and severe outcomes."

    "abstract": "Intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) is challenging due to its nonspecific clinical presentation, sometimes manifesting with acute complications such as intestinal perforation or obstruction. We present the case of a 39-year-old male presented with continuous fever, abdominal pain, and peritoneal irritation. A contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography revealed free air and fluid, suggestive of intestinal perforation. Urgent surgical treatment was performed via exploratory laparotomy, including right hemicolectomy and construction of a Brooke ileostomy. Histopathological analysis confirmed intestinal miliary tuberculosis. The most commonly affected areas in ITB are the ileocecal region and ileum. Symptoms include abdominal pain, weight loss, changes in bowel habits, and fever. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is crucial for diagnosis. The first-line treatment is medical with antituberculosis drugs. Due to its delayed diagnosis, ITB should be considered in patients with nonspecific and progressive symptoms. Early medical management is crucial to prevent acute complications associated with high morbidity and mortality."

    "abstract": "In patients who have undergone radical cystectomy, urinary diversion procedures such as ileal conduits may pose a considerable problem for urologists when they result in stone formation. While an ileal conduit stone is only one of many potential complications of this procedure, its management may be particularly challenging; symptoms and treatments vary depending on factors such as stone location, composition, and the patient's BMI. We present a unique case of a 91-year-old male with a history of prostate and bladder cancer status post-radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, and ileal conduit who presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and disorientation for the last 24 hours. The patient was diagnosed with a complete bowel obstruction secondary to gallstone ileus. Consequently, an exploratory laparotomy was performed, which revealed that his small bowel obstruction was not caused by gallstone ileus but rather secondary to an internal hernia and volvulus associated with a previous bowel resection and anastomosis. The stone that was originally thought to be causing the small bowel obstruction turned out to be a 3.3 cm stone in his ileal conduit, which ultimately had no part in causing the patient's small bowel obstruction. Calculus formation is an infrequent complication of ileal conduit placement. Our aim in presenting this case is to increase awareness of this rare complication that can arise without symptoms with the hopes of increasing early intervention and improving outcomes."

Typical symptoms include cough, chest pain, and dyspnea; however, cardiac tamponade as the primary manifestation is exceedingly rare. We hereby present a case of a 34-year-old male with a past medical history of obesity, who presented to our emergency department with a chronic dry cough for 4 months. On admission, computed tomography demonstrated a large 11.1-cm diameter anterior mediastinal mass, and echocardiography demonstrated cardiac tamponade physiology. The patient underwent further workup including pericardiocentesis, subsequent pericardial window, and mediastinal biopsy, which demonstrated histopathology consistent with PMBCL. Our case highlights the importance of a complete and thorough workup for patients with chronic untraditional symptoms. This case is unique in that PMBCL is rarely associated with cardiac tamponade as the primary clinical presentation. Additionally, we recommend an extensive cardiac workup for patients presenting with a large mediastinal mass, as failure to do so may result in patient morbidity and mortality."

The authors present a case report of a 65-year-old male patient with a blunt trauma to the left chest and abdomen, diagnosed with multiple left rib fractures, left hemothorax and splenic injury with a small subcapsular hematoma with no signs of active splenic bleeding. Due to hemodynamic instability and a large volume of blood loss via the chest drain, the patient was indicated for emergency left thoracotomy. A perforation in the lower lobe of the left lung caused by rib fractures was found, which was treated with sutures. Furthermore, the diaphragm was examined, two ruptures were identified from which blood was coming out, and thus a phrenotomy was performed. The bleeding central splenic rupture came as a big surprise. A spleen preserving surgery was impossible, therefore a splenectomy had to be performed, followed by chest wall stabilization with splints. Transthoracic approach to manage the splenic injury through phrenotomy should not be used as a standard. In a selected group of patients with concomitant chest and upper abdominal organ injuries, the use of this surgical approach appears to be highly beneficial. Key words: splenic injury, splenectomy, thoracotomy, rib fractures, diaphragmatic rupture."

    "abstract": "Sweden is facing a surge of gun violence that mandates optimized prehospital transport approaches, and a survey of current practice is fundamental for such optimization. Management of severe, penetrating trauma is time sensitive, and there may be a survival benefit in limiting prehospital interventions. An important aspect is unregulated transportation by police or private vehicles to the hospital, which may decrease time but may also be associated with adverse outcomes. It is not known whether transport of patients with penetrating trauma occurs outside the emergency medical services (EMS) in Sweden and whether it affects outcome. This was a retrospective, descriptive nationwide study of all patients with penetrating trauma and injury severity scores (ISSs) ≥ 15 registered in the Swedish national trauma registry (SweTrau) between June 13, 2011, and December 31, 2019. We hypothesized that transport by police and private vehicles occurred and that it affected mortality. A total of 657 patients were included. EMS transported 612 patients (93.2%), police 10 patients (1.5%), and private vehicles 27 patients (4.1%). Gunshot wounds (GSWs) were more common in police transport, 80% (n = 8), compared with private vehicles, 59% (n = 16), and EMS, 32% (n = 198). The Glasgow coma scale score (GCS) in the emergency department (ED) was lower for patients transported by police, 11.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 3, 15), in relation to EMS, 15 (IQR 14, 15) and private vehicles 15 (IQR 12.5, 15). The 30-day mortality for EMS was 30% (n = 184), 50% (n = 5) for police transport, and 22% (n = 6) for private vehicles. Transport by private vehicle, odds ratio (OR) 0.65, (confidence interval [CI] 0.24, 1.55, p = 0.4) and police OR 2.28 (CI 0.63, 8.3, p = 0.2) were not associated with increased mortality in relation to EMS. Non-EMS transports did occur, however with a low incidence and did not affect mortality. GSWs were more common in police transport, and victims had lower GCS scorescores when arriving at the ED, which warrants further investigations of the operational management of shooting victims in Sweden."

Documenting unique and rare clinical cases, such as traumatic hernia without skin penetration, enriches the medical literature and provides valuable information to identify innovative and optimised approaches for the treatment of similar cases in the future. 48-year-old female with no significant medical history presented to the emergency room after being directly hit by a 1200 kg vehicle while standing in the street. Clinical examination revealed a TAWH with total elevation and total loss of insertion of all abdominal wall muscles on the right side, and no involvement of the overlying skin secondary to the mechanism of trauma. The patient agreed to surgical management after being thoroughly informed about the procedure. Surgical exploration was performed with the patient in a lateral position, and the incision was made over the hernia sac. A monopolar electrocautery was used to expose the iliac crest and fully visualize the defect before drilling through the iliac crest. Soft macroporous polypropylene mesh repair was guided through the iliac crest and abdominal wall using a suture and secured with knots. The patient showed a satisfactory and favorable progress. The present surgical technique is recommended for atypical cases of high-strength TAWH."

We present the case of a 38-year-old male patient who sustained a fall from a significant height, resulting in blunt abdominal trauma, chest injuries, right-side diaphragmatic injury, a grade 4 liver injury, and fractures of the right ribs, right femur, and pelvis. The patient also suffered a lung laceration with hemopneumothorax. The clinical team managed these injuries through a video-assisted thoracoscopy, laparotomy, and primary repair of the diaphragmatic rupture. The postoperative course was complicated by a low-output bile leak and infection of the orthopedic surgical wound, but these were effectively managed, and the patient showed a steady recovery. This case underscores the complexity of managing traumatic injuries that span multiple body regions and systems, requiring a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach. It also highlights the critical role of timely intervention and appropriate surgical strategies in the successful recovery of patients from complex traumas."

    "abstract": "Trauma remains a significant healthcare burden, causing over five million yearly fatalities. Notably, the liver is a frequently injured solid organ in abdominal trauma, especially in patients under 40 years. It becomes even more critical given that uncontrolled hemorrhage linked to liver trauma can have mortality rates ranging from 10% to 50%. Liver injuries, mainly resulting from blunt trauma such as motor vehicle accidents, are traditionally classified using the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grading scale. However, recent developments have introduced the World Society of Emergency Surgery classification, which considers the patient's physiological status. The diagnostic approach often involves multiphase computed tomography (CT). Still, newer methods like split-bolus single-pass CT and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) aim to reduce radiation exposure. Concerning management, nonoperative strategies have emerged as the gold standard, especially for hemodynamically stable patients. Incorporating angiography with embolization has also been beneficial, with success rates reported between 80% and 97%. However, it is essential to identify the specific source of bleeding for effective embolization. Given the severity of liver trauma and its potential complications, innovations in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have been pivotal. While CT remains a primary diagnostic tool, methods like CEUS offer safer alternatives. Moreover, nonoperative management, especially when combined with angiography and embolization, has demonstrated notable success. Still, the healthcare community must remain vigilant to complications and continuously seek improvements in trauma care."

    "abstract": "Patients with penetrating injuries are at a high risk of mortality, and many of them require emergency surgery. Proper triage and transfer of the patient to the emergency department (ED), where immediate definitive treatment is available, is key to improving survival. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with penetrating torso injuries in Incheon Metropolitan City. Data from trauma patients between 2014 and 2018 (5 years) were extracted from the National Emergency Department Information System. In this study, patients with penetrating injuries to the torso (chest and abdomen) were selected, while those with superficial injuries were excluded. Of 66,285 patients with penetrating trauma, 752 with injuries to the torso were enrolled in this study. In the study population, 345 patients (45.9%) were admitted to the ward or intensive care unit (ICU), 20 (2.7%) were transferred to other hospitals, and 10 (1.3%) died in the ED. Among the admitted patients, 173 (50.1%) underwent nonoperative management and 172 (49.9%) underwent operative management. There were no deaths in the nonoperative management group, but 10 patients (5.8%) died after operative management. The transferred patients showed a significantly longer time from injury to ED arrival, percentage of ICU admissions, and mortality. There were also significant differences in the percentage of operative management, ICU admissions, ED stay time, and mortality between hospitals. Proper triage guidelines need to be implemented so that patients with torso penetrating trauma in Incheon can be transferred directly to the regional trauma center for definitive treatment."

We analyzed the treatment outcomes of patients with traumatic cardiac tamponade who were treated at Jeju Regional Trauma Center from January 2018 to August 2022. Seven patients with traumatic cardiac tamponade were treated. The male to female ratio was 1.33:1 (four male and three female patients) and the average age was 60.3±7.2 years. The mechanism of injury was blunt trauma in six cases and penetrating injury in one case. Upon arrival at the emergency department, pericardiostomy was performed in four cases, and an emergency operation was performed in six cases. Pericardiostomy alone was performed in one patient, who had cardiac tamponade due to extrapericardial suprahepatic inferior vena cava rupture. The causes of cardiac tamponade were right atrium appendage rupture in one case, right ventricle rupture in one case, inferior vena cava rupture in two cases, right atrium and left atrium rupture in one case, both atria and left ventricle rupture in one case, and intercostal artery rupture in one case. In three cases, intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass was required. Two of the seven patients died (mortality rate, 28.5%). Relatively favorable treatment results were observed for traumatic cardiac tamponade patients after Jeju Regional Trauma Center was established."

    "abstract": "Behind armor blunt trauma (BABT) is a non-penetrating injury caused by energy transfer and rapid deformation of protective body armor. Although modern military body armor is designed to prevent penetrating trunk injuries, high-energy projectiles can produce a significant energy transfer to tissues behind the armor and inflict injuries such as fractures or organ contusions. However, knowledge of BABT is limited to biomechanical and cadaver modeling studies and rare case reports. We report two cases of BABT resulting from close-range fire and discuss the potential implications for triaging patients with BABT in battlefield scenarios. In the first case, a 19-year-old male soldier sustained a single close-range 5.56-mm assault rifle gunshot to his chest body armor. The soldier initially reported mild pain in the parasternal region and assessment revealed a 4 cm × 3 cm skin abrasion. Following emergency department evaluation, the soldier was diagnosed with a non-displaced transverse fracture of the sternal body. In the second case, a 20-year-old male sustained five machine gun bullets (7.62 mm) to his body armor. Computed tomography of the chest revealed pulmonary contusions in the right lower and middle lobes. Both soldiers achieved full recovery and returned to combat duty within several weeks. These cases highlight the potential risks of energy transfer from high-velocity projectiles impacting body armor and the need for frontline providers to be aware of the risk of underlying blunt injuries. Further reporting of clinical cases and modeling studies using high-velocity projectiles could inform recommendations for triaging, evacuating, and assessing individuals with BABT."

    "abstract": "Gossypiboma or textiloma is a rare medical situation that can complicate the favorable evolution of a surgical case, with repercussions for the patient's prognosis. The diagnosis can be difficult due to various clinical symptoms, the time elapsed since the surgical intervention, and the imaging often not being precise in detecting textilomas. Due to the medicolegal implications, the reporting of this event is inconsistent. We present a rare case of a 28-year-old woman who presented with vague pain in the left iliac fossa 11 months after an emergency cesarean hysterectomy was performed. The preoperative imaging examination identified the presence of a subhepatic mass with dimensions of 10 × 8 cm2 and another formation in the right iliac fossa with dimensions of 11 × 9 cm2. Exploratory laparotomy found the presence of a large subhepatic gossypiboma, intimately adherent to the hepatic angle of the colon and omentum and a second one adherent to the sigmoid colon, small intestine, and parietal peritoneum. The particularity of this case is given by the simultaneous presence of two textilomas with inconclusive evolution, which can make the differential diagnosis difficult to achieve. For a better assessment of the risk of occurrence of this pathology and the identification of a correct prevention strategy, we performed an extensive search and a review of all the articles published in the PubMed database, identifying 57 articles. In conclusion, emergency surgery increases the risk of this complication, and, as a result, prevention can be achieved by following existing protocols in the operating room."

    "abstract": "An obturator hernia is a rare cause of bowel obstruction. Due to its narrow passage in the obturator canal, these are more susceptible to becoming incarcerated and subsequently strangulated. Due to its challenging detection, obturator hernia is often diagnosed late. A 75-year-old thin-built female with COPD presented to the emergency room with symptoms of abdominal obstruction. Abdominal examination revealed distension, firmness, rigidity, and tenderness with no bowel sounds. An erect abdominal X-ray showed multiple air-fluid levels, indicating an acute abdomen due to intestinal obstruction. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed an obturator hernia with strangulated ileum and perforation, necessitating resection and double barrel ileostomy. Unfortunately, despite all medical interventions, the patient succumbed to hospital-acquired pneumonia following the surgery. Obturator hernia, known as 'the skinny old woman hernia,' is rarely externally visible or palpable, leading to frequent undiagnosed cases. It presents with bowel obstruction or perforation and carries the highest morbidity among abdominal hernias. Timely intervention is crucial to prevent complications like bowel strangulation. This case report highlights the challenges of diagnosing and managing obturator hernia, a rare condition with significant morbidity. Early detection through imaging or operative findings is crucial to prevent complications like bowel strangulation, especially in older women at higher risk."

There is little evidence to support or refute this for pediatric trauma. The objective of this investigation was to describe national trends in prehospital transport time, in relation to the \"Golden Hour,\" and pediatric trauma outcomes. Retrospective cohort study of patients (<15 y old) receiving emergency medical services trauma transport between 2017 and 2019. Transport time (less than or greater than 60 min) was the exposure variable, and analyses were adjusted for injury severity score (ISS). Continuous variables with a normal distribution were compared by t-test was and skewed variables were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test. Categorical variables were compared by Chi-Square test. 54,489 patients met our criteria: 49,628 blunt and 4861 penetrating. Most patients (62.2%) had transport times less than 60 min: 30,389 (61.2%) blunt and 3479 (71.6%) penetrating. The overall mortality rate was 1.6%, 1.2% for blunt and 5.5% for penetrating. For blunt trauma, mortality was higher for transport times less than 60 min (1.5%). For penetrating trauma, mortality was lower for transport times less than 60 min (0.7%). Mean ISS was greater for blunt (7.9) compared to penetrating trauma (7.1), and greater for both trauma types with transport times less than 60 min. For both trauma types, mean length of stay was significantly longer for transport times greater than 60 min, when adjusting for ISS (P < 0.001). We did not find evidence that prehospital transport within the \"Golden Hour\" had a substantial association with survival, though it may be associated with length of stay. There are many factors contributing to trauma outcomes, so efforts should continue to expand access and pediatric readiness."

Her blood pressure could not be measured, therefore aortic cross-clamping was performed, and epinephrine was administered for resuscitation, an emergency laparotomy was performed, and the roots of splenic artery and common hepatic artery were ligated. The left gastric artery which was anomalous and arose directly from the aorta, was also injured and had to be ligated. Norepinephrine was required after the surgery. Enhanced computed tomography performed on hospital day 4 revealed a disrupted celiac artery. The patient developed gastric necrosis on hospital day 23 and, hence, underwent total gastrectomy was performed. The possibility of delayed stomach necrosis should be considered during the postoperative management of patients who undergo ligation of all of the celiac artery branches and experience global hypoperfusion after the surgery."

    "title": "Trivial Blunt Chest Trauma Leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in a Child.",
    "abstract": "Both blunt and penetrating chest trauma in children are less common than in adults but cause severe acute morbidity and mortality. As the literature suggests, pulmonary contusion is the most common chest injury in children, occurring in more than half of all blunt chest trauma cases. Even patients with blunt injuries are likely to have a longer hospital stay. The difference in physiological and anatomical variations in children compared to adults makes it more difficult from the diagnosis, management, and monitoring perspectives. A thorough physical examination is needed with close clinical monitoring, and additional vigilance is important during the management of a child. The physiologic consequences, such as the dreaded complication of alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary parenchymal destruction, usually manifest within a few hours of the trauma and can take up to seven days to recover. Hence, timely diagnosis is crucial during the emergency evaluation. The clinical diagnosis can be supported by a special imaging modality in the form of chest computed tomography (CT), which confirms the radiological parenchymal destruction with high sensitivity. Management is mostly supportive to start with and includes high-flow oxygen, ventilatory pressure support as needed for the severity of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), judicious fluid administration, control of the pain associated with bony and thoracic soft tissue injuries, and careful hemodynamic monitoring for other complications and sequelae likely to develop. Here, we report an interesting case of a 10-year-old male child presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department with acute moderate-to-severe respiratory distress that developed after two days of a few vomiting episodes along with non-specific lower chest and substernal pain following blunt trauma to the chest. The injury was trivial in nature as described by the father caused by an accidental fall on a small pile of bricks while playing near his home. After triaging under the red category, the child was managed in line with acute respiratory distress. We ruled out pneumothorax, hemorrhagic pleural effusion or pericardial effusion, and other evidence of invasive chest as well as gross abdominal injuries by comprehensive but focused history and clinical examinations, including adjuncts such as point-of-care ultrasound) and chest X-ray (CXR). Although the initial arterial blood gas analyses were suggestive of a mild form of ARDS or ALI by the criteria based on the P:F ratio (PaO2 to FiO2 ratio, which was between 200 and 300 for the case), the CXR and the chest CT revealed that the child had significant lung parenchymal injury in the form of bilateral fluffy pulmonary infiltrates. This case indicates that even a trivial blunt trauma can induce certain mechanisms of lung injury, leading to severe manifestations and sometimes fatal complications such as pulmonary contusion, hemorrhage, and ARDS."

Implementing a risk assessment tool has the potential to reduce variation in these decisions and unnecessary radiation exposure for pediatric patients. We sought to determine how emergency department-trauma team dynamics may affect implementation of such a tool. We interviewed (pediatric and general emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons and ED nurses at 21 hospitals to ascertain how team dynamics affect the pediatric cervical spine imaging decision-making process. Data were coded following a framework-driven deductive coding process and thematic analysis was used. Forty-eight physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses from 21 hospitals (inclusive of three US regions, trauma levels I-III, and serving towns/cities of various population sizes) were interviewed. Overall, emergency physicians and trauma surgeons indicate being generally responsible for pediatric cervical spine imaging decisions. Conflict often occurs between these specialties due to differential weighting of concerns for missing an injury versus avoiding radiation exposure. Participants described a lack of trust and unclear roles regarding ownership for the final imaging decision. Nurses commonly described low psychological safety that prohibits them from participating in the decision-making process. Implementation of a standardized risk assessment tool for cervical spine trauma imaging decisions must consider perspectives of both emergency medicine and trauma. Policies to define appropriate use of standardized tools within this team environment should be developed."

    "abstract": "To describe and explore the risk factors, clinical presentations, timely diagnostic approaches, and management in patients experiencing unscarred uterine rupture with catastrophic hemorrhage. We retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data from women who encountered postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and were diagnosed with unscarred uterine rupture within a three-year timeframe (2018-2020). The data were extracted from medical records obtained from a multi-hospital 24-hour emergency PPH transfer system. Six patients were identified as having unscarred uterine rupture after vaginal delivery. All six women were para 2, with four of them undergoing vacuum-assisted delivery. One patient experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), while five patients presented with hypovolemic shock. Abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed a boggy lower uterine segment. Initially, five patients underwent transarterial embolization (TAE) of the internal iliac arteries in an attempt to achieve hemostasis, but this approach proved unsuccessful. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) confirmed the diagnosis of ruptured uterus by demonstrating disrupted myometrium and hemoperitoneum. Immediate exploratory laparotomy followed by life-saving hysterectomy was performed in all cases. The median estimated total blood loss was 2725 mL ± 900 mL (ranging from 1600 mL to 7100 mL). Lower segment lacerations were observed in all patients, with more extensive uterine damage noted in those who underwent vacuum extraction. The length of hospital stay varied between 9 and 38 days. Instrument-assisted obstetric delivery is a possible contributing factor to unscarred uterine rupture in our study. In specific cases, the use of abdominopelvic CT prior to initiating transarterial embolization (TAE) offers valuable information to complement ultrasound findings. This comprehensive approach helps in accurately identifying the underlying cause of intractable postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Immediate conversion to laparotomy is essential to explore the intra-abdominal factors causing PPH that cannot be controlled by TAE. The rational etiologies of uterine rupture must be clarified while generating practical guideline in the future."

    "title": "Intensive Care Physician-Led Clearance of the Cervical Spine: A Retrospective Review of the Utility of a Normal Cervical CT Scan for Safe Removal of Hard Collars by Critical Care Physicians.",
    "abstract": "Background: Cervical spine clearance in intubated patients due to blunt trauma remains contentious. Accumulating evidence suggests that a normal computed tomography (CT) cervical spine can be used to clear the cervical spine and remove the collar in unconscious patients presenting to the emergency department. However, whether this strategy can safely be employed by critical care physicians with intubated patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) with cervical collars in situ, has not been definitively studied. Methods: A retrospective review of 730 intubated victims of trauma who presented to the Level 1 Trauma center of a tertiary hospital was conducted. The rates of missed cervical injuries in patients who had their cervical collars removed by intensive care physicians based on a normal CT scan of the cervical spine, were reviewed. Secondary outcomes included rates of collar-related complications. Results: Three hundred and fifty patients had their cervical collars removed by Trauma ICU doctors based on a high-quality, radiologist-interpreted normal CT cervical spine. Seventy percent of patients were sedated and/or comatose at the time of collar removal. Fifty-one percent of patients had concomitant traumatic brain injury. The average GCS at time of collar removal was 9. The incidence of missed neurological injury discerned clinically at time of both ICU and hospital discharge was nil (negative predictive value 100%). The rate of collar-related complications was 2%. Conclusion: Cervical collar removal by intensive care physicians on TICU following normal CT cervical spine, is safe, provided certain quality conditions related to the CT scan are met. Not removing the collar early may be associated with increased complications. An algorithm is suggested to assist critical care decision-making in this patient cohort."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion, particularly fishbone, is a prevalent medical complaint in the emergency department. Usually, these foreign substances pass through the gastrointestinal tract without causing any complications. The clinical manifestations of foreign body consumption are non-specific. A 32-year-old male patient presented to our hospital with severe abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen and tenderness. Plain chest and abdominal X-rays were unremarkable. The performed computed tomography (CT) of the abdominopelvic region showed multiple abscesses. Then, an exploratory laparotomy was decided during which a foreign body, a fishbone, was detected and the affected omental mass was resected, and abscess drainage was done. The resected specimen was sent for histopathological studies. The postoperative period was uneventful. Perforation of the intestinal wall by fishbone ingestion is an unusual entity. The clinical features of intestinal perforation are usually non-specific resulting in delayed diagnosis. Based on individual situations, the treatment strategy can be surgical or non-surgical. Even though ingesting a foreign body is a frequent complaint in clinical practice, its repercussions are extremely rare. Our case presented multiple intra-abdominal abscesses and perforation as a complication of accidental fishbone ingestion."

    "abstract": "The main cause of death in traumas is hypovolemic shock. Physical examination is limited to detect hemopericardium, hemoperitoneum, and hemopneumothorax. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for traumatic injury evaluation. However, CT is not always available, is more expensive, and there are transportation issues, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients. In this scenario, a rapid, reproducible, portable, and noninvasive method such as ultrasound emerged, directed for detecting hemopericardium, hemoperitoneum, and hemopneumothorax, in a \"point of care\" modality, known as the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) protocol. With decades of experience, spread worldwide, and recommended by the most prestigious trauma care guidelines, FAST is a bedside ultrasound to be performed when accessing circulation issues of trauma patients. It is indicated to hemodynamically unstable patients with blunt abdominal trauma, with penetrating trauma of the thoracoabdominal transition (where there is doubt of penetrating the abdominal cavity) and for any patient with the cause of the instability unknown. There are four regions to be examined in the traditional FAST protocol: pericardium (to detect cardiac tamponade), right upper abdominal quadrant, left upper abdominal quadrant, and pelvis (to detect hemoperitoneum). The called extended FAST (e-FAST) protocol also searches the pleural spaces for hemothorax and pneumothorax. It is important to know the false positives and false negatives of the protocol, as well as its limitations. FAST/e-FAST protocol is designed to provide a simple \"yes or no\" answer regarding the presence of bleeding. It is not intended to quantify the bleeding nor evaluate organ lesions due to its limited accuracy for these purposes. Moreover, the amount of bleeding and/or the identification of organ lesions will not change patient's management: Hemodynamically unstable patients with positive FAST must go to the operating room without delay. CT should be considered for hemodynamically stable patients."

Early detection and treatment are vital due to their high potential for metastasis and recurrence. We present a case of a 28-year-old man who exhibited a cough and shortness of breath. Laboratory tests revealed elevated tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Imaging studies displayed a large mediastinal mass, causing the right displacement of the mediastinum and cardiac tamponade. The biopsy confirmed a non-seminomatous GCT, specifically a yolk sac tumor. The patient experienced pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade after receiving two cycles of etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy. To relieve the tamponade, an emergency pericardiocentesis was performed malignant GCTs necessitate prompt diagnosis and treatment and utilizing multimodal therapy such as chemotherapy to achieve tumor control. Due to the high risk of metastasis, vigilant surveillance for recurrence is essential, emphasizing the need for specific criteria for accurate early detection."

Blunt trauma, including motorcycle collisions, is a common cause of testicular rupture. In the case of multi-trauma, the diagnosis of testicular rupture may be missed in the rush to surgical intervention of more grossly obvious injuries. We present a case of a 24-year-old male who suffered a motorcycle accident and subsequently presented with diffuse abdominal and hip pain. Physical exam and imaging at the emergency department showed multiple pelvic bone fractures, along with a small scrotal injury which was triaged below his pelvic injuries. His pelvic fractures were immediately operated on. Nearly 18 hours after his initial presentation, the patient received a scrotal ultrasound which demonstrated a rupture of the right testicle. Due to this long delay in diagnosis, his urological team opted for non-surgical management and instead employed a more conservative treatment regimen involving pain control, scrotal support, rest, and serial scrotal ultrasounds. This case highlights the importance of timely ultrasound examination for testicular pathology in the setting of multi-trauma and known scrotal injury. Another highlight of this case is the showcase of an uncommon treatment regimen utilizing conservative tactics as opposed to opting for surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is a prevalent malignant tumor worldwide and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a frequent complication of GC. Radical gastrectomy and palliative therapy are widely used surgical procedures in the clinical management of GC. This study intends to probe the clinical efficacy and safety of radical gastrectomy and palliative therapy on the basis of exploratory laparotomy in patients with GC combined with UGIB, hoping to provide valuable information to aid patients in selecting the appropriate surgical intervention. To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of exploratory laparotomy + radical gastrectomy and palliative therapy in patients with GC and UGIB combined. A total of 89 GC patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of South China between July 2018 and July 2020 were selected as participants for this study. The 89 patients were divided into two groups: radical resection group (n = 46) treated with exploratory laparotomy + radical gastrectomy and Palliative group (n = 43) treated with palliative therapy. The study compared several variables between the two groups, including surgical duration, intraoperative blood transfusion volume, postoperative anal exhaust time, off-bed activity time, length of hospitalization, and incidence of complications such as duodenal stump rupture, anastomotic obstruction, and postoperative incision. Additionally, postoperative immune function indicators (including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, and CD3+/HLADR+), immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM), tumor markers (CEA, CA199, and CA125), and inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α) were assessed. The surgical efficacy and postoperative quality of life recovery were also evaluated. The patients were monitored for survival and tumor recurrence at 6 mo, 1 year, and 2 years post-surgery. The results indicated that the duration of operation time and postoperative hospitalization did not differ between the two surgical procedures. However, patients in the radical resection group exhibited shorter intraoperative blood loss, anus exhaust time, off-bed activity time, and inpatient activity time than those in the Palliative group. Although there was no substantial difference in the occurrence of postoperative complications, such as duodenal stump rupture and anastomotic obstruction, between the radical resection group and Palliative group (P > 0.05), the radical resection group exhibited higher postoperative immune function indicators (including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, etc.) and immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM) than the Palliative group, while tumor markers and inflammatory factors levels were lower than those in the radical resection group. Additionally, surgical efficacy, postoperative quality of life, and postoperative survival rates were higher in patients who underwent radical gastrectomy than in those who underwent palliative therapy. Moreover, the probability of postoperative tumor recurrence was lower in the radical gastrectomy group compared to the palliative therapy group, and these differences were all statistically significant (P < 0.05). Compared to palliative therapy, exploratory laparotomy + radical gastrectomy can improve immune function, reduce the levels of tumor markers and inflammatory factors, improve surgical efficacy, promote postoperative quality of life recovery, enhance survival rates, and attenuate the probability of tumor recurrence."

We aim to describe the changes in pediatric firearm-related injuries, demographics, and associated risk factors at a Level 1 trauma center in Houston before and during the COVID 19 pandemic. The total number of pediatric firearm-related injury cases increased during March 15th to December 31st, 2020 and 2021 compared to the same time period in 2019 (104 verses 89 verses 78).

She was six weeks pregnant based on an unknown and unsure last menstrual cycle. The diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy was suspected based on a positive urine pregnancy test and a pelvic ultrasound that revealed an empty uterus and a copious amount of free fluid within the abdomen. Significant hematoperitoneum and hemodynamic instability required emergent exploratory laparotomy with findings of a ruptured left cornual ectopic pregnancy. A left cornual resection and repair was done with an uneventful postoperative period. With cornual ectopic pregnancies being a rare entity, our case emphasizes the importance of early detection and management to help prevent fatal complications."

    "abstract": "Trauma is the leading cause of death in patients <45 years living in high-resource settings. However, penetrating chest injuries are still relatively rare in Europe - with an upwards trend. These cases are of particular interest to emergency medical services (EMS) due to available invasive treatment options like chest tube placement or resuscitative thoracotomy. To date, there is no sufficient data from Austria regarding penetrating chest trauma in a metropolitan area, and no reliable source to base decisions regarding further skill proficiency training on. For this retrospective observational study, we screened all trauma emergency responses of the Viennese EMS between 01/2009 and 12/2017 and included all those with a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) score ≥ IV (= potentially life-threatening). Data were derived from EMS mission documentations and hospital files, and for those cases with the injuries leading to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), we assessed the EMS cardiac arrest registry and consulted a forensic physician. We included 480 cases of penetrating chest injuries of NACA IV-VII (83% male, 64% > 30 years old, 74% stab wounds, 16% cuts, 8% gunshot wounds, 56% inflicted by another party, 26% self-inflicted, 18% unknown). In the study period, the incidence rose from 1.4/100,000 to 3.5/100,000 capita, and overall, about one case was treated per week. In the cases with especially severe injury patterns (= NACA V-VII, 43% of total), (tension-)pneumothorax was the most common injury (29%). The highest mortality was seen in injuries to pulmonary vessels (100%) or the heart (94%). Fifty-eight patients (12% of total) deceased, whereas in 15 cases, the forensic physician stated survival could theoretically have been possible. However, only five of these CPR patients received at least unilateral thoracostomy. Regarding all penetrating chest injuries, thoracostomy had only been performed in eight patients. Severe cases of penetrating chest trauma are rare in Vienna and happened about once a week between 2009 and 2017. Both incidence and case load increased over the years, and potentially life-saving invasive procedures were only reluctantly applied. Therefore, a structured educational and skill retention approach aimed at both paramedics and emergency physicians should be implemented. Retrospective analysis without intervention."

    "abstract": "Primary and metastatic carcinoma of the small intestine are rare. While most of these malignancies are adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the gastrointestinal tract is uncommon. We present a case report of a rare occurrence of skin SCC metastasizing to the ileum, highlighting diagnostic challenges and clinical implications. An 83-year-old female had a history of cutaneous SCC excision in the right temporal region two years prior to the current emergency department visit, followed by metastatic recurrence in a right intra-parotid lymph node treated with radiotherapy. The patient exhibited septic shock and an acute abdomen, and an abdominal computed tomography scan revealed signs of intestinal perforation. Emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed purulent peritonitis and perforation of the terminal ileum. Subsequently, a 20 cm intestinal resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed a 4 cm perforated SCC of the small intestine (pT4 pN0 L0 V1 Pn0 R0). Metastases of the small intestine are rare. The primary sites for these metastases are typically the uterus, cervix, colon, lung, breast, or melanoma. SCC of the small intestine is particularly rare and poses challenges in diagnosis owing to non-specific symptoms. The prognosis for SCC of the small intestine is generally poor, and the potentially aggressive behavior of some skin SCC emphasizes the need for increased awareness and vigilance in managing such cases. This case report underscores the importance of considering metastatic disease in the small bowel of patients with a history of skin SCC who present with new-onset abdominal symptoms."

The patient was eventually diagnosed with cardiac tamponade as a cause of her dyspnea, as a two-dimensional cardiac echocardiogram detected a large pericardial effusion (>2 cm) with echocardiographic indications for cardiac tamponade with severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient underwent a therapeutic pericardial window with drainage of 250 mL of pericardial fluid. Ultrasound of the abdomen focusing on the kidneys showed an atrophic and echogenic right kidney with a bidirectional flow in the hepatic veins, suggestive of right heart failure. Subsequently, she underwent a kidney biopsy that showed diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis with segmental sclerosing features consistent with IgA nephropathy, associated with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, interstitial inflammation, and moderate arteriosclerosis. The patient was diagnosed with stage V chronic kidney disease secondary to IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy is usually common in Caucasian or Asian males in their teens and late 30s, with hematuria as a usual presentation. This case is unique as cardiac tamponade with renal failure is rarely the presenting symptom of IgA nephropathy."

With the advent of cutting-edge technology, rapid volumetric computed tomography of the chest has become the most definitive diagnostic tool for establishing or excluding thoracic trauma. With the notion of \"time is life\" at emergency settings, radiologists must find ways to shorten the turnaround time of reports. One way to interpret chest findings is to use a systemic approach, as advocated in this study. Our interpretation of chest findings for thoracic trauma follows the acronym \"ABC-Please\" in which \"A\" stands for abnormal air, \"B\" stands for abnormal bones, \"C\" stands for abnormal cardiovascular system, and \"P\" in \"Please\" stands for abnormal pulmonary parenchyma and vessels. In the future, utilizing an artificial intelligence software can be an alternative, which can highlight significant findings as \"warm zones\" on the heatmap and can re-prioritize important examinations at the top of the reading list for radiologists to expedite the final reports."

    "abstract": "A 64-year-old man was transferred to our hospital due to a diagnosis of Stanford type A acute aortic dissection complicated by cardiac tamponade. He was in shock status as well. Careful inspection of contrast- enhanced computed tomography revealed Kommerell's diverticulum with the aberrant right subclavian artery running behind the esophagus. The artery connected to the right axillary artery. The left vertebral artery was separately branched from the aortic arch. Primary entry was not detected on the preoperative computed tomography( CT). Left ventricular function was preserved by transthoracic echocardiography. At emergency surgery, total aortic arch replacement with reconstruction of the right axillary artery, both carotid arteries, and the left subclavian artery along with the left vertebral artery was successfully performed. The aberrant right subclavian artery was ligated at the origin. Kommerell' s diverticulum was completely excluded. Postoperative contrast-enhanced CT showed the patency of all reconstructed arteries. Although he suffered from acute cholecystitis and persistent bilateral pleural effusion, he was discharged in a good condition."

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic hernia (DH) presenting acutely can be a potentially life-threatening condition. Its management continues to be debatable. A bibliographic search using major databases was performed using the terms \"emergency surgery\" \"diaphragmatic hernia,\" \"traumatic diaphragmatic rupture\" and \"congenital diaphragmatic hernia.\" GRADE methodology was used to evaluate the evidence and give recommendations. CT scan of the chest and abdomen is the diagnostic gold standard to evaluate complicated DH. Appropriate preoperative assessment and prompt surgical intervention are important for a clinical success. Complicated DH repair is best performed via the use of biological and bioabsorbable meshes which have proven to reduce recurrence. The laparoscopic approach is the preferred technique in hemodynamically stable patients without significant comorbidities because it facilitates early diagnosis of small diaphragmatic injuries from traumatic wounds in the thoraco-abdominal area and reduces postoperative complications. Open surgery should be reserved for situations when skills and equipment for laparoscopy are not available, where exploratory laparotomy is needed, or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Damage Control Surgery is an option in the management of critical and unstable patients. Complicated diaphragmatic hernia is a rare life-threatening condition. CT scan of the chest and abdomen is the gold standard for diagnosing the diaphragmatic hernia. Laparoscopic repair is the best treatment option for stable patients with complicated diaphragmatic hernias. Open repair is considered necessary in majority of unstable patients in whom Damage Control Surgery can be life-saving."

    "abstract": "An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) may be placed preoperatively for high-risk patients with reduced ejection fraction or multivessel coronary disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has both anesthetic and cardioprotective effects, and little evidence is present on its effect on minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and bispectral index (BIS). We present the case of a high-risk cardiac patient who was admitted and required fluid optimization prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). An IABP was placed after failure to tolerate intermittent hemodialysis (iHD). Bowel ischemia complicated this patient's course, necessitating an urgent exploratory laparotomy with the IABP in place. DEX and 0.3-MAC sevoflurane were successfully used without perioperative cardiac complications. Continuous BIS monitoring was performed to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia. DEX should be considered as an alternative anesthetic adjuvant in high-risk and medically complex patients."

    "abstract": "Blunt cerebrovascular injuries (BCVIs) are commonly encountered after blunt trauma. Given the increased risk of stroke incurred after BCVI, it is crucial that they are promptly identified, characterized, and treated appropriately. Current screening practices generally consist of computed tomography angiography (CTA), with escalation to digital subtraction angiography for higher-grade injuries. Although it is quick, cost-effective, and readily available, CTA suffers from poor sensitivity and positive predictive value. A review of the current literature was conducted to examine the current state of emergent imaging for BCVI. After excluding reviews, irrelevant articles, and articles exclusively available in non-English languages, 36 articles were reviewed and included in the analysis. In general, as CTA technology has advanced, so too has detection of BCVI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with sequences such as vessel wall imaging, double-inversion recovery with black blood imaging, and magnetization prepared rapid acquisition echo have notably improved the utility for MRI in characterizing BCVIs. Finally, transcranial Doppler with emboli detection has proven to be associated with strokes in anterior circulation injuries, further allowing for the identification of high-risk lesions. Overall, imaging for BCVI has benefited from a tremendous amount of innovation, resulting in better detection and characterization of this pathology."

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the impact of emergency medical service (EMS) scene time variability on adult and pediatric trauma patient outcomes with moderate or severe penetrating injuries. This retrospective study analyzed the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database between 2017 and 2020 to evaluate the relationship between EMS scene time on adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe injuries. Primary outcomes included Dead on Arrival (DOA) to the Emergency Department (ED), ED mortality, 24-hour mortality, and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association of each EMS scene time category and mortality. Adult patients with 10-30 minutes of EMS scene time had increased odds of experiencing ED mortality, 24-hour mortality, and in-hospital mortality. Adults with >30 minutes of EMS scene time were more likely to be DOA to the ED. There was no significant association with mortality for patients with <10 minutes of EMS scene time. In the pediatric subset of patients, those with 10-30 minutes of EMS scene time were more likely to experience ED mortality and in-hospital mortality. EMS scene times less than 10 minutes were associated with the greatest odds of survival, supporting the \"load and go\" theory for penetrating trauma. Our study suggests that even an EMS scene time of 10-30 minutes results in a significantly increased risk of mortality, and further efforts are needed to improve scene time through improved EMS and hospital policies."

    "title": "Cardiac tamponade.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency caused by the progressive accumulation of pericardial fluid (effusion), blood, pus or air in the pericardium, compressing the heart chambers and leading to haemodynamic compromise, circulatory shock, cardiac arrest and death. Pericardial diseases of any aetiology as well as complications of interventional and surgical procedures or chest trauma can cause cardiac tamponade. Tamponade can be precipitated in patients with pericardial effusion by dehydration or exposure to certain medications, particularly vasodilators or intravenous diuretics. Key clinical findings in patients with cardiac tamponade are hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure and distant heart sounds (Beck triad). Dyspnoea can progress to orthopnoea (with no rales on lung auscultation) accompanied by weakness, fatigue, tachycardia and oliguria. In tamponade caused by acute pericarditis, the patient can experience fever and typical chest pain increasing on inspiration and radiating to the trapezius ridge. Generally, cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis that can be confirmed using various imaging modalities, principally echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade is preferably resolved by echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis. In patients who have recently undergone cardiac surgery and in those with neoplastic infiltration, effusive-constrictive pericarditis, or loculated effusions, fluoroscopic guidance can increase the feasibility and safety of the procedure. Surgical management is indicated in patients with aortic dissection, chest trauma, bleeding or purulent infection that cannot be controlled percutaneously. After pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, NSAIDs and colchicine can be considered to prevent recurrence and effusive-constrictive pericarditis."

We present the case of a 60-day-old baby who presented in the Paediatric Emergency Department with progressive abdominal distension and bloody stools. Abdominal X-ray showed dilated bowel and ultrasound imaging showed a target sign positive for intussusception. The baby was rushed to the operating room (OR) due to delayed presentation, where an uneventful exploratory laparotomy was performed. Acute intestinal intussusception remains a cause of low morbidity and mortality rates if recognised earlier."

    "abstract": "Targeted audience could be learners in medical field with basic knowledge of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), pulmonary and emergency medicine for example, medical students, emergency medicine residents (1st-3rd year), emergency physicians at all level of trainings, or emergency medicine physician's assistants. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is rapidly becoming an essential part of emergency medicine and patient care .1,2 POCUS can provide more detailed clinical information when used in conjunction with a physical examination, overall aiding clinicians' decision-making capacity.3 POCUS also proves a cost-effective tool in reducing the number of advanced imaging studies ordered and unnecessary patient radiation exposure.3,4 Performing POCUS has also proved beneficial for patient satisfaction because it increases the amount of face-to-face time spent with the patient while also providing live imaging interpretation during the emergency department visits .3,5,6 POCUS-Pulmonary can also create a safer environment for both medical staff and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.6 Performing POCUS-Pulmonary on suspected COVID-19 patients can limit the number of patients receiving thoracic CT studies to confirm COVID-19 related pneumonia.6,7 Performing POCUS-Pulmonary reduces the number of patients transferred between the radiology department and the emergency department, significantly reduces overall possible COVID-19 exposures, and reduces equipment cleaning time.6 Given the overall reduction of advanced imaging studies ordered, CT scanners would be more readily available for critical care patients, such as trauma or other hemodynamic instability.6 Emergency providers practicing in rural areas with limited resources may benefit from the use of POCUS -Pulmonary, facilitating better patient care at decreased exposure-rate, cleaning cost, and overall increase in patient satisfaction given more bedside patient-provider communication.6-8 POCUS-Pulmonary is a crucial clinical skill for emergency medicine providers everywhere.6,8 Clinicians should be able to perform POCUS-Pulmonary, interpret image findings, and develop a treatment plan promptly.9. By the end of performing the Zombie Cruise Ship Virtual Escape Room, learners will be able to: 1) recognize sonographic signs of A-line, B-line, Barcode sign, Bat sign, Seashore Sign, Plankton sign, Jellyfish Sign, Lung point, lung lockets, and Lung pulse; 2) differentiate sonographic findings of pneumothorax, hemothorax, pneumonia, COVID 19 pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion from normal lung findings; 3) distinguish pneumonia from atelectasis by recognizing dynamic air bronchogram; and 4) recognize indications for performing POCUS pulmonary such as dyspnea, blunt trauma, fall, cough and/or heart failure. This group-based learning program was designed for use in virtual meetings, lectures, and in small-group learning activities, such as didactic and EM conferences. A Google form was used to create a virtual escape room for learners in which they had to take quizzes to advance to the next level. Learners may enact teamwork through discussion and group effort, or respond individually to ultrasound pulmonary questions. Learners will take pre and post-test assessment to compare the learners POCUS-Pulmonary knowledge before and after small group, virtual escape room learning. All participants in the virtual escape room game are given a pre and post-test assessment comprised of seventeen total questions: two questions asking the participant's training level, and fifteen POCUS-Pulmonary questions. Pre and Post-test questions are identical; however, the participants' answers to the pre-test assessment are not revealed to them on completion. Instead, participants receive a letter grade on completing the pre-test assessment. Participants complete the pre and post-test assessments over fifteen minutes allotted before and after the virtual escape room. Upon completing the post-test assessment, a letter grade and the correct answers were given to the participants. Twenty-four emergency medicine resident physicians (PGY 1-3)) participated in the Zombie Cruise Ship Escape Room pre-test, while a total of twenty-three resident physicians participated in the post-test assessment. The pre-test data showed an average of 10.33 points, compared to post-test data, which showed 11.91 points. There was an improvement of two points on the median score with a median pre-test score of 10 vs. the post-test median of 12. The virtual zombie cruise ship experience proved a practical and useful tool in increasing overall participants' interest in POCUS pulmonary during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants had higher retention after actively discussing and researching the most up-to-date clinical information during the virtual and inperson small group meetings. The game encouraged participants to make decisions quickly. This pace created a fun competition between participants who genuinely enjoyed the learning experience even during the COVID-19 pandemic via Zoom/Google Meet virtual conferences. By creating a virtual escape learning tool, learners can experience teamwork-based learning without concern for group size limitations during the pandemic.

We report a patient with small intestinal obstruction due to a primary enterolith. A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with central colicky abdominal pain, absolute constipation followed by vomiting. An enterolith located in distal ileum causing small intestinal obstruction was established with the aid of abdominal X-ray radiograph and computed tomography. Exploratory laparotomy was performed to extract the enterolith and to resect a strictured proximal jejunal segment which was suspected to be the original site of enterolith formation. Chemical analysis of the enterolith supports the speculation of a proximally formed primary enterolith eventually migrating to the site of impaction in the terminal ileum."

    "abstract": "Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a condition characterized by an exaggerated response of the immune system (a hypersensitivity response) to the fungus Aspergillus. Aspergillus-associated pericarditis leading to pericardial tamponade is rare. In our case, we presented a case of a 22-year-old female asthmatic patient with no other medical conditions who presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of severe chest tightness and shortness of breath. Echocardiography revealed significant pleural and pericardial effusion consistent with cardiac tamponade. Both pleural and pericardial fluids were hemorrhagic. Four months later, she presented to the ED with chief complaints of shortness of breath and a cough lasting two days. She was admitted as a case of asthma exacerbation. In the following months, when the patient visited the pulmonology outpatient clinic, the doctors recommended for specific IgE test. Allergen-specific IgE testing was positive for A. fumigatus to confirm the presence of ABPA. As we rolled out other causes of cardiac tamponade, we link the development of cardiac tamponade secondary to an underlying Aspergillus infection. We report this case with the aim of improving clinical knowledge regarding probable causes of cardiac tamponade in patients with asthma, which may facilitate the establishment of early diagnosis and treatment protocols."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is an impending calamitous disorder that emergency physicians need to consider and diagnose rapidly. A pericardial effusion with right atrial systolic collapse (earliest sign) or right ventricular diastolic collapse (most specific sign) and a plethoric inferior vena cava are indicators of cardiac tamponade physiology and may be identified with point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS). The goal of this study is to assess the agreement among emergency physicians with varying levels of sonographic training and expertise in interpreting echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade in adult patients.  Methods: Emergency physicians at different levels of training as sonographers were surveyed at didactic conferences at three major academic medical centers in northern New Jersey. Two cardiologists were also included in the study for comparison. Survey respondents were shown 15, 20-second video clips of patients who had presented to the emergency department (ED) with or without significant pericardial effusions and were asked to rate whether tamponade physiology was present or not. Data were collected anonymously on Google Forms (Google LLC, Mountain View, CA) and included self-reported levels of POCUS expertise and level of training. Data were analyzed using Fleiss' kappa (k). All patients had an echocardiogram performed by the department of cardiology within 24 hours of the POCUS, and the results are presented in the paper.  Results: There were 97 participant raters, including attendings, fellows, and resident physicians specializing in adult emergency medicine and two cardiologists. There was a fair degree of inter-rater agreement among all participants in interpreting whether tamponade physiology was present or not. This low level of agreement persisted across self-reported training levels and self-reported POCUS expertise, even at the expert level in both emergency medicine and cardiology specialties. According to the results of our study, there appears to be a low level of agreement in the interpretation of cardiac tamponade in adult patients. The lack of agreement persisted across specialties, self-reported training levels, and self-reported ultrasonographic expertise. This low level of agreement seen among both specialists indicates that emergency physicians are not limited in their ability to determine cardiac tamponade on POCUS. This highlights the technical nature of POCUS clips and strengthens the importance of physical exam findings when diagnosing cardiac tamponade in emergency department patients. Further research utilizing POCUS for the diagnosis of tamponade is warranted."

    "abstract": "Ingested foreign objects that become trapped in the upper aerodigestive tract is a common issue that arises in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery practice. In these circumstances, it is advised to explore the neck using an external method to remove the item. However, locating the foreign body might be challenging. Not all metallic foreign body (MFB) patients require surgery, especially those without symptoms or complications. The standard X-ray and CT images are routinely examined for preoperative assessment and localization. Removal can be accomplished via flexible pharyngo-laryngoscopy or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Fluoroscopy is a widely accessible, minimally invasive, but underutilized tool during procedures. It offers an accurate intraoperative assessment of the foreign body in real-time. To allow the planning of a secure extraction pathway, the target should be radiopaque. In this report, we present three unique cases in which we used fluoroscopic imaging for guidance to remove a foreign body in the head and neck region in Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In the first case, a young male presented with a history of foreign body sensation and odynophagia in the throat after eating a (shawarma) sandwich. In the second case, a six-year-old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with epistaxis after being exposed to an air gun shot to his face. In the third case, a 40- year-old male presented after exposure to an air gun shot to the neck. After identification of the foreign body, all three patients were referred to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck. After radiological images have been done to confirm the presence of foreign objects, all three had a minimally invasive procedure to remove the metallic foreign bodies under fluoroscopic guidance without needing extensive surgery. All the procedures went well with no immediate complications with discharge on the same day. Fluoroscopy-guided removal of foreign bodies related to metabolic forging is a promising technique with several advantages, including real-time visualization, reduced invasiveness, and shorter recovery times. However, it is essential to weigh the benefits against the risks associated with radiation exposure and inherent limitations in detecting non-metallic objects. Further research and clinical studies are needed to optimize this technique and establish evidence-based guidelines for its application in the field of metabolic forging bodies."

Morbidity and mortality are especially high in those with risk factors, which include diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease, recent myocardial infarction, and rheumatic autoimmune diseases, among others. We present the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian woman diagnosed with AMI. The patient presented acutely to the emergency department after nine episodes of vomiting and was admitted to the surgical floor the same day for an emergent exploratory laparotomy. She presented acutely with an atypical presentation and without any progressive symptoms, despite various comorbidities. This patient was classified as \"very high risk\", but she had not been on any medications or monitored for any of her comorbidities. We highlight the essential and multifaceted role of family medicine physicians, also known as primary care physicians (PCPs), in the prevention of bowel ischemia and recommend the use of routine outpatient monitoring with clinical examination, blood testing, and imaging. These, along with a high index of suspicion, have clinical utility in preventing hospitalization, surgical intervention (bowel resection), and other serious sequelae of AMI. Timely detection, management, and specialist referrals from a family medicine physician can lower the overall burden on healthcare resources and personnel."

Both scores were used to calculate the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) for predicting the patient outcome in a case of trauma. This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study was carried out at the trauma centre of a tertiary care institute and included patients of either sex, age ≥18 years, and ISS ≥15. A total of 2084 cases of trauma over a period of 18 months were assessed, and 96 cases of blunt trauma meeting the inclusion criteria were studied. Patients injured in road traffic accidents constituted the maximum caseload. Out of a sample size of 96 patients with ISS ≥15, 77 died during the treatment and 19 survived. The ISS ranged from 15 to 66, with a mean ± SD score of 27.48 ± 8.79. Non-survivors had a statistically higher significant ISS than survivors (p<0.001). The RTS ranged from <1 to 7.84, with a mean ± SD score of 4.52 ± 2.08. Non-survivors had low RTS (RTS <5, n=52) compared to survivors, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The mean ± SD TRISS (Ps) score was 0.69 ± 2.288. In the non-survivor (NS) group, 15 patients had TRISS (Ps) between 0.26-0.50, followed by 0.51-0.75 (n=18), 0.76-0.90 (n=12), and 0.90-0.95 (n=11). While 16 survivors had TRISS (Ps) between 0.96 and 1, a statistically significant association was found between TRISS and patient outcome (p-value <0.001). On the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the sensitivity of TRISS (94.7%) and RTS was found to be comparable (94.7%), whereas ISS was less sensitive (36.8%) in predicting the patient outcome. RTS (79.2%) and TRISS (76.6%) scores were more specific than ISS (5.2%) for outcome analysis. The TRISS score is useful in the management of trauma patients as it can satisfactorily predict mortality in a case of trauma. The trauma scores are of immense help in determining the nature of injury in medicolegal cases."

    "abstract": "Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion (HPE) is a rare but life-threatening diagnosis that may occur after thoracic trauma. Previous reports have concentrated on delayed HPE in those who did not require initial surgical intervention for their traumatic injuries. In this report, we identify and characterize the phenomenon of HPE after emergent thoracic surgery for trauma. This is a retrospective review of patients who required emergent thoracic surgery for trauma at a level 1 trauma center from 2017 to 2021. Using the institutional trauma database, demographics, injury characteristics, and outcomes were compared between patients with HPE and those without HPE after thoracic surgery for trauma. Ninety-one patients were identified who underwent emergent thoracic surgery for trauma. Most were young men who sustained a penetrating thoracic injury. Seven patients (7.7%) went on to develop HPE. Patients who developed HPE were younger (18 vs. 32 years, p=0.034), required bilateral anterolateral thoracotomy (85% vs. 7%, p<0.001), and were more likely to have pulmonary injuries (100% vs. 52.4%, p<0.001). Five patients with HPE survived to hospital discharge. The two patients with HPE who died were both coagulopathic and had HPE diagnosed within 4 days of injury. The median time to HPE diagnosis in survivors was 24 days with four of five HPE survivors on therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of diagnosis. HPE may occur after emergent thoracic surgery for trauma. Those at highest risk of HPE include younger patients with bilateral thoracotomy incisions and pulmonary injuries. Early HPE, clinical signs of tamponade, and/or coagulopathy in patients with HPE portend a worse prognosis. Surgeons and trauma team members caring for patients after emergent thoracic exploration for trauma should be aware of this potentially devastating complication and should consider postoperative echocardiography in high-risk patients."

O tipo de divergência mais incidente foi a não descrita pelo ME, mas descrita pelo radiologista. A chance de haver divergência em um caso de politrauma é 4,93 vezes maior em relação ao caso de somente trauma contuso em um segmento. Foi encontrada também uma diferença estatisticamente relevante no tempo de internamento dos pacientes que tiveram interpretações divergentes das tomografias. o estudo encontrou uma taxa de divergência relativamente alta entre o laudo do ME e o laudo oficial do radiologista. Contudo, menos de 4% dessas foram consideradas como clinicamente relevantes, indicando a capacidade dos ME em interpretar os exames de imagem de forma satisfatória."

    "abstract": "Isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (ISMAD) is rare, with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to acute intestinal ischemia. Risk factors for ISMAD include hypertension, atherosclerosis, abnormal elastic fibers, and pregnancy. In the present case, blunt trauma, which has not been previously reported, was suggested as a risk factor. A 46-year-old man was brought to the emergency room after he was found unconscious after a motor vehicle collision. At presentation, he had no abdominal symptoms; however, on the fourth day of admission, he presented with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed an ISMAD with associated intestinal ischemia and necrosis; hence, emergency surgery was performed. Herein, we report a case of ISMAD caused by blunt abdominal trauma."

The patient was not hemodynamically compromised and was conservatively managed. Urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy showed no source of bleeding. Abdominal CT demonstrated three mural nodular lesions up to 2cm in the mid jejunum with hypervascular characteristics in arterial phase without active bleeding in venous phase. Angiography (Figure 1A) revealed three tumours with neo-angiogenesis and no active bleeding. Each lesion was stained with methylene blue and followed by embolization with coils. Exploratory laparotomy (Figure 1B) showed the three nodules marked by angiography. Intestinal resection of the affected segment was performed. Histopathological study proved the diagnosis of suspicion (Figure 2)."

    "abstract": "In this case report, we describe isolated left ventricular cardiac tamponade, a rare complication of cardiac surgery, diagnosed on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in the emergency department (ED). To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a diagnosis made on ED bedside ultrasound. Our patient was a young adult female with a history of recent mitral valve replacement who presented to the ED with dyspnea and was found to have a large loculated pericardial effusion causing left ventricular diastolic collapse. Rapid diagnosis via POCUS in the ED allowed for expedited definitive treatment by cardiothoracic surgery in the operative room and emphasizes the importance of a standard 5-view cardiac POCUS examination when post-cardiac surgery patients present to the ED."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency encountered almost in every casualty. Though adhesions, hernias and malignancies are the common causes of obstruction, various articles describe unusual causes of intestinal obstruction which needs timely surgical interventions to prevent morbidity and mortality. In this case report we present the history of a 50 year old sub-fertile woman who presented with features of intestinal obstruction and confirmed radiologically with both plain x-ray and computed tomography. After conservative management and as the imaging didn't show the cause of obstruction, exploratory laparotomy was performed. There we found have encircling of left fallopian tube around mid-ileum with gangrenous part. Left salphingectomy and bowel resection with side-to-side anastomosis resulted in a favorable outcome. Intestinal obstruction can compromise blood flow to bowel loops leading to gangrene, perforation and death. Awareness, early recognition and timely intervention in intestinal obstruction is mandatory to prevent poor outcomes, especially in cases of unknown cause and not responding to conservative management. The real surgical challenge is not the decision whether to perform surgery, but the decision when and how to perform it."

Our study aims to raise awareness about this rare disease and its long-term outcomes. We retrospectively evaluated patients with signet-ring cell colon adenocarcinoma. Six patients, three boys and three girls, with a mean age of 14.83 (range, 13-17 years), presented with signs of intesti-nal obstruction and were diagnosed with signet-ring cell colon adenocarcinoma. All patients had air-fluid levels on abdominal X-ray. Abdominal ultrasonography of all patients revealed subileus. Abdominal computed tomography was performed in five patients, and pre-operative colonoscopy was conducted in two patients before the emergency intervention. All of the patients underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy with the preliminary diagnosis of acute abdomen. In two patients, debulking surgery followed by a stoma was performed. The remaining four patients were treated with anastomosis following intestinal resection. All girls had metastases on the ovary. One of the patients died due to the burden of multiple metastases in the early period, and three died in the sixth post-operative year. We have been following the remaining two patients since then. Although signet-ring cell carcinomas (SRCCs) are rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen and intestinal obstruction in pediatric patients. Despite early diagnosis and treatment, SRCC has a poor prognosis in the pediatric population."

This report illustrates the case of a 46-year-old African American woman who presented with a rare case of small bowel obstruction (SBO) two years post-LAGB placement. SBO, in this case, was a result of LAGB connecting tube intertwinement within the mesentery, accompanied by adhesions. The patient was diagnosed clinically and radiologically by computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed high-grade SBO. Initially, an exploratory laparoscopy was conducted, which soon transformed into an exploratory laparotomy when the cause of obstruction was seen to be the intertwinement of the connecting tube of the gastric band with the mesentery. With the rise of bariatric procedures to combat the epidemic of obesity in American society, this rare complication secondary to one of the most widely performed procedures beckons the attention of bariatric surgeons, emergency personnel, and device manufacturers."

CT angiogram of the chest revealed a large pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram confirmed tamponade physiology despite her being haemodynamically stable. She had an emergency pericardiocentesis which revealed evidence of a haemorrhagic pericardial effusion. However, the patient was still symptomatic after treatment and had to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with a pericardial window and chest tube. Postoperatively, her fevers resolved. Pan-culture was initially negative, and all antibiotics were discontinued. Acid-fast bacilli cultures later grew Mycobacterium avium complex. She continued to have chest discomfort postoperatively, but follow-up CT of the chest 3 months postoperatively showed continued resolution of her pericardial effusion. The patient's symptoms improved, and she has had no recurrence of effusion without the need for anti-tuberculosis drugs."

    "abstract": "Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome. Sometimes it is the cause of obstruction in the duodenum. In SMA syndrome, the acute angulation of the SMA against the abdominal aorta can prevent duodenal contents from draining into the jejunum (upper small intestine); hence inadequate intake of nutrition leads to weight loss and malnutrition. This is primarily attributed to the loss of intervening pad of mesenteric fat tissue due to various debilitating conditions. Abnormal connections between the intra-abdominal gastrointestinal tracts and skin over the abdomen are known as enterocutaneous fistulas (ECF).  In this case report, a 37-year-old woman with a history of chronic dull pain in the upper abdominal region over the last seven months, who also complained of bloating, infrequent vomiting, nausea, and upper abdominal fullness for the same amount of time, was seen in the emergency room. Her symptoms had deteriorated by the time she approached the hospital. Additionally, she reports having had a foul-smelling, purulent discharge for the past five years right below the umbilicus. Upon close investigation, it was determined to be feces, and it was later discovered to be a low-output enterocutaneous fistula. She describes having an exploratory laparotomy and adhesiolysis for an intra-abdominal abscess and an acute intestinal obstruction caused by adhesions. This case emphasizes the provocation given a diagnosis of SMA syndrome with enterocutaneous fistula and demands increased awareness of this entity. This will ameliorate early identification to reduce immaterial tests and irrelevant treatments."

    "abstract": "To compare the prehospital treatment modalities and intervention regimens for major trauma patients with comparable injury patterns between Austria and Germany. This analysis is based on data retrieved from the TraumaRegister DGU®. Data included severely injured trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16, an age ≥ 16 years, and who were primarily admitted to an Austrian (n = 4186) or German (n = 41,484) level I trauma center (TC) from 2008 to 2017. Investigated endpoints included prehospital times and interventions performed until final hospital admission. The cumulative time for transportation from the site of the accident to the hospital did not significantly differ between the countries (62 min in Austria, 65 min in Germany). Overall, 53% of all trauma patients in Austria were transported to the hospital with a helicopter compared to 37% in Germany (p < 0.001). The rate of intubation was 48% in both countries, the number of chest tubes placed (5.7% Germany, 4.9% Austria), and the frequency of administered catecholamines (13.4% Germany, 12.3% Austria) were comparable (Φ = 0.00). Hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure, BP ≤ 90 mmHg) upon arrival in the TC was higher in Austria (20.6% vs. 14.7% in Germany; p < 0.001). A median of 500 mL of fluid was administered in Austria, whereas in Germany 1000 mL was infused (p < 0.001). Patient demographics did not reveal a relationship (Φ = 0.00) between both countries, and the majority of patients sustained a blunt trauma (96%). The observed ASA score of 3-4 was 16.8% in Germany versus 11.9% in Austria. Significantly more helicopter EMS transportations (HEMS) were carried out in Austria. The authors suggest implementing international guidelines to explicitly use the HEMS system for trauma patients only a) for the rescue/care of people who have had an accident or are in life-threatening situations, b) for the transport of emergency patients with ISS > 16, c) for transportation of rescue or recovery personnel to hard to reach regions or, d) for the transport of medicinal products, especially blood products, organ transplants or medical devices. HINTERGRUND/ZIELE: Vergleich der präklinischen Behandlungsmodalitäten und Interventionsschemata für schwer traumatisierte Patienten mit vergleichbaren Verletzungsmustern zwischen Österreich und Deutschland. Diese Analyse basiert auf Daten aus dem TraumaRegister DGU®. Die Daten umfassten schwer verletzte Traumapatienten mit einem Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16, einem Alter ≥ 16 Jahre und primärer Aufnahme in ein österreichisches (n = 4186) oder deutsches (n = 41.484) Level I Trauma Center (TC) von 2008 bis 2017. Untersuchte Endpunkte umfassten präklinische Zeiten und durchgeführte Eingriffe bis zur endgültigen Krankenhauseinweisung. Die kumulierte Zeit für den Transport vom Unfallort zum Krankenhaus unterschied sich nicht signifikant zwischen den Ländern (62 min in AUT, 65 min in GER). Insgesamt wurden 53 % aller Traumapatienten in AUT mit einem Hubschrauber ins Krankenhaus transportiert, verglichen mit 37 % in GER (p < 0,001). Die Intubationsrate – 48 % in beiden Ländern, die Anzahl platzierter Thoraxdrainagen (5,7 % GER, 4,9 % AUT) und die Häufigkeit der verabreichten Katecholamine (13,4 % GER, 12,3 % AUT) waren vergleichbar (Φ = 0,00). Die hämodynamische Instabilität (systolischer Blutdruck (BP) ≤ 90 mmHg) bei Ankunft im TC war in AUT höher (20,6 % vs. 14,7 % bei GER; p < 0,001). In AUT wurden im Median 500 ml Flüssigkeit verabreicht, während in GER 1000 ml infundiert wurden (p < 0,001). Die demografischen Daten der Patienten zeigten keinen Zusammenhang (Φ = 0,00) zwischen beiden Ländern, und die Mehrheit der Patienten erlitt ein stumpfes Trauma (96 %). ASA-Score von 3–4 betrug 16,8 % in Deutschland (GER) gegenüber 11,9 % in Österreich (AUT). In AUT wurden deutlich mehr Helikopter-EMS-Transporte (HEMS) durchgeführt. Die Autoren schlagen vor, eine internationale Richtlinie zu implementieren, um das HEMS-System explizit nur für Traumapatienten a) für die Rettung/Versorgung von verunfallten oder in lebensbedrohlichen Situationen befindlichen Personen, b) für den Transport von Notfallpatienten mit ISS > 16, c) für den Transport von Rettungs- oder Bergungspersonal in schwer zugängliche Regionen oder d) für den Transport von Arzneimitteln, insbesondere Blutprodukten, Organtransplantaten oder Medizinprodukten einzusetzen."

    "abstract": "In the emergency setting, right lower quadrant pain is a common clinical scenario. While acute appendicitis is the most relevant cause, there is a wide differential diagnosis. Valentino syndrome is a rare entity in which gastric or duodenal perforation, usually secondary to peptic ulcer disease, presents clinically with right lower quadrant pain mimicking acute appendicitis. It has its origins in Rudolph Valentino, a famous American actor who died of sepsis following an undiagnosed perforated ulcer after an appendectomy. Nowadays, radiological images play a crucial role in this pathology, historically diagnosed using exploratory laparotomy. Through a clinical case and a review of the literature, we aim to describe the historical evolution of Valentino's syndrome, illustrate its clinical and radiological characteristics and highlight the increasing role of imaging, particularly computed tomography, in its early prospective diagnosis and in guiding targeted treatment. Finally, it is important to consider this pathology when assessing acute abdominal patients with coexisting pneumoperitoneum and appendicitis. En el ámbito de urgencias el dolor en fosa ilíaca derecha es un cuadro clínico frecuente. Aunque la apendicitis aguda es la causa más relevante, existen otros diagnósticos diferenciales. El síndrome de Valentino es una patología infrecuente en la que una perforación gástrica o duodenal, generalmente secundaria a enfermedad ulcerosa péptica, se presenta clínicamente con dolor en el cuadrante inferior derecho, simulando una apendicitis aguda.

Actualmente, las imágenes radiológicas tienen un papel fundamental en esta patología, históricamente diagnosticada mediante laparotomía exploradora. A través de un caso clínico y la revisión bibliográfica, nuestro objetivo es describir la evolución del síndrome de Valentino, ilustrar sus características clínico-radiológicas y destacar el papel cada vez más importante de las imágenes, especialmente la tomografía computada, para su diagnóstico prospectivo temprano y para orientar el tratamiento dirigido.

Many complications can occur secondary to complicated appendicitis including abscess formation, gangrene, sepsis, and perforation, rarely, leading to abdominal wall necrotizing fasciitis. The incidence of necrotizing fasciitis as a complication of ruptured appendicitis is extremely uncommon. The formation of an enterocutaneous fistula leading to this complication further emphasizes the rarity of such occurrence with few cases reported in the literature. Herein, we present a case of abdominal wall necrotizing fasciitis in a 72-year-old female presenting to the local emergency room with complaints of severe suprapubic abdominal pain associated with abdominal distension and acute onset foul-smelling drainage. Physical exam was significant for suprapubic and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness with associated large indurated tender lesion and purulent weeping with large ecchymosis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed extensive subcutaneous emphysema, a large cavity with layering fluid extending into the peritoneal space, and a possible fistula formation between the intra-abdominal cavity and subcutaneous tissue. Following the diagnosis of probable necrotizing fasciitis secondary to fistula formation, the patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy and extensive debridement of necrotic tissue. In this report, we take the opportunity to highlight the importance of promptly recognizing and treating this uncommon complication and maintaining a high level of suspicion to prevent life-threatening consequences."

Patients with such abnormality usually exhibit no symptoms. Moreover, this is a lethal condition due to the high probability of splenic rupture accompanied by shock. We present a case of a 29-year-old Arab female who was admitted to the hospital with severe upper abdominal pain that started 1 week from the date of admission, associated with nausea, anorexia, low-grade fever, and vomiting, with no past medical history or comorbidities. A computerized tomography scan with contrast showed intraperitoneal free fluid along with multiple hypodense splenic cysts. Hence, an emergent exploratory laparotomy with splenectomy was performed. Splenic peliosis was confirmed by the histopathological examination. Further investigations are warranted if peliosis is confirmed in one organ, for example, the liver, to detect its presence in any other potential organs that can be affected by peliosis. Splenic peliosis is extraordinarily rare. Furthermore, such a disease has no established management plan. Definitive treatment is surgical. Many aspects of splenic peliosis remain puzzling requiring more research in the near future."

The aim of this study is to identify the outcomes of traumatic cardiac arrest in pediatric patients within the local community and report the causes and resuscitation management for the defined cases. This was a retrospectively conducted cohort study that took place in King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) and King Abdullah Specialized Children Hospital (KASCH) from 2005 to 2021, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study population involved pediatric patients aged 14 years or less who were admitted to our Emergency Department (ED) and had a traumatic cardiac arrest in the ED. There were 26,510 trauma patients, and only 56 were eligible for inclusion. More than half (60.71%, n= 34) of the patients were males. Patients aged four years or less constituted 51.79% (n= 29) of the included cases. The majority of patients were Saudis (89.29%, n= 50). The majority of the patients had cardiac arrest prior to ED admission (78.57%, n= 44). The majority (89.29%, n= 50) had a GCS of 3 at ED arrival. The most frequently observed first cardiac arrest rhythm was asystole, followed by pulseless electrical activity and ventricular fibrillation, accounting for 74.55%, 23.64%, and 1.82%, respectively. Pediatric TCA is high acuity. Children who experience TCA have dreadful outcomes, and survivors can suffer serious neurological impairments.

The case indicates the need for reviewing the information on ovarian teratomas, as the symptoms are vague, and, therefore, diagnosis and treatment had to be structured accordingly. A 60-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with acute lower abdominal pain. She experienced weight loss and increased abdominal girth. Pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography revealed a 14-cm pelvic tumor. Laboratory examination revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 12620/μL, segment: 87.7%) and high levels of C-reactive protein (18.2 mg/dL). Elevated levels of the tumor marker cancer antigen 19-9 (367.8 U/mL, normal value < 35 U/mL) were also noted. Due to the impression of a ruptured tubo-ovarian abscess or a tumor with malignancy, she immediately underwent an exploratory laparotomy. A ruptured ovarian tumor with fat balls, hair strands, cartilage, and yellowish fluid was observed on the right side. Right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. A pathological examination revealed a mature cystic teratoma. The patient recovered after surgery and was discharged on post-operative day three. No antibiotics were administered. This case illustrates the differential diagnosis of an ovarian tumor. Therefore, surgery is the mainstay for treating a ruptured teratoma."

To evaluate the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients under DOACs with cardiac tamponade. We retrospectively identified 11 patients treated with DOACs admitted with pericardial tamponade in our cardiology unit during 2018-2021. The mean age was 84 ± 4 years; 7 males. Atrial fibrillation was the indication for anticoagulation in all cases. DOACs included apixaban (8 patients), dabigatran (2 patients), and rivaroxaban (1 patient). Urgent pericardiocentesis via a subxiphoid approach under echocardiography guidance was successfully performed in 10 patients. One patient was treated with urgent surgical drainage with a pericardial window. Reversal of anticoagulation using prothrombin complex concentrate and idarucizumab was given before the procedure to 6 patients treated with apixaban and one patient treated with dabigatran. One patient, initially treated with urgent pericardiocentesis, underwent pericardial window surgery due to re-accumulation of blood in the pericardium. The pericardial fluid analysis demonstrated hemopericardium. Cytology tests were negative for malignant cells in all cases. Discharge diagnoses regarding the cause of hemopericardium included pericarditis (3 patients) and idiopathic (8 patients). Medical therapy included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (1 patient), colchicine (3 patients), and steroids (3 patients). No patient died during hospitalization. Hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade is a rare complication of DOACs. We found good short-term prognosis following pericardiocentesis."

However, the potential benefits of this approach remain subject of debate. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of REBOA and RT for traumatic cardiac arrest. A planned secondary analysis of the United States Department of Defense-funded Emergent Truncal Hemorrhage Control study was performed. Between 2017 and 2018, a prospective observational study of noncompressible torso hemorrhage was conducted at six Level I trauma centers. Patients were dichotomized by REBOA or RT, and baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between groups. A total of 454 patients were enrolled in the primary study, of which 72 patients were included in the secondary analysis (26 underwent REBOA and 46 underwent resuscitative thoracotomy). Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta patients were older, had a greater body mass index, and were less likely to be the victims of penetrating trauma. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta patients also had less severe abdominal injuries and more severe extremity injuries, although the overall injury severity scores were similar. There was no difference in mortality between groups (88% vs. 93%, p = 0.767). However, time to aortic occlusion was longer in REBOA patients (7 vs. 4 minutes, p = 0.001) and they required more transfusions of red blood cells (4.5 vs. 2.5 units, p = 0.007) and plasma (3 vs. 1 unit, p = 0.032) in the emergency department. After adjusted analysis, mortality remained similar between groups (RR, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.12, p = 0.304). Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta and RT were associated with similar survival after traumatic cardiac arrest, although time to successful aortic occlusion was longer in the REBOA group.

    "abstract": "Blunt cervical vascular injury (BCVI) is a non-penetrating trauma to the carotid and/or vertebral vessels following a direct injury to the neck or by the shearing of the cervical vessels. Despite its potentially life-threatening nature, important clinical features of BCVI such as typical patterns of co-occurring injuries for each trauma mechanism are not well known. To address this knowledge gap, we described the characteristics of patients with BCVI to identify the pattern of co-occurring injuries by common trauma mechanisms. This is a descriptive study using a Japanese nationwide trauma registry from 2004 through 2019. We included patients aged ≥13 years presenting to the emergency department (ED) with BCVI, defined as a blunt trauma to any of the following vessels: common/internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, vertebral artery, external jugular vein, and internal jugular vein. We delineated characteristics of each BCVI classified according to three damaged vessels (common/internal carotid artery, vertebral artery, and others). In addition, we applied network analysis to unravel patterns of co-occurring injuries among patients with BCVI by four common trauma mechanisms (car accident, motorcycle/bicycle accident, simple fall, and fall from a height). Among 311,692 patients who visited the ED for blunt trauma, 454 (0.1%) patients had BCVI. Patients with common/internal carotid artery injuries presented to the ED with severe symptoms (e.g., the median Glasgow Coma Scale was 7) and had high in-hospital mortality (45%), while patients with vertebral artery injuries presented with relatively stable vital signs. Network analysis showed that head-vertebral-cervical spine injuries were common across four trauma mechanisms (car accident, motorcycle/bicycle accident, simple fall, and fall from a height), with co-occurring injuries of the cervical spine and vertebral artery being the most common injuries due to falls. In addition, common/internal carotid artery injuries were associated with thoracic and abdominal injuries in patients with car accidents. Based on analyses of a nationwide trauma registry, we found that patients with BCVI had distinct patterns of co-occurring injuries by four trauma mechanisms. Our observations provide an important basis for the initial assessment of blunt trauma and could support the management of BCVI."

A systematic PubMed and Scopus search was conducted. The mean age of the patients was 51.7 years. The majority of patients were of female gender. An emergency presentation was noted in 30 out of 85 patients, having abdominal pain as main symptom. The principal reason for splenectomy were traffic accidents. The time span between splenectomy and the initial symptoms ranged between 1 and 57 years. The most frequent symptom at presentation of pelvic splenosis was abdominal pain. Almost a quarter of the included patients were without any symptom. Presence of extrapelvic splenosis was de-scripted in almost half of the included patients. With regards to the type of treatment provided, exploratory laparotomy, laparoscopic surgical exploration / laparoscopy, robotic removal of splenium and watchful waiting, were performed in 35 (41.2%), 32 (37.6%), 3 (3.5%) and 15 (16.3%) patients, respectively. No fatality was reported. Pelvic splenosis is a rare clinical condition. It may mimic several clinical conditions and mislead diagnosis. The clinical history of splenectomy for trauma or different other reasons may es-tablish diagnosis and exclude other morbidities. Excision and complete removal of pelvic splenosis nodules is not always necessary and it depends on the clinical symptomatology. Careful imaging and precise assessment with the assistance of nuclear medicine may lead to correct diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgical interventions."

    "abstract": "An elderly man presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and significant weight loss. Blood tests revealed anemia and elevated inflammatory markers, and chest imaging showed a massive left pleural effusion. During hospitalization, he developed subacute cardiac tamponade, and pericardiocentesis was performed. Further imaging revealed a primary malignant cardiac tumor with extensive infiltration of the cardiac tissue, and biopsy was deemed impossible due to the tumor's location. The most likely diagnosis was angiosarcoma. The cardiac surgery team evaluated the case and considered it inoperable due to the tumor's extensive infiltration. The patient is currently under the regular care of a palliative care team. This case underscores the difficulties of diagnosing primary cardiac tumors, particularly in elderly patients with comorbidities. Despite advances in imaging and surgical techniques, the prognosis for malignant cardiac tumors remains poor."

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Violence is the leading cause of mortality in Honduras. However, the incidence and impact of TBI in this low-middle income country (LMIC) is unknown. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of TBI in Honduras, as captured by an injury surveillance tool in the country's major referral center. A cross sectional review of all TBI-related emergency department visits at the main referral hospital in Honduras from January to December 2013 was conducted. The calculation of descriptive statistics from Injury Surveillance System (InSS) data was performed. Of 17,971 total injuries seen in 2013, 20% were traumatic brain injuries (n=3,588). The main mechanisms of injury were falls (41.11%), road traffic accidents (23.91%), blunt trauma (20.82%), penetrating knife injuries (5.85%), and firearm injuries (2.26%). Most TBI were classified as mild; 99.69% (Glasgow Coma Scale=15). Emergency room mortality was low (1.11%). The modified Kampala Trauma Score median was 8 (interquartile range 7-8). Mild TBI accounts for a significant percentage of all injuries presenting to a high-volume referral center in Honduras in 2013. Despite the high incidence of violence in this country, most TBI were accidental, secondary to road traffic accidents and falls. Further research is required with more recent data as well as with prospective data collection methods."

    "abstract": "The neck is a critical region containing many essential structures. Before surgical intervention, it is crucial to assess the adequacy of the airway and circulation, as well as the presence of any skeletal or neurological damage. Here, we present a case of a 33-year-old male with a background of amphetamine abuse who presented to our emergency department with a penetrating neck injury just below the mandible at the hypopharynx level, resulting in an upper zone II neck injury with complete separation of the airway. The patient was taken immediately to the operating room for exploration. Airways were managed by direct intubation, hemostasis was maintained, and the open laryngeal injury was repaired. After the surgery, this patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for two days and discharged after a satisfactory full recovery. Penetrating neck injuries are rare but often fatal. Advanced trauma life support guidelines emphasize the importance of managing the airway as the first action. Providing multidisciplinary care before, during, and after trauma can help prevent and treat such incidents."

    "abstract": "Focusing on potential missed injury rates and sensitivity of low-risk of injury predictions, we sought to evaluate the accuracy of physician gestalt in predicting clinically significant injury (CSI) in the abdomen and pelvis among blunt trauma patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). We collected gestalt data on physicians caring for adult blunt trauma patients who received abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) at three Level I and one Level II trauma centers. The primary outcome of CSI was defined as injury on abdominal/pelvic CT requiring hospitalization or intervention. Physicians evaluating trauma patients estimated the likelihood of CSI prior to abdominal/pelvic CT review (response choices: <2%, 2%-10%, 11%-20%, 21%-40%, >40%). We evaluated potential missed injury rates (prevalence of CSI) and sensitivity for prediction categories, as well as calibration and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for overall physician gestalt. Of 2030 patients, 402 (20%) had an injury on abdominal/pelvic CT and 270 (13%) had CSI. The <2% risk of CSI gestalt cutoff had a potential missed injury rate of 5.6% and a sensitivity of 95.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.7%-97.3%). The 0%-10% cutoff of CSI gestalt had a potential missed injury rate of 6.3% (95% CI, 5.0%-7.9%) and a sensitivity of 75.2% (95% CI 69.5%-80.1%). With an overall AUROC of 0.699 (95% CI 0.679-0.719), physician gestalt was moderately accurate and calibrated for the midranges of predicted risk but poorly calibrated at the extremes. Physician gestalt for the prediction of adult abdominal and pelvic CSI is moderately accurate and calibrated. However, the potential missed CSI rate and low sensitivity of the low perceived risk of injury cutoffs indicate that gestalt by itself is insufficient to direct selective abdominal/pelvic CT use in adult blunt trauma patient evaluation."

    "abstract": "Hepatogastric fistula following pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) is a rare and fatal complication, and only a handful of cases have been reported without co-existing comorbidities of Brugarda syndrome. A 22-year-old male presented to the emergency room with a known case of Brugarda pattern ECG with chief complaints of on-and-off abdominal pain and fever for 2 weeks and shortness of breath for one day. On evaluation, echocardiography showed a clot in the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium (RA), and on computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed a liver abscess with transmural gastric perforation. During, an exploratory laparotomy where a fistula joining the left lobe of the liver and stomach was detected, and an emergency excision was done. The patient was shifted to the ICU and later developed septic shock, which was managed medically. Usually, thrombosis of the portal vein and the hepatic vein is a very common complication of a PLA but vascular complications like IVC, RA thrombosis, and hepatogastric fistula have been reported rarely. Our case is peculiar hepatogastric fistulization along with IVC/RA clots in a patient with Brugarda pattern ECG. The typical clinical manifestation of a patient with hepatogenic fistula is absent in our patient and presented with an on-off type of fever, epigastric pain, and shortness of breath and was managed surgically. Hepatogasric fistula, thrombosis of the IVC, and RA are a rare complications of PLA. The patient with Brugarda syndrome is at high risk as its clinical manifestation gets exaggerated during sepsis."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a core component of emergency medicine (EM) residency training. No standardized competency-based tool has gained widespread acceptance. The ultrasound competency assessment tool (UCAT) was recently derived and validated. We sought to externally validate the UCAT in a 3-year EM residency program. This was a convenience sample of PGY-1 to -3 residents. Utilizing the UCAT and an entrustment scale, as described in the original study, six different evaluators split into two groups graded residents in a simulated scenario involving a patient with blunt trauma and hypotension. Residents were asked to perform and interpret a focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) examination and apply the findings to the simulated scenario. Demographics, prior POCUS experience, and self-assessed competency were collected. Each resident was evaluated simultaneously by three different evaluators with advanced ultrasound training utilizing the UCAT and entrustment scales. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between evaluators was calculated for each assessment domain; analysis of variance was used to compare UCAT performance and PGY level and prior POCUS experience. Thirty-two residents (14 PGY-1, nine PGY-2, and nine PGY-3) completed the study. Overall, ICC was 0.9 for preparation, 0.57 for image acquisition, 0.3 for image optimization, and 0.46 for clinical integration. There was moderate correlation between number of FAST examinations performed and entrustment and UCAT composite scores. There was poor correlation between self-reported confidence and entrustment and UCAT composite scores. We had mixed results in our attempt to externally validate the UCAT with poor correlation between faculty and moderate to good correlation with faculty to diagnostic sonographer. More work is needed to validate the UCAT before adoption."

    "abstract": "Abdominal pregnancy is the rarest ectopic pregnancies, with an incidence of 1 per 10,000 live births, and life-threatening because the symptoms are not specific and diagnosis is made after abdominal pain, amenorrhea and vaginal bleeding occur. We present a rare case of abdominal pregnancy in a 31-year-old Indonesian woman with severe abdominal pain within 24 hours before hospital admission, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, dizziness and weakness. She felt the pain increasing since the last 2 weeks and limiting her movement. She has a history of a left tubal pregnancy 5 years ago. Ultrasonography examination revealed an ectopic pregnancy, and she was rushed to the operation room for emergency exploratory laparotomy. An abdominal pregnancy was found, located in the right adnexa with excessive fluid in cavum Douglass and a foetus in around 11-12 weeks of gestation accompanied by free fluid in the subdiaphragmatic, subhepatic and pelvic cavity. The surgery was a successful, four units of whole blood were transfused, and the patient was safely discharged from the hospital. The current concept on management of abdominal pregnancy supports immediate surgical intervention with pregnancy termination, as found in this case, because the patient's condition is hemodynamically unstable indicating hemorrhagic shock correlated with massive hemoperitoneum. A prompt diagnosis and good teamwork in treatment plays an important role for such a life-threatening condition to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality in a case of abdominal pregnancy."

    "abstract": "Bleeding in the postoperative period after cardiac surgery is relatively frequent, especially in patients with early anticoagulant therapy, as in the case of mechanical valve replacement. Diffuse hemopericardium is relatively easy to diagnose; however, loculated pericardial hematomas leading to hemodynamic collapse are relatively rare and their diagnosis is more challenging. This report is of a 75-year-old Asian woman who presented dyspnea, confusion and hemodynamic collapse related to loculated pericardial hematoma compressing the right atrium 3 days after mechanical aortic valve replacement. Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram performed as point-of-care approach showed right atrial compression, the aortic valve prosthesis had normal function. Surgical removal of the hematoma resulted in complete recovery. Loculated pericardial hematoma might lead to hemodynamic collapse. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is essential, also point-of-care echocardiography is essential for early recognition and prompt management in patients with critical hemodynamic condition."

Although fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is known to coexist in patients with SCAD, the vascular sites of FMD and their frequency have not yet been clarified. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 16 patients who were diagnosed with and treated for SCAD at our hospital between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2023. We have summarized their baseline and clinical characteristics and medical variables, including coronary and upper extremity angiography and in-hospital outcomes. One of our patients had concurrent cardiac tamponade requiring pericardial drainage, and another went into hemorrhage shock the following day from dissection of the gastric retroperitoneal artery. Characteristic angiographic features of partial or diffuse nonatherosclerotic stenosis were observed mainly in the distal parts of the coronary arteries or their branches. Notably, in six patients with SCAD who underwent upper extremity angiography, FMD of the brachial artery was revealed. For the first time, to our knowledge, we found a high prevalence of multifocal FMD of the brachial artery in patients with SCAD."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction due to external compression is a rare condition, and those caused by appendiceal neoplasms like low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms are extremely rare. A 67-year-old post-menopausal female, with no history of prior abdominal surgery, presented to the emergency room with constipation for 2 days, and peri-umbilical pain and non-projectile bilious vomiting for 19 h. There was mild abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness. After ultrasonography and Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, a provisional diagnosis of complete small bowel obstruction secondary to perforated mucinous neoplasm of the appendix was made. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed followed by ileo-cecal resection and ileocolic anastomosis. Intraoperative findings revealed bands extending from the appendix to the ileum forming a closed loop with gangrenous spots in the distal ileum and ascitic fluid with mucin. Later, histopathological examination findings were consistent with low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm (LAMN). We reviewed three cases of intestinal obstruction, caused by compression from a LAMN, including the presented case. Preoperative diagnosis of the cause of small intestinal obstruction on CT is sometimes challenging. Hence, in patients with intestinal obstruction with a transition point in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen on CT, a high index of suspicion for an appendiceal etiology is required. LAMN with an associated band should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in the patient presenting with symptoms of complete small intestinal obstruction without prior abdominal surgery."

    "abstract": "Traumatic aortic injury is a life-threatening condition usually followed by blunt trauma with damage at the thoracic aorta. Abdominal aortic injuries are rare and usually seen with seatbelt trauma. Timing and approach of treatment are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This case concerns a 66-year-old man with a high impact trauma after a fall from height. Upon presentation in our level two trauma center, he was conscious but hemodynamically unstable. Computer Tomography scan revealed multiple rib, spine and pelvic fractures with bilateral lung contusions warranting a transfer to a level one trauma center. However, an infrarenal aortic dissection with a retroperitoneal rupture and active bleeding necessitated acute surgical intervention. He was treated endovascularly with an off-the-shelf aortic stent graft which is meant for aortic aneurysm repair. Surgery was performed percutaneously under local anesthetic. Other fractures were treated conservatively. Postoperatively, the patient made a swift recovery without any complications in follow-up. As this case demonstrates, urgent endovascular repair of a traumatic infrarenal aortic injury can be done quickly with a minimally invasive approach with conventional stent graft systems thereby reducing the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with this life-threatening condition."

In addition to the S3 guideline \"Polytrauma\", which was published more than a decade ago, the S2K guideline \"Severe multiple trauma care in childhood\" was published in 2020. Accidents and especially the resulting traumatic brain injuries still represent the most frequent cause of death in children. While prehospital treatment according to Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS®) is basically analogous to that in adults which is based on the ABCDE concept (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure), knowledge of age-dependent anatomical-physiological characteristics is essential. For simplification, various tools and dosing aids, such as the pediatric emergency ruler and specific emergency tables, are available. Further treatment after initial preclinical care should take place in an interdisciplinary manner in designated pediatric trauma centers. Das kindliche Polytrauma ist eine seltene Entität mit etwa 380–550 Fällen pro Jahr bundesweit.

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrest following trauma is a leading cause of death, mandating urgent treatment. This study aimed to investigate and compare the incidence, prognostic factors, and survival between patients suffering from traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) and non-traumatic cardiac arrest (non-TCA). This cohort study included all patients suffering from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Denmark between 2016 and 2021. TCAs were identified in the prehospital medical record and linked to the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest registry. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were performed with 30-day survival as the primary outcome. A total of 30,215 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were included. Among those, 984 (3.3%) were TCA. TCA patients were younger and predominantly male (77.5% vs 63.6%, p =  < 0.01) compared to non-TCA patients. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 27.3% of cases vs 32.3% in non-TCA patients, p < 0.01, and 30-day survival was 7.3% vs 14.2%, p < 0.01. An initial shockable rhythm was associated with increased survival (aOR = 11.45, 95% CI [6.24 - 21.24] in TCA patients. When comparing TCA with non-TCA other trauma and penetrating trauma were associated with lower survival (aOR: 0.2, 95% CI [0.02-0.54] and aOR: 0.1, 95% CI [0.03 - 0.31], respectively. Non-TCA was associated with an aOR: 3.47, 95% CI [2.53 - 4,91]. Survival from TCA is lower than in non-TCA. TCA has different predictors of outcome compared to non-TCA, illustrating the differences regarding the aetiologies of cardiac arrest. Presenting with an initial shockable cardiac rhythm might be associated with a favourable outcome in TCA."

Its use in pediatric trauma has been shown to be safe when using leukoreduced, LTOWB with anti-A, anti-B antibody titers of <1:50. We set out to evaluate the safety, hemostatic potential, and impact on pediatric outcomes at a center using non-leukoreduced, LTOWB with anti-A, anti-B antibody titers of <1:200. Patients younger than 18 years, who received emergency-release, uncrossed matched blood, and presented to our trauma center from November 2017 to April 2021 were included. Patients were divided into those receiving any LTOWB and those receiving only RBC and or plasma (COMP). Primary outcome was 30-day survival. One hundred sixty-four patients received emergency release blood products. Of these, 73 received at least one unit of LTOWB. The LTOWB group were younger (14 years vs. 13 years), more likely to be male (87% vs. 49%), and to have sustained penetrating trauma (44% vs. 23%); all p < 0.05. Low-titer group O whole blood patients received more blood than their COMP counterparts prior to arrival. Serial hemolysis panels (K+, bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin) obtained at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours were similar between groups; all p > 0.05. There was no difference in survival by univariate analysis but after adjusting for inverse probability of treatment weights there was an observed association between WB administration and improved survival, with an odds ratio of 2.48 (1.15-5.47). Non-leukoreduced, LTOWB in anti-A/anti-B antibody titers of <1:200 appear safe in children and adolescents. While patients receiving LTOWB had more evidence of shock, higher torso injury severity, and received more prehospital blood products, there may be a mortality benefit with whole blood.

Initial COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Echocardiography identified features consistent with cardiac tamponade prompting pericardiocentesis. Over 1,000 ml of straw-coloured aspirate was drained with significant clinical improvement, and the patient was discharged with plans for urgent outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

This study reports on the experience and outcomes of a Level 1 trauma center that serves both an urban and a large rural population over a 20-year period to identify bypass outcomes and surveillance protocols. Database of a single vascular group at an academic center was queried for trauma patients requiring upper or lower extremity revascularization between January 1, 2002, and June 30, 2022. Patient demographics, indications, operative details, operative mortality, 30-day nonoperative morbidity, revisions, subsequent major amputations, and follow-up data were analyzed. A total of 223 revascularizations were performed, 161 (72%) lower and 62 (28%) upper extremities. One hundred sixty-seven patients (74.9%) were male, with a mean age of 39 years (range, 3-89 years). Comorbidities included hypertension (n = 34; 15.3%), diabetes (n = 6; 2.7%), and tobacco use (n = 40; 17.9%). Mean follow-up time was 23 months (range, 1-234 months), with 90 patients (40.4%) lost to follow-up. Mechanisms included blunt trauma (n = 106; 47.5%), penetrating trauma (n = 83; 37.2%), and operative trauma (n = 34; 15.3%). Bypass conduit was reversed vein (n= 171; 76.7%), prosthetic (n = 34; 15.2%), and orthograde vein (n = 11; 4.9%). Bypass inflow artery was superficial femoral (n = 66; 41.0%), above-knee popliteal (n = 28; 17.4%), and common femoral (n = 20; 12.4%) in the lower extremity, and brachial (n = 41; 66.1%), axillary (n = 10; 16.1%), and radial (n = 6; 9.7%) in the upper extremity. Lower extremity outflow artery was posterior tibial (n = 47; 29.2%), below-knee popliteal (n = 41; 25.5%), superficial femoral (n = 16; 9.9%), dorsalis pedis (n = 10; 6.2%), common femoral (n = 9; 5.6%), and above-knee popliteal (n = 10; 6.2%). Upper extremity outflow artery was brachial (n = 34; 54.8%), radial (n = 13; 21.0%), and ulnar (n = 13; 21.0%). Total operative mortality was nine patients (4.0%), all involving lower extremity revascularization. Thirty-day non-fatal complications included immediate bypass occlusion (n = 11; 4.9%), wound infection (n = 8; 3.6%), graft infection (n = 4; 1.8%), and lymphocele/seroma (n = 7; 3.1%). All major amputations (n = 13; 5.8%) were early and in the lower extremity bypass group. Late revisions in the lower and upper extremity groups were 14 (8.7%) and four (6.4%), respectively. Revascularization for extremity trauma can be performed with excellent limb salvage rates and has demonstrated long-term durability with low limb loss and bypass revision rates. The poor compliance with long-term surveillance is concerning and may require adjustment in patient retention protocols; however, emergent returns for bypass failure are extremely low in our experience."

Their presentation is often indistinguishable from true penile fractures (TPF). This overlapping of clinical presentation, and lack of knowledge about FPF, can lead surgeons often to proceed directly to surgical exploration without further examinations. The aim of this study was to define a typical presentation of false penile fractures (FPF) emergency, identifying in absence of \"snap\" sound, slow detumescence, penile shaft ecchymosis, and penile deviation main clinical signs. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on Medline, Scopus and Cochrane following a protocol designed a priori, to define sensitivity of \"snap\" sound absence, slow detumescence and penile deviation. Based on the literature search of 93 articles, 15 were included (73 patients). All patients referred pain, most of them during coitus (n = 57; 78%). Detumescence occurred in 37/73 (51%), and all patients described detumescence occurrence as \"slow\". The results show that single anamnestic item have a high-moderate sensibility in the diagnosis of FPF, and the highest sensitive item was penile deviation (sensibility = 0.86). However, when more than one item is present, overall sensitivity increases greatly, closing to 100% (95% Confidence Interval 92-100). Surgeons can consciously decide between additional exams, a conservative approach, and rapid intervention using these indicators to detect FPF. Our findings identified symptoms with excellent specificity for FPF diagnosis, giving clinicians more useful tools for making decisions."

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems, significantly impacting the cardiovascular system. One potential complication of acute SLE flare is the development of pericardial effusion which can lead to potentially life-threatening consequences if not promptly identified. In this report, we describe the case of a 35-year-old female with a known history of SLE who developed rapid-onset, large-volume pericardial effusion with tamponade during a lupus flare. She received emergency treatment involving pericardiocentesis and was administered high doses of glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive medication. As a result, the pericardial effusion gradually resolved, and the patient's symptoms improved. This case emphasizes the significance of immediately identifying and managing swiftly progressing pericardial effusion in SLE patients. This is crucial as it can lead to severe and potentially lethal complications."

    "abstract": "Triage is the process of identifying patients with both the greatest clinical need and the greatest likelihood of benefit in the setting of limited clinical resources. The primary objective of this study was to assess the ability of formal mass casualty incident triage tools to identify patients requiring urgent lifesaving interventions. Data from the Alberta Trauma Registry (ATR) was used to assess seven triage tools: START, JumpSTART, SALT, RAMP, MPTT, BCD and MITT. Clinical data captured in the ATR was used to determine which triage category each of the seven tools would have applied to each patient. These categorizations were compared to a reference standard definition based on the patients' need for specific urgent lifesaving interventions. Of the 9448 records that were captured 8652 were included in our analysis. The most sensitive triage tool was MPTT, which demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.76 (0.75, 0.78). Four of the seven triage tools evaluated had sensitivities below 0.45. JumpSTART had the lowest sensitivity and the highest under-triage rate for pediatric patients. All the triage tools evaluated had a moderate to high positive predictive value (> 0.67) for patients who had experienced penetrating trauma. There was a wide range in the sensitivity of triage tools to identify patients requiring urgent lifesaving interventions. MPTT, BCD and MITT were the most sensitive triage tools assessed. All of the triage tools assessed should be employed with caution during mass casualty incidents as they may fail to identify a large proportion of patients requiring urgent lifesaving interventions. OBJECTIFS: Le triage est le processus qui consiste à identifier les patients qui ont à la fois les besoins cliniques les plus importants et les avantages les plus probables dans le contexte de ressources cliniques limitées. Le principal objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer la capacité des outils formels de triage des incidents impliquant des blessés de masse à identifier les patients nécessitant des interventions urgentes de sauvetage. MéTHODES: Les données du Alberta Trauma Registry (ATR) ont été utilisées pour évaluer sept outils de triage : START, JumpSTART, SALT, RAMP, MPTT, BCD et MITT. Les données cliniques saisies dans l’AR ont servi à déterminer la catégorie de triage que chacun des sept outils aurait appliquée à chaque patient. Ces catégories ont été comparées à une définition standard de référence fondée sur le besoin des patients d’interventions de sauvetage urgentes. RéSULTATS: Sur les 9448 enregistrements saisis, 8652 ont été inclus dans notre analyse. L’outil de triage le plus sensible était le TPMD, qui présentait une sensibilité de 0,76 (0,75, 0,78). Quatre des sept outils de triage évalués présentaient une sensibilité inférieure à 0,45. JumpSTART avait la sensibilité la plus faible et le taux de sous-triage le plus élevé chez les patients pédiatriques. Tous les outils de triage évalués avaient une valeur prédictive positive modérée à élevée (>0,67) pour les patients qui avaient subi un traumatisme pénétrant. La sensibilité des outils de triage pour identifier les patients nécessitant des interventions de sauvetage urgentes variait grandement. Les outils de triage les plus sensibles ont été le TCPR, le BCD et le MITT. Tous les outils de triage évalués doivent être utilisés avec prudence lors d’incidents impliquant des pertes massives, car ils peuvent ne pas identifier une grande proportion de patients nécessitant des interventions de sauvetage urgentes."

    "abstract": "Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC) is characterized by reversible left ventricular apical ballooning in the absence of angiographically significant coronary artery disease. While TTC is usually preceded by an emotionally stressful event, physical trauma has been documented as a precipitating incident as well. An 82-year-old female with no past medical history, presented to the emergency department following a motor vehicle collision. Trauma workup was significant for an ulnar fracture, elevated cardiac enzymes, and ST-segment changes. Bedside echocardiogram revealed apical ballooning. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which failed to demonstrate significant coronary artery disease. The patient developed cardiogenic shock and required temporary vasopressor support after failing a trial of intra-aortic balloon pump. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is a rare complication of trauma, which presents with signs and symptoms similar to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but without evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. Following trauma, signs of ACS in elderly women should raise provider's suspicion for TTC and prompting bedside echocardiography, which can assist with early diagnosis."

    "abstract": "A considerable number of patients with mild traumatic brain injury have been known to \"talk and die.\" Serial neurological examinations, however, have been the only method of determining the necessity of repeat computed tomography (CT), and no validated method has been available to predict early deterioration of minor head injury. This study aimed to evaluate the association between hypertension and bradycardia, a classic sign of raised intracranial pressure (Cushing reflex) on hospital arrival and determine the clinical consequences of minor head injury after blunt trauma. We created a new Cushing Index (CI) by dividing the systolic blood pressure by the heart rate (equaling the inverse number of the Shock Index, a score for hemodynamic stability) and hypothesized that a high CI would predict surgical intervention for deterioration and in-hospital death among patients with minor head injury. To test our hypothesis, a retrospective observational study was conducted using a nationwide trauma database. Accordingly, adult blunt trauma with minor head injury (defined as a Glasgow Coma Scale of 13-15 and Abbreviated Injury Scale score of ≥2 in the head) who were transported directly from the scene by ambulances were included. Among the 338,744 trauma patients identified in the database, 38,844 were eligible for inclusion. A restricted cubic spline regression curve for risks of in-hospital death was created using the CI. Thereafter, the thresholds were determined based on inflection points of the curve, and patients were divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-CI groups. Patients with high CI showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates compared with those with intermediate CI (351 [3.0%] vs. 373 [2.3%]; odds ratio [OR] = 1.32 [1.14-1.53]; p < 0.001). Patients with high index also had a higher incidence of emergency cranial surgery within 24h after arrival than those with an intermediate CI (746 [6.4%] vs. 879 [5.4%]; OR = 1.20 [1.08-1.33]; p < 0.001). In addition, patients with low CI (equal to high Shock Index, meaning hemodynamically unstable) showed higher in-hospital death compared with those with intermediate CI (360 [3.3%] vs. 373 [2.3%]; p < 0.001). In conclusion, a high CI (high systolic blood pressure and low heart rate) on hospital arrival would be helpful in identifying patients with minor head injury who might experience deterioration and need close observation."

    "abstract": "We present the case of a man in his 30s who was crushed between two vehicles sustaining blunt trauma to his lower limbs and torso. The patient was in shock on arrival to the emergency department, and immediate resuscitation was given with massive transfusion protocol activation. Once the patient's haemodynamic status was stabilised, a CT scan revealed a complete colon transection. The patient was taken to the operating theatre where a midline laparotomy was performed, and the transected descending colon was managed with a segmental resection and handsewn anastomosis. The patient followed an unremarkable postoperative course, with bowels opening on day 8 postoperatively. Colon injuries are rare following blunt abdominal trauma, and a delay in diagnosis may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. As such, a low threshold for surgical intervention is recommended."

    "abstract": "Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) is integrated into modern emergency medical services because of its suggested mortality benefit in certain patient populations, it is an expensive resource and appropriate use/feasibility in low- to middle income countries (LMIC) is highly debated. To maximise benefit, correct patient selection in HEMS is paramount. To achieve this, current practices first need to be described. The study aims to describe a population of patients utilising HEMS in South Africa, in terms of flight data, patient demographics, provisional diagnosis, as well as clinical characteristics and interventions. A retrospective flight- and patient-chart review were conducted, extracting clinical and mission data of a single aeromedical operator in South Africa, over a 12-month period (July 2017 - June 2018) in Gauteng, Free State, Mpumalanga and North-West provinces. A total of 916 cases were included (203 primary cases, 713 interfacility transport (IFT) cases). Most patients transported were male (n=548, 59.8%) and suffered blunt trauma (n=379, 41.4%). Medical pathology (n=247, 27%) and neonatal transfers (n=184, 20.1%) follows. Flights occurred mainly in daylight hours (n=729, 79.6%) with median mission times of 1-hour 53 minutes (primary missions), and 3 hours 10 minutes (IFT missions). Median on-scene times were 26 minutes (primary missions) and 55 minutes (IFT missions). Almost half were transported with an endotracheal tube (n=428, 46.7%), with a large number receiving no respiratory support (n=414, 45.2%). No patients received fibrinolysis, defibrillation, cardioversion or cardiac pacing. Intravenous fluid therapy (n=867, 94.7%) was almost universal, with common administration of sedation (n=430, 46.9%) and analgesia (n=329, 35.9%). Apart from the lack of universal call-out criteria and response to the high burden of trauma, HEMS seem to fulfil an important critical care transport role. It seems that cardiac pathologies are under-represented in this study and might have an important implication for crew training requirements."

Rarer still are cases of celiac artery avulsion in the setting of blunt trauma. There is little literature describing such injury patterns. The farthest-reaching is a case series by Kronich et al. 2017, which compiles eleven cases. The majority of these injuries were incomplete intimal injuries only appreciated on admission imaging. A further literature review reveals five cases of full avulsions in the setting of blunt trauma. Management varied dramatically among these cases. The multidisciplinary nature of vascular trauma, in combination with new vascular repair techniques provides a paradox of choice regarding acute management in unusual presentations. With intuitional review board approval, we report a case of blunt trauma with complete celiac trunk avulsion in a patient with aberrant visceral vascular anatomy, managed with open exploration and ligation."

    "abstract": "Temporal bone injuries due to gunshot wounds are uncommon but devastating, with a high risk of damage to critical neurovascular structures. The high resistance of the temporal bone, the densest bone in the human body, can sometimes avoid a fatal outcome. However, the complications are in many cases devastating and include hearing loss, facial paralysis, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, intracranial damage, and vascular injuries. Our goal was to report a case of ballistic injury to the temporal bone and describe the surgical approach taken for treatment. A 74-year-old man was transferred to the emergency room of our tertiary hospital, intubated and sedated, after an attempted suicide with a firearm. The CT scan showed the metal projectile lodged within the temporal bone on the right side, with the destruction of the ossicular chain and bony labyrinth. After stabilization, sedation was reversed, and the otolaryngology team was called. On examination, the entry wound was located in the cavum concha, with no active bleeding but presenting active otorrhea of cerebrospinal fluid. The patient had complete peripheral facial paralysis on the right side and spontaneous horizontal nystagmus toward the left side. Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated. A subtotal petrosectomy was performed, with the removal of the foreign body, repair of the cerebrospinal fluid fistula, obliteration of the cavity with abdominal fat, and closure of the external auditory canal. He was discharged on the 11th-day post-surgery, maintaining complete facial paralysis and right-side anacusis, but was able to walk with assistance. In conclusion, penetrating trauma of the temporal bone is a potentially life-threatening situation, and patients that survive have a guarded prognosis, as it often leads to permanent sequelae even when managed promptly."

In recent years, indications for RT have been extended from penetrating to blunt trauma. However, discussions on efficacy are still ongoing, as data on this rarely performed procedure are often scarce. Therefore, this study analyzed RT approaches, intraoperative findings, and clinical outcome measures following RT in patients with cardiac arrest following blunt trauma. All patients admitted to our level I trauma center's emergency room (ER) who underwent RT between 2010 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Retrospective chart reviews were performed for clinical data, laboratory values, injuries observed during RT, and surgical procedures. Additionally, autopsy protocols were assessed to describe injury patterns accurately. Fifteen patients were included in this study with a median ISS of 57 (IQR 41-75). The 24-h survival rate was 20%, and the total survival rate was 7%. Three approaches were used to expose the thorax: Anterolateral thoracotomy, clamshell thoracotomy, and sternotomy. A wide variety of injuries were detected, which required complex surgical interventions. These included aortic cross-clamping, myocardial suture repairs, and pulmonary lobe resections. Blunt trauma often results in severe injuries in various body regions. Therefore, potential injuries and corresponding surgical interventions must be known when performing RT. However, the chances of survival following RT in traumatic cardiac arrest cases following blunt trauma are small."

It is a rare disease, with only one such case reported in the literature. In this case report, we assessed a patient rectal cancer in addition to hemopneumopericardium, dyspnea, and chest pain. A 47-year-old Arab woman previously diagnosed with rectal cancer metastasized to bones, lymph nodes, and lungs post-Hartmann procedure reported to the emergency department complaining of worsening dyspnea for 2 weeks, more significantly in the supine position. A productive cough with yellowish sputum characterized this; however, there was no pertinent family or psychological history. Examination of the respiratory system revealed dullness on the left side associated with decreased breath sound. The chest radiograph also revealed marked hydro-pneumopericardium. Spiral computed tomography angiography of pulmonary arteries demonstrated pericardial effusion with the air fluid level at pericardial space, implying hydro-pneumopericardium. A successful pericardiocentesis was performed, in which 180 cc of blood-filled pericardial fluid was drained, suggesting the presence of hemopneumopericardium. Hemopneumopericardium has multiple etiologies, yet critical intervention is restricted in patients with cardiac tamponade. Hence, pericardiocentesis could be a definitive treatment."

    "abstract": "The popliteal artery damage is present to range from 1.6% to 64% of patients with knee dislocation, and it is crucial to evaluate vascular damage even if there are no prominent ischemic changes in the distal area. The injury of the popliteal artery by high-energy forces around the knee caused by a fall or traffic accident is a potentially limb-threatening complication in traumatic knee dislocation. The popliteal artery injury by blunt trauma has a high risk of limb amputation because the initial symptoms can show normal vascular circulation without urgent ischemia or obvious vascular injury signs. Since the collateral branches can delay the symptoms of decisive ischemia or pulseless extremity, the vascular damage is a major cause of limb amputation. In the present study, we describe a rare case of delayed diagnosis of popliteal artery injury after traumatic knee dislocation, requiring urgent limb revascularization surgery. After revascularization of the occluded popliteal artery, graft interposition was performed, and successful restoration was confirmed. This case illustrates that, even if ankle-brachial index >0.9 or equal pedal pulse to the uninjured extremity, serial vascular evaluation is required if there are soft signs such as diminished pulses, neurologic signs, or high-energy damage such as multiple ligament ruptures since delayed diagnosis of artery injury can be the major cause of limb amputation. The clinicians need to regard high-energy trauma such as multiple ligament rupture around the knee as a hard sign, and immediate computed tomography angiography can be helpful for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

Patients are deemed to be severely undertriaged (SU), placing them at risk for adverse outcomes, when they do not meet TTA criteria but nonetheless sustain significant injuries (Injury Severity Score [ISS] ≥25). Delineate patient demographics, injuries, and outcomes after SU. Trauma patients presenting to our ACS-verified Level 1 trauma center with ISS ≥25 were included (11/2015-03/2022). Transfers and private vehicle transports were excluded. Patients were dichotomized and compared by trauma arrival level: TTA (Appropriately Triaged, AT) vs routine consults (SU). Study criteria were satisfied by 1653 patients: 1375 (83%) AT and 278 (17%) SU. Severely undertriaged patients were older than AT patients (47 vs 36 years, P < .001). Severely undertriaged occurred almost exclusively following blunt trauma (96% vs 71%, P < .001). Injury Severity Score was lower following SU than AT (29 vs 32, P < .001). The most common severe injuries (Abbreviated Injury Scale score [AIS] ≥3) among the SU group were in the Chest (n = 179, 64%). Severely undertriaged patients necessitated emergent intubation (n = 34, 12%), surgery (n = 59, 21%), and angioembolization (n = 22, 8%) at high rates. Severely undertriaged mortality was n = 40, 14%. Severely undertriaged occurred among a substantial proportion of ISS ≥25 patients, predominately following blunt trauma. Severe chest injuries were most likely to evade capture. Rates of intubation, emergent intervention, and in-hospital mortality were high after SU. Efforts should be made to identify such patients in the field as they may benefit from TTA."

Patients with subacute perforations can present with a variety of symptoms, whereas those with acute perforations usually present with cardiac tamponade that necessitates emergent pericardiocentesis. A 32-year-old woman underwent pacemaker implantation for sick sinus syndrome. An active-fixation atrial lead was fixed to the right atrial appendage, and a ventricular lead was fixed to the right ventricle (RV) apex, with acceptable parameters. Two weeks postoperative, the patient visited the clinic for routine examination of the pacemaker parameters. Chest X-ray showed migration of the RV lead beyond the cardiac silhouette. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of pericardial effusion or tamponade. Computed tomography revealed that the RV lead was positioned beyond the RV and pericardium and into the anterior chest wall. Procedural lead revision was performed with cardiothoracic surgery backup. The lead was retracted after loosening the active-fixation screw and inserting the stylet. The lead was placed in the RV septum with active fixation. The procedure was completed without complications, and the patient was discharged after 3 days. Subacute lead perforations can present with various symptoms, and some patients may be asymptomatic without pericardial effusion. Altered lead parameters frequently provide the first indication for the diagnosis of cardiac perforation. Transvenous lead revision with surgical backup is an alternative to surgical extraction."

    "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular mortality, and it is caused by a diverse array of conditions. Among these is commotio cordis, a relatively infrequent but still significant cause, often seen in young athletes involved in competitive or recreational sports. It is known to be caused by blunt trauma to the chest wall resulting in life-threatening arrhythmia (typically ventricular fibrillation). The current understanding pertains to blunt trauma to the precordium, with an outcome depending on factors such as the type of stimulus, the force of impact, the qualities of the projectile (shape, size, and density), the site of impact, and the timing of impact in relation to the cardiac cycle. In the management of commotio cordis, a history of preceding blunt chest trauma is usually encountered. Imaging is mostly unremarkable except for ECG, which may show malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment is focused on emergent resuscitation with the advanced cardiac life support protocol algorithm, with extensive workup following the return of spontaneous circulation. In the absence of underlying cardiovascular pathologies, implantable cardiac defibrillator insertion is not beneficial, and patients can even resume physical activity if the workup is unremarkable. Proper follow-up is also key in the management and monitoring of re-entrant ventricular arrhythmias, which are amenable to ablative therapy. Prevention of this condition involves protecting the chest wall against blunt trauma, especially with the use of safety balls and chest protectors in certain high-risk sporting activities.  This study aims to elucidate the current epidemiology and clinical management of SCD with a particular focus on a rarely explored etiology, commotio cordis."

We will present an intriguing case of a 59-year-old Caucasian female who arrived at the emergency department with diffused chest and abdominal pain that began in her left shoulder and went down to the right lower quadrant area. The patient was in visible pain with restlessness, and her abdomen was moderately distended. The computed tomography (CT) showed possible perforation in the gastric bypass surgery area, but the results were inconclusive. The patient had laparoscopic cholecystectomy ten days prior, and the pain began right after surgery. The patient underwent an open abdominal exploratory surgery, with the closure of the perforated marginal ulcer. The fact that the patient had undergone another surgery and had pain immediately afterward also obscured the diagnosis. This case shows the rare presentation of the patientäs diverse signs and symptoms and inconclusive reports that led to the open abdominal exploratory surgery that finally confirmed the diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of a thorough past medical history, including surgical history.

During the emergent exploratory laparotomy, she responded well to the blood transfusion; the stable retroperitoneal hematoma indicated no need to explore it. A subsequent episode of hemodynamic instability necessitated another laparotomy, during which the hematoma was evacuated and both ovarian arteries were ligated. Shortly thereafter, the patient suffered a pulmonary embolism (PE). In multiparous patients presenting with peripartum retroperitoneal hematoma and hemorrhagic shock, exploring the hematoma and ligating the ovarian and uterine arteries may reduce the risk of PE or the need for reoperation."

To evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests for detecting blunt cardiac injury (BCI) and its complications, in patients with severe chest injuries, who are assessed in an emergency department or by any front-line emergency physician. A targeted search strategy was performed using Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases from 1993 up to October 2022. Data on at least one of the following diagnostic tests: electrocardiogram (ECG), serum creatinine phosphokinase-MB level (CPK-MB), echocardiography (Echo), Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or Cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Diagnostic tests for cardiac contusion were evaluated for their accuracy in meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 and the QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess bias of the studies. This systematic review yielded 51 studies (n = 5,359). The weighted mean incidence of myocardial injuries after sustaining a blunt force trauma stood at 18.3% of cases. Overall weighted mean mortality among patients with blunt cardiac injury was 7.6% (1.4-36.4%). Initial ECG, cTnI, cTnT and transthoracic echocardiography TTE all showed high specificity (> 80%), but lower sensitivity (< 70%). TEE had a specificity of 72.1% (range 35.8-98.2%) and sensitivity of 86.7% (range 40-99.2%) in diagnosing cardiac contusion. CK-MB had the lowest diagnostic odds ratio of 3.598 (95% CI: 1.832-7.068). Normal ECG accompanied by normal cTnI showed a high sensitivity of 85% in ruling out cardiac injuries. Emergency physicians face great challenges in diagnosing cardiac injuries in patients following blunt trauma. In the majority of cases, joint use of ECG and cTnI was a pragmatic and cost-effective approach to rule out cardiac injuries. In addition, TEE may be highly accurate in identifying cardiac injuries in suspected cases."

    "abstract": "The Brazilian medical emergency services presented a significant development due to the investment in emergency care units, increasing the expansion of the services. However, there was a surge in need for secondary patient transfers, which served as the common link in a wide web of tertiary hospital access. This study aimed to assess the outcome of trauma patients who required secondary transfer. This prospective observational cross-sectional study included 2302 patients (565 from the study group and 1737 from the control group) and compared the outcome of patients hospitalized for trauma referred by secondary transfer or those who directly visited the Emergency Unit of the municipality with a Brazilian medical emergency system. As for the trauma mechanism, there was a predominance of blunt trauma (93.32 %), 34.5 % were elderly, 12.45 % suffered severe traumatic brain injury, and 18.44 % had severe trauma rate (injury severity score > 15). The outcome of death did not present a significant difference between the groups, even when evaluated considering possible risk factors, such as the elderly age (over 65 years of age) and trauma index. There was no significant difference in terms of the outcome of death in patients who underwent secondary transfer and those with direct access to medical emergency services. However, patients who underwent secondary transfer had an increase in the length of hospital stay."

    "title": "Gastric Necrosis Due to Small Bowel Obstruction: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "Gastric necrosis is a rare entity due to the normal anatomy of the stomach; the irrigation of the stomach is abundant and has vast collateral irrigation that prevents necrosis from happening in normal situations. Gastric ischemia doesn't happen even if arterial occlusion occurs; however, a venous occlusion caused by an increase in intragastric pressure (measured ﻿>20 cm H2O in some experiments) that surpasses gastric venous pressure can precipitate necrosis of the stomach. Here we present the case of a 79-year-old woman with a history of chronic smoking, Alzheimer's dementia, systemic hypertension, hypothyroidism, chronic constipation, and a hysterectomy performed 25 years ago. An exploratory laparotomy was performed with the following findings: 3 liters of fecaloid fluid in the abdominal cavity, 70% necrosis of the stomach affecting major curvature and 80% of the fundus without compromising the cardia, a perforation in the anterior portion of the stomach with a diameter of 6 cm, a right femoral hernia with small bowel entrapment, intestinal obstruction with dilated small bowel; and intestinal necrosis of 7 cm of the ileum that was inside the femoral hernia. A vertical gastrectomy for the necrotic stomach and intestinal resection with termino-terminal anastomosis in the affected segment of the ileum were performed. The patient had a poor response to treatment and finally died 72 hours after surgery due to abdominal sepsis. This report shows that gastric necrosis, although rare, can be a cause of acute abdominal pain. It highlights the importance of a good clinical examination and imaging studies in detecting the causes of small bowel obstruction and offering prompt diagnosis and treatment to patients with small bowel obstruction."

    "abstract": "There are less than 20 reported cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumors in pregnancy. Of these reported cases, there are only two that detail GIST in the first trimester. We report our experience with the third known GIST diagnosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. Notably, our case report highlights the earliest known gestational age at time of GIST diagnosis. We conducted a literature review of GIST diagnosis in pregnancy via PUBMED, using a combination of the following terms: (pregnancy or gestation) and (GIST). We utilized Epic for chart review of our patient's case report. A 24 year old G3P1011 presented to the Emergency Department at 4w6d by last menstrual period (LMP) with worsening abdominal cramping, bloating, and associated nausea. Physical exam revealed a large, mobile, nontender mass palpated in the right lower abdomen. Transvagianl ultrasound noted the presence of a large pelvic mass of unknown etiology. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained for further characterization, revealing a 7.3× 12.4 × 12.2 cm mass with multiple fluid levels, centered in the anterior mesentery. Exploratory laparotomy was performed with en bloc resection of small bowel and pelvic mass, with pathology demonstrating a 12.8 cm spindle cell neoplasm compatible with GIST and notable for a mitotic rate of 40 mitoses/50 high power field (HPF). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was pursued in order to predict tumor responsiveness to Imatinib, which revealed a mutation at KIT exon 11, suggesting a response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. The patient's multidisciplinary treatment team, consisting of medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, and maternal fetal medicine specialists, made the recommendation for adjuvant Imatinib therapy. The patient was offered termination of pregnancy with immediate initiation of Imatinib, as well as continuation of pregnancy with either immediate or delayed treatment. Interdisciplinary counseling focused on both the maternal and fetal implications of each proposed management plan. She ultimately elected termination of pregnancy, and underwent an uncomplicated dilation and evacuation. GIST diagnosis in pregnancy is exceedingly rare. Patients with high-grade disease encounter a multitude of decision-making dilemmas, often with competing maternal and fetal interests. As additional cases of GIST in pregnancy are added to the literature, clinicians will be able to implement evidence-based options counseling for their patients. Shared decision-making is contingent upon patient understanding of diagnosis, risk of recurrence, available treatment options, and the treatment-related implications on maternal and fetal outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for optimization of patient-centered care."

Our study aims to investigate the impact of preinjury APT/OAC use on outcomes of moderate to severe blunt trauma. This is a retrospective cohort study from Jan 2017 - Dec 2019 of all patients with moderate to severe blunt trauma. A 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed to address for confounding factors. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Our secondary outcomes were severity of head injury and need for emergency surgery within the first 24 hours. There were 592 patients (APT/OAC n=72, no APT/OAC n=520) included in our study. The median age was 74 years in APT/OAC and 58 years in no APT/OAC. PSM resulted in 150 patients (APT/OAC n=50, no APT/OAC n=100). In the PSM cohort, more patients with APT/OAC use had ischemic heart disease (76% vs 0%, P<0.001). APT/OAC use was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (22.0% vs 9.0%, Odds ratio (OR) 3.00, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.05, 8.56, P=0.040) Severity of head injury (abbreviated injury scale in APT/OAC: 3.33 ± 1.53, vs 2.97 ± 1.43, P=0.380) and need for emergency surgery (APT/OAC 16.2% vs 11.0%, P=0.434) was comparable between APT/OAC and no APT/OAC. Preinjury APT/OAC use was associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Severity of head injury and need for emergency surgery within 24 hours from admission were comparable between APT/OAC use and no APT/OAC use."

    "title": "Association of Prehospital Transfusion With Mortality in Pediatric Trauma.",
    "abstract": "Optimal hemostatic resuscitation in pediatric trauma is not well defined. To assess the association of prehospital blood transfusion (PHT) with outcomes in injured children. This retrospective cohort study of the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation database included children aged 0 to 17 years old who received a PHT or emergency department blood transfusion (EDT) from January 2009 and December 2019. Interfacility transfers and isolated burn mechanism were excluded. Analysis took place between November 2022 and January 2023. Receipt of a blood product transfusion in the prehospital setting compared with the emergency department. The primary outcome was 24-hour mortality. A 3:1 propensity score match was developed balancing for age, injury mechanism, shock index, and prehospital Glasgow Comma Scale score. A mixed-effects logistic regression was performed in the matched cohort further accounting for patient sex, Injury Severity Score, insurance status, and potential center-level heterogeneity. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and complications. Of 559 children included, 70 (13%) received prehospital transfusions. In the unmatched cohort, the PHT and EDT groups had comparable age (median [IQR], 47 [9-16] vs 14 [9-17] years), sex (46 [66%] vs 337 [69%] were male), and insurance status (42 [60%] vs 245 [50%]). The PHT group had higher rates of shock (39 [55%] vs 204 [42%]) and blunt trauma mechanism (57 [81%] vs 277 [57%]) and lower median (IQR) Injury Severity Score (14 [5-29] vs 25 [16-36]). Propensity matching resulted in a weighted cohort of 207 children, including 68 of 70 recipients of PHT, and produced well-balanced groups. Both 24-hour (11 [16%] vs 38 [27%]) and in-hospital mortality (14 [21%] vs 44 [32%]) were lower in the PHT cohort compared with the EDT cohort, respectively; there was no difference in in-hospital complications. Mixed-effects logistic regression in the postmatched group adjusting for the confounders listed above found PHT was associated with a significant reduction in 24-hour (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23-0.91) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27-0.97) compared with EDT. The number needed to transfuse in the prehospital setting to save 1 child's life was 5 (95% CI, 3-10). In this study, prehospital transfusion was associated with lower rates of mortality compared with transfusion on arrival to the emergency department, suggesting bleeding pediatric patients may benefit from early hemostatic resuscitation. Further prospective studies are warranted. Although the logistics of prehospital blood product programs are complex, strategies to shift hemostatic resuscitation toward the immediate postinjury period should be pursued."

Etomidate, ketamine, and propofol are safe in the trauma population-at-large but have not been assessed in patients with ongoing hemorrhage. We hypothesize that in hemorrhaging patients with penetrating injury, propofol deleteriously affects peri-induction hypotension compared to etomidate and ketamine. Retrospective cohort study. Primary outcome was the effect of induction agent on peri-induction systolic blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of peri-induction vasopressor use and quantity of peri-induction blood transfusion requirements. Linear multivariate regression modeling assessed the effect of induction agent on the variables of interest. 169 patients were included, 146 received propofol and 23 received etomidate or ketamine. Univariate analysis revealed no difference in peri-induction systolic blood pressure (P = .53), peri-induction vasopressor administration (P = .62), or transfusion requirements within the first hour after induction (PRBC P = .24, FFP P = .19, PLT P = .29). Choice of RSI agent did not independently predict peri-induction systolic blood pressure or blood product administration. Rather, only presenting shock index independently predicted peri-induction hypotension. This is the first study to directly assess the peri-induction effects of anesthetic induction agent choice in penetrating trauma patients undergoing emergent hemorrhage control surgery. Propofol does not appear to worsen peri-induction hypotension regardless of dose. Patient physiology is most predictive of peri-induction hypotension."

    "abstract": "Understanding the variation in training and nuances of trauma provider practice between the countries in Europe and the United States is a daunting task. This article briefly reviews the key specialties of trauma care in Europe including emergency medical services (EMS), emergency medicine, anesthesia, trauma surgery, and critical care. The authors hope to inform U.S. military clinicians and medical planners of the major differences in emergency and trauma care that exist across Europe. Emergency medicine exists as both a primary specialty and a subspecialty across Europe, with varying stages of development as a specialty in each country. There is heavy physician involvement in EMS in much of Europe, with anesthesiologists having additional EMS training typically providing prehospital critical care. Because of the historical predominance of blunt trauma in Europe, in many countries, trauma surgery is a subspecialty with initial orthopedic surgery training versus general surgery. Intensive care medicine has various training pathways across Europe, but there have been great advances in standardizing competency requirements across the European Union. Finally, the authors suggest some strategies to mitigate the potential negative consequences of joint medical teams and how to leverage some key differences to advance life-saving medical interoperability across the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance."

It is associated with high fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. In this case, we describe a 25-year-old primigravida female who presented as a trauma activation with acute hypotension following blunt trauma to the abdomen and who was found to have a viable abdominal pregnancy with placental abruption. Given hypotension and non-reassuring fetal heart tones, the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for emergent exploratory laparotomy and cesarean section. The placenta was severely adhered to a portion of small bowel, the appendix, and the right adnexa with an approximate 20% abruption. The placenta and adhered structures were removed. In pregnant patients presenting after blunt trauma with free intraabdominal fluid and hypotension, abdominal pregnancy with abruption should be considered as an unlikely differential."

    "abstract": "Oncologic emergencies are a wide spectrum of oncologic conditions caused directly by malignancies or their treatment. Oncologic emergencies may be classified according to the underlying physiopathology in metabolic, hematologic, and structural conditions. In the latter, radiologists have a pivotal role, through an accurate diagnosis useful to provide optimal patient care. Structural conditions may involve the central nervous system, thorax, or abdomen, and emergency radiologists have to know the characteristics imaging findings of each one of them. The number of oncologic emergencies is growing due to the increased incidence of malignancies in the general population and also to the improved survival of these patients thanks to the advances in cancer treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) could be a solution to assist emergency radiologists with this rapidly increasing workload. To our knowledge, AI applications in the setting of the oncologic emergency are mostly underexplored, probably due to the relatively low number of oncologic emergencies and the difficulty in training algorithms. However, cancer emergencies are defined by the cause and not by a specific pattern of radiological symptoms and signs. Therefore, it can be expected that AI algorithms developed for the detection of these emergencies in the non-oncological field can be transferred to the clinical setting of oncologic emergency. In this review, a craniocaudal approach was followed and central nervous system, thoracic, and abdominal oncologic emergencies have been addressed regarding the AI applications reported in literature. Among the central nervous system emergencies, AI applications have been reported for brain herniation and spinal cord compression. In the thoracic district the addressed emergencies were pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade and pneumothorax. Pneumothorax was the most frequently described application for AI, to improve sensibility and to reduce the time-to-diagnosis. Finally, regarding abdominal emergencies, AI applications for abdominal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, and intestinal intussusception have been described."

A 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark, tarry stools. Prior to his current presentation, the patient sought medical care from several primary care centers for vague abdominal pain that was diagnosed as dyspepsia, and he was prescribed omeprazole. During the current presentation, the patient had hemodynamic instability and a diffusely tender abdomen. Subsequently, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm with AEF. Although the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, he suffered cardiac arrest and ultimately died in the operating room. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and management of AEF, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes."

Differentiating coronary vasospasm from an acute atherothrombotic event is diagnostically challenging and requires a careful clinical history combined with electrocardiographic and angiographic abnormalities to make the diagnosis and guide therapy. We report a case of cardiogenic shock secondary to cardiac tamponade leading to an endogenous catecholamine surge resulting in profound arterial vasospasm and STEMI. The patient presented with chest pain and inferior ST segment elevations prompting emergent coronary angiography, demonstrating subtotal occlusion of the right coronary artery, severe proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, and diffusely stenosed aortoiliac vessels. Emergent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion and hemodynamics consistent with cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis resulted in dramatic hemodynamic improvement with immediate normalization of ST segments. Repeat coronary angiography performed one day later showed no angiographically significant coronary or peripheral arterial stenosis. This is the first reported case of simultaneous coronary and peripheral arterial vasospasm presenting as inferior STEMI caused by endogenous catecholamines from cardiac tamponade. Several clues suggest coronary vasospasm including the discordant electrocardiography (ECG) and coronary angiographic findings as well as diffusely stenosed aortoiliac vessels. Diffuse vasospasm was confirmed when repeat angiography performed after pericardiocentesis demonstrated angiographic resolution of coronary and peripheral arterial stenosis. Though rare, circulating endogenous catecholamines resulting in diffuse coronary vasospasm may present as STEMI and should be considered based on the clinical history, ECG findings, and coronary angiography."

Following ethics approval, a retrospective chart review of 447 consecutive patients undergoing emergency CTA at two large teaching hospitals was conducted to determine the presence of risk factors for each Denver criterion set. Imaging studies of adults conducted between January 2016 and June 2020 containing sufficient clinical information for accurate classification were included in the study. Specificity, sensitivity, and predictive values were calculated. A two-sided Fisher exact test was used to evaluate the association between each iteration of the Denver criteria and the presence of BCVI. The specificities of the Original, Modified, and Expanded Denver criteria were 43.58%, 34.32%, and 24.85%, respectively. Positive-predictive values (PPV) followed a different trend, with respective values of 2.77%, 3.06%, and 2.78%. Sensitivity and negative-predictive values (NPV) were found to be 100% for each criterion set. Being positive for a criterion set, and the presence of BCVI, was statistically significant for the original Denver criteria (p = 0.021, n = 443), but not the modified (p = 0.100, n = 345) or expanded Denver criteria (p = 0.202, n = 333). Use of the modified and expanded Denver criteria leads to the overuse of cerebrovascular imaging on patients suffering blunt force trauma. The original Denver criteria may more appropriately identify subjects for further evaluation with CTA than the current standard, while retaining diagnostic efficacy for BCVI."

The 2017-2019 TQIP was used to 1:2 match methamphetamine (meth+) patients to patients testing negative for all drugs (meth-). Patients with polysubstance/alcohol use were excluded. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed. The rate of methamphetamine use was 3.1 %. After matching, there was no difference in vitals, injury severity score, sex, and comorbidities between cohorts (all p > 0.05). Compared to meth-, the meth+ group was more commonly sustained penetrating trauma (19.8 % vs. 9.2 %, p < 0.001) with stab-wounds being the most common penetrating mechanism (10.5 % vs. 4.5 %, p < 0.001). The meth+ group more commonly underwent surgery immediately from the emergency department (ED) (20.3 % vs. 13.3 %, p < 0.001). The associated risk of death in the ED was higher for the meth+ group (OR 2.77, CI 1.45-5.28, p = 0.002), however, the risk was similar for patients that were admitted or received an operation (p = 0.065). Trauma patients using methamphetamine more commonly presented after gun or knife violence and required immediate surgical intervention. They also have increased associated risk of death in the ED. Given these serious findings, a multidisciplinary approach in helping curtail the worsening epidemic of methamphetamine use appears warranted as it is related to penetrating trauma and outcomes. IV."

There is a paucity of trauma data in this region and this study aimed to show the pattern of presentation and outcome of patients with abdominal trauma at a North-Central Nigerian Teaching Hospital. This was a retrospective, observational study of patients with abdominal trauma who presented at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital from January 2013 to December 2019. Patients with clinical and/or radiological evidence of abdominal trauma were identified, and data extracted and analyzed. A total of 87 patients were included in the study. There were 73 males and 14 females (5.2:1) with a mean age of 34.2 years. Blunt abdominal injury occurred in 53 (61%) patients with 10 patients (11%) having concomitant extra-abdominal injuries. A total of 105 abdominal organ injuries occurred in 87 patients with the small bowel being the most frequently injured organ in penetrating trauma, while in blunt abdominal injury, the spleen was most commonly injured. A total of 70 patients (80.5%) had emergency abdominal surgery with a morbidity rate of 38.6% and negative laparotomy rate of 2.9%. There were 15 deaths in the period accounting for 17% of patients with sepsis as the most common cause of death (66%). Shock at presentation, late presentation >12 h, need for perioperative intensive care unit admission, and repeat surgery were associated with a higher risk of mortality (P < 0.05). Abdominal trauma in this setting is associated with a significant amount of morbidity and mortality. Typical patients present late and with poor physiologic parameters often resulting in an undesirable outcome. There should be steps targeted at preventive policies focused on reducing the incidence of road traffic crashes, terrorism, and violent crimes as well as improving health care infrastructure to cater to this specific group of patients."

    "abstract": "Obturator hernia (OH) is a rare external abdominal hernia, accounting for only 0.07%-1% of all hernia cases. Because the female pelvis is wider and there is less preperitoneal adipose tissue, the obturator canal is larger, which can lead to herniation of abdominal contents when abdominal pressure increases in elderly women with thin body. The clinical symptoms of patients with obturator hernia included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, etc., and the mass in the inguinal region could not be touched. The positive Howship-Romberg sign is a specific sign of OH. CT is the first choice for the diagnosis of obturator hernia. Since intestinal incarceration in OH patients is prone to lead to intestinal necrosis, emergency surgical treatment is often required. However, due to the lack of specificity of its clinical manifestations, the misdiagnosis rate is high, which often leads to the delay of diagnosis and treatment. We report the case of an 86-year-old woman with a thin body and a history of multiple deliveries. The patient presented with abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation for 5 days. Physical examination revealed a positive Howship-Romberg sign on the right side, and CT examination suggested intestinal obstruction. Therefore, an urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed. After opening the abdominal cavity we found that the wall of the ileum was embedded in the right obturator, and the proximal bowel was significantly dilated. We restored the embedded bowel wall to its original position, resected the necrotic bowel and performed an end-to-end anastomosis of the small intestine. The right hernia orifice was sutured, and OH was diagnosed during the operation. This article summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of OH by sharing this case, so as to provide a more detailed plan for early diagnosis and treatment of OH."

The fistula was closed with a pericardial patch, although a dehiscence of the patch was detected in post-operative echocardiogram. The post-operative period was complicated by acute mediastinitis and cardiac tamponade secondary to a pericardial abscess, requiring emergent surgery. The patient made a good recovery afterwards and was discharged 2 weeks later. Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a very rare cause of endocarditis, although it can be very aggressive, with high degree of valve damage, necessity of surgery, and high mortality. It mainly affects young men with no previous structural heart disease. Due to its slow growth, blood cultures can be negative, so other microbiological techniques such as 16S RNA sequencing or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) can be helpful for diagnosis."

    "abstract": "In this study, we report the case of a 14-month-old female patient transferred from another hospital to our hospital with a 9-day history of fever and worsening dyspnea. Case Report. The patient tested positive for influenza type B virus 7 days before being transferred to our hospital but was never treated. The physical examination performed at presentation revealed redness and swelling of the skin at the site of the peripheral venous catheter insertion performed at the previous hospital. Her electrocardiogram revealed ST segment elevations in leads II, III, aVF, and V2-V6. An emergent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion. As ventricular dysfunction due to pericardial effusion was not present, pericardiocentesis was not performed. Furthermore, blood culture revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thus, a diagnosis of acute pericarditis complicated with sepsis and peripheral venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (PVC-BSI) due to MRSA was made. Frequent bedside ultrasound examinations were performed to evaluate the outcomes of the treatment. After administering vancomycin, aspirin, and colchicine, the patient's general condition stabilized. In children, it is crucial to identify the causative organism and provide appropriate targeted therapy to prevent worsening of the condition and mortality due to acute pericarditis. Moreover, it is important to carefully monitor the clinical course for the progression of acute pericarditis to cardiac tamponade and evaluate the treatment outcomes."

    "abstract": "Intradiploic arachnoid cysts are infrequent but benign lesions of the central nervous system. Etiologically, they can be non-traumatic or post-traumatic in origin. We present an unusual case of a post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cyst presented with recurrent meningitis episodes. A 68-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency department with fever and loss of consciousness, with a history of cranial operation due to a gunshot injury to the left occipital bone 45 years ago. On the patient's initial examination, nuchal rigidity was detected; Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs were positive. A lumbar puncture has been performed, and the patient is diagnosed with meningitis. The patient had been admitted to the emergency department with rhinorrhea after a minor blunt head trauma six years ago. As we understood from the patient's medical records, a couple of millimetric non-specified pneumocephalus areas, located next to the sella turcica, were detected on the cranial non-contrast-enhanced CT scan after the minor blunt trauma to the frontal bone. However, there was no sign of any obvious skull base fracture. The patient was hospitalized for five days and discharged on the sixth day without any complaints. After the discharge, the patient was admitted to other hospitals five times in the last five years with fever and anxiety. On all her admissions, the patient was diagnosed with CSF-culture-negative meningitis and treated with different unknown antibiotics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed some irregularities and thinning at the inner table of the left occipital bone; there was an enlargement of the diploic distance of the occipital bone on the left side. MR cisternography showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulizing areas just below the thickened and irregular part of the occipital bone. CSF fistula was communicated with the left lateral ventricle. The occipital horn of the left lateral ventricle was enlarged. We performed a surgical repair in order to cover the defective areas of the occipital and mastoid bones. The retromastoid approach was used. Pedunculated muscle flaps to cover the defective bony areas are used and secured with fibrin glue. There is no evidence of recurrence during the one-year follow-up period of the patient. We present this unusual case to emphasize that if post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cysts remain untreated, severe complications, such as episodes of recurrent meningitis, may occur. Although a few cases of these cysts are reported in the literature, a case of post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cyst presenting with recurrent meningitis has not been reported. In patients with recurrent meningitis, when no prominent etiology is found and if there is a trauma to the related bone in the patient's history, post-traumatic intradiploic arachnoid cyst should be included in the differential diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing emergent surgical procedures after penetrating trauma can benefit from postoperative imaging studies to identify potential missed injuries or indications to additional surgery. Aim of this study is to describe postoperative imaging findings in patients who underwent emergent operation for thoracic gunshot wounds (GSWs) and the subsequent need for further surgery, diagnostic evaluations or consults. Patients who survived to receive imaging evaluation after emergency surgery for penetrating chest trauma in a level I trauma center between 2017 and 2021 were included. Results of postoperative diagnostic evaluation were screened to determine their impact on the subsequent management. Overall, 125 patients admitted with a thoracic GSW underwent an emergent surgical procedure and 29 survived to receive postoperative imaging and were included. Postoperative CT-scan was performed in 26 (89.6%) patients, echocardiography in 8 (27.5%). Other tests included esophagoscopy (1) and bronchoscopy (1). Impact on management of abnormal imaging included a new indication to surgery or additional procedures in 7 cases and need for additional imaging or consults in other 8 cases. Bone fractures and lung injuries were more often diagnosed on postoperative CT-scan. In 3 patients, abnormal echocardiographic findings led to a second cardiac operation. Following emergency surgery for penetrating trauma, completion of injury assessment with CT-scan can lead to identification of missed or additional injuries, while other imaging is indicated according to operative findings. In this study, 24.1% had additional surgical pathology identified by postoperative imaging while others had findings requiring additional studies or specialist consult evaluations."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Agnathia-otocephaly complex (AOC) is a rare congenital malformation due to a first-branch arch disorder and has been considered lethal. However, milder variants of the isolated type of AOC have been reported as nonlethal. The ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedure is basically indicated for a fetus with a high risk of airway obstruction immediately after birth; it is not indicated for all AOC cases but is chosen to treat cases until the airway can be evaluated to achieve a better prognosis. CASE REPORT A 37-year-old woman was referred with reported fetal facial deformity and polyhydramnios at 27 weeks of gestation. Our fetal ultrasound scans showed agnathia, microstomia, and synotia, but not holoprosencephaly. Isolated AOC was diagnosed prenatally. Magnetic resonance imaging and microbubble tests revealed delayed fetal lung maturation, although it was not completely unmatured. With patient agreement, an emergency cesarean section with EXIT was performed because of clinical chorioamnionitis at 35 weeks of gestation. Tracheostomy was attempted for 16 min during EXIT and was completed 4 min after delivery. Despite this, the neonate died 12 h after delivery from severe respiratory failure and a tension pneumothorax caused by a hypoplastic lung. CONCLUSIONS There is controversy surrounding the non-lethality of all isolated AOC cases and the non-contraindication of EXIT procedures. Our case was estimated as the milder variant, and the EXIT procedure was indicated; however, the neonate died of the hypoplastic lung. The evaluation methods of lung maturation are inconsistent, and the indication of the invasive EXIT procedure must be carefully considered."

    "abstract": "Traumatic cervical spine (c-spine) injuries account for 10% of all spinal injuries. The c-spine is prone to injury by blunt acceleration/deceleration traumas. The Canadian C-Spine rule and NEXUS criteria guide clinical decision-making but lack consensus on imaging modality when necessary. This study aims to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of CT, MRI, X-Ray, and, for the first time, LODOX-Statscan in identifying c-spine injuries in patients with blunt trauma and neck pain. We conducted a retrospective monocenter cohort study using patient data from the emergency department at Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland's largest level one trauma center. We identified patients presenting with trauma and neck pain during the recruitment period from 01.01.2012 to 31.12.2017. We included all patients that required a radiographic c-spine evaluation according to the NEXUS criteria. Certified spine surgeons reviewed each case, analyzed patient demographics, injury classification, trauma mechanism, and emergency management. The retrospective full case review was established as gold standard to decide whether the c-spine was injured. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for CT, MRI, LODOX, and X-Ray imaging methods. We identified 4996 patients, of which 2321 met the inclusion criteria. 91.3% (n = 2120) patients received a CT scan, 8.9% (n = 206) a MRI, 9.3% (n = 215) an X-ray, and 21.5% (n = 498) a LODOX scan. By retrospective case review, 186 participants were classified as injured. The sensitivity of CT was 88.6% (specificity 99%), and 89.8% (specificity 99.2%) with orthopedic surgeon consultation. MRI had a sensitivity of 88.5% (specificity of 96.9%); highlighting 14 cases correctly diagnosed as injured by MRI and misdiagnosed by CT. Projection radiography (36.4% sensitivity, 95.1% specificity) and LODOX (5.3% sensitivity, 100% specificity) were unsuitable for ruling out spinal injury. While CT offers high sensitivity for detecting traumatic c-spine injury, MRI holds clinical significance in revealing injuries not recognized by CT in symptomatic patients. LODOX and projection radiography are insufficient for accurately ruling out c-spine injury. For patients with neurological symptoms, we recommend extended MRI use when CT scans are negative."

    "abstract": "Emergency department (ED) crowding is a worsening global problem caused by hospital capacity and other health system challenges. While patients across a broad spectrum of illnesses may be affected by crowding in the ED, patients with cardiovascular emergencies-such as acute coronary syndrome, malignant arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, acute aortic syndrome, and cardiac tamponade-are particularly vulnerable. Because of crowding, patients with dangerous and time-sensitive conditions may either avoid the ED due to anticipation of extended waits, leave before their treatment is completed, or experience delays in receiving care. In this educational paper, we present the underlying causes of crowding and its impact on common cardiovascular emergencies using the input-throughput-output process framework for patient flow. In addition, we review current solutions and potential innovations to mitigate the negative effect of ED crowding on patient outcomes."

She was transferred to our hospital with complaints of chest discomfort. Echocardiography revealed cardiac tamponade, and subsequently, a bloody pericardial effusion was drained. Coronary angiography and computed tomography revealed a ruptured left coronary artery aneurysm originating from a branch of the proximal left anterior descending artery and a coronary-pulmonary artery fistula. In the emergency operation, under cardiopulmonary bypass, the inlet and outlet vessels were ligated, and the aneurysm was closed without arresting the heart. By utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass, the pulmonary trunk was easily decompressed, and dissection around the aneurysm and identification of the inlet and outlet vessels was facilitated without cardiac arrest. Thus, to conclude, an on-pump beating-heart technique should be considered in such cases."

    "abstract": "The study aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of retrograde CTO intervention via collateral connection grade 0 (CC-0) septal channel and to identify predictors of collateral tracking failure. Guidewire crossing a collateral channel is a critical step for successful retrograde percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusion (CTO). Retrograde PCI was attempted in 122 cases of CTO with CC-0 septal collaterals from December 2018 to May 2021. A hydrophilic polymer coating guidewire was used for crossing all intended CC-0 collaterals. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of guidewire tracking failure via the CC-0 collaterals. Successful guidewire tracking via CC-0 septal channel was achieved in 98 (80.3%) of 122 cases. The independent predictors of CC-0 septal channel guidewire tracking failure included well-developed non-septal collateral (OR: 5.297, 95% CI: 1.107-25.353, p = 0.037) and the ratio length of posterior descending artery (PDA) versus the distance of PDA ostium to cardiac apex ≤2/3 (OR: 3.970, 95% CI: 1.454-10.835, p = 0.007). Collateral perforation, target vessel perforation, and cardiac tamponade occurred in 5 (4.1%), 3 (2.5%), and 6 (4.9%) cases, respectively. There were no complications requiring emergency cardiac surgery or revascularization of nontarget vessel. Retrograde PCI via CC-0 septal channels with a hydrophilic polymer-coated guidewire is feasible and safe in patients with CTO. Well-developed nonseptal collaterals and short PDA length influence the procedure success and the risk of guidewire tracking failure via CC-0 septal channels."

    "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) refers to the use of portable imaging performed by the provider clinician at the bedside for diagnostic, therapeutic, and procedural purposes. POCUS could be considered an extension of the physical examination but not a substitute for diagnostic imaging. Use of POCUS in emergency situations can be lifesaving in the NICU if performed in a timely fashion for cardiac tamponade, pleural effusions, pneumothorax, etc, with potential for enhancing quality of care and improving outcomes. In the past 2 decades, POCUS has gained significant acceptance in clinical medicine in many parts of the world and in many subspecialties. Formal accredited training and certification programs are available for neonatology trainees as well as for many other subspecialties in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Although no formal training program or certification is available to neonatologists in Europe, POCUS is widely available to providers in NICUs. A formal institutional POCUS fellowship is now available in Canada. In the United States, many clinicians have the skills to perform POCUS and have incorporated it in their daily clinical practice. However, appropriate equipment remains limited, and many barriers exist to POCUS program implementation. Recently, the first international evidence-based POCUS guidelines for use in neonatology and pediatric critical care were published. Considering the potential benefits, a recent national survey of neonatologists confirmed that the majority of clinicians were inclined to adopt POCUS in their clinical practice if the barriers could be resolved. This technical report describes many potential POCUS applications in the NICU for diagnostic and procedural purposes."

    "abstract": "Some reports suggest Diagnostic peritoneal aspiration (DPA) or lavage (DPL) may better select which hypotensive blunt trauma patients (BTPs) require operation, compared to ultrasonography. However, whether both moderately hypotensive (systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 90 mmHg) and severely hypotensive (SBP < 70 mmHg) patients benefit from DPA/DPL is unclear. We hypothesized DPA/DPL used within the first hour increases risk of death for severely vs moderately hypotensive BTPs. The 2017-2019 Trauma Quality Improvement Program database was queried for BTPs ≥ 18 years old with hypotension upon arrival. We compared moderately and severely hypotensive groups. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed controlling for age, comorbidities, emergent operation, blood transfusions, and injury profile. From 134 hypotensive patients undergoing DPA/DPL, 66 (49.3%) had severe hypotension. Patients in both groups underwent an emergent operation (43.9% vs 58.8%, P = .09) in a similar amount of time (median, 42-min vs 54-min, P = .11). Compared to the moderately hypotensive group, severely hypotensive patients had a higher rate and associated risk of death (84.8% vs 50.0%, P < .001) (OR 5.40, CI 2.07-14.11, P < .001). The strongest independent risk factor for death was age ≥ 65 (OR 24.81, CI 4.06-151.62, P < .001). Among all BTPs undergoing DPA/DPL within the first hour of arrival, an over 5-fold increased risk of death for patients with severe hypotension was demonstrated. As such, DPA/DPL within this group should be used with caution, particularly for older patients, as they may be better served by immediate surgeries. Future prospective research is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the ideal DPA/DPL population in the modern era of ultrasonography."

    "abstract": "Bladder rupture is an uncommon injury that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Though occurring mostly due to trauma, this life-threatening pathology may also occur spontaneously or after a procedure such as transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Computed tomography (CT) cystography is the standard imaging modality for diagnosis. However, this test is unlikely to be ordered in a patient with undifferentiated abdominal pain unless there is specific suspicion for this diagnosis. In our emergency department, a 48 year-old male with history of bladder cancer and TURBT two weeks prior to arrival presented with severe abdominal pain and difficulty urinating for 3 days. Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed an irregularly shaped bladder, likely site of bladder rupture, and large amount of abdominal free fluid with sediment. These findings prompted an expedited diagnostic CT scan with cystography. Emergent exploratory laparotomy ultimately confirmed a small bladder defect with 2.5 L of urinary ascites. The diagnosis of non-traumatic bladder rupture can be overlooked in patients presenting with a peritonitic abdominen. The typically ordered test for such patients is standard CT, which carries a high false-negative rate for bladder rupture. This case highlights the utility of POCUS in facilitating a rapid diagnosis."

We present a case of the first documented case of Arcobacter spp. isolated in pericardial fluid in an immunocompromised patient with worsening cardiac tamponade that was successfully managed with an urgent pericardiocentesis and ensuing steroids, antibiotics, and a pericardial drain. The patient had a past medical history of HIV, latent syphilis, PCP pneumonia, ESRD, and hypertension, and presented with worsening dyspnea, subjective fever, myalgias, cough, pleuritic chest pain, and pericardial rub. Diagnostic workup revealed a positive COVID-19 PCR test, elevated high-sensitive cardiac troponins, elevated CRP, elevated D-dimer, and elevated creatinine. An ECG revealed diffuse ST-segment elevation, and imaging showed cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion and diffuse interstitial edema. Urgent TTE showed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology present. Culture on aerobic blood agar grew Arcobacter spp. of unknown specific species, and blood cultures were also positive for Arcobacter spp. Treatment involved intravenous meropenem for five days, followed by oral ciprofloxacin, low-dose colchicine, and a tapered dose of ibuprofen. Repeat laboratory data and TTE showed complete resolution of the pericardial effusion and improved left ventricular function. This case highlights the potential for Arcobacter spp. to cause severe infections and the importance of considering it as a possible pathogen in patients with atypical presentations."

This study aimed to investigate the utility of repeated extended focused abdominal sonography for trauma (rE-FAST) performed by the emergency physician in patients with stable blunt thoracoabdominal trauma. This was a prospective, single-center diagnostic accuracy study. Patients with blunt thoracoabdominal trauma admitted to the ED were included in the study. The E-FAST was performed on the patients included in the study at the 0th h, the 3rd h, and the 6th h during their follow-up. Then, the diagnostic accuracy metrics of E-FAST and rE-FAST were calculated. The sensitivity and specificity of E-FAST in determining thoracoabdominal pathologies were found to be 75% and 98.7%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for specific pathologies were 66.7% and 100% for pneumothorax, 66.7% and 98.8% for hemothorax, and 66.7% and 100% for hemoperitoneum, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of rE-FAST in determining thoracal and/or abdominal hemorrhage in stable patients were found to be 100% and 98.7%, respectively. E-FAST successfully rules in thoracoabdominal pathologies in patients with blunt trauma, with its high specificity. However, only a rE-FAST might be sensitive enough to exclude traumatic pathologies in these stable patients."

An abdominal ultrasound showed intrauterine retained products of conception measuring 5x5 cm. She was admitted as a case of incomplete miscarriage and underwent an evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPOC) immediately. A post-procedure computed tomography (CT) scan done showed the presence of multiple large uterine fibroids. The patient continued to worsen clinically with complaints of abdominal pain and diarrhea. Further laboratory tests revealed a continuous rise in inflammatory markers with positive stool clostridium toxins. She was hence shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as a case of sepsis. In the following days, she developed signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction, and the diagnosis was supported by abdominal X-rays. Despite starting her on conservative management for the same, she deteriorated clinically, and a repeat CT abdomen showed new signs of small bowel obstruction. The gynecology team performed an exploratory laparotomy during which a myomectomy was done. The patient recovered well post-operatively and was discharged in a stable condition. In view of the presented case, small bowel obstruction should be considered as a complication of uterine fibroids in females with a history of large leiomyomas despite it being quite rare as it can cause considerable morbidity and mortality."

Infection with Listeria monocytogenes in twin pregnancy is rare but devastating, which puts forwards a great challenge for clinical management. Here, a 24-year-old woman was diagnosed with twin pregnancy, intrauterine death of one fetus and fever at 29+4 week of gestation. Two days later, she developed into pericardial effusion, pneumonedema and potential septic shock. The emergent cesarean delivery was performed after anti-shock treatment. One alive and another dead fetus were delivered. Then, she developed postpartum hemorrhage after the surgery. Urgent exploratory laparotomy was conducted at the sites of cesarean section and B-Lynch suture to stop bleeding. The culture of blood and maternal side of both placentas indicated Listeria monocytogenes. Following anti-infection therapy with ampicillin-sulbactam, she recovered well and discharged with negative result of blood bacterial culture and normal inflammatory indicators. The patient was hospitalized for a total of 18 days including 2 days in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the anti-infection treatment was conducted throughout the course. Symptoms of the Listeria monocytogenes infection in pregnancy are non-specific, which should be paid more attention in case of unexplained fever and fetal distress. The blood culture is effective for accurate diagnosis. Listeria monocytogenes infection is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Close monitoring of fetal condition, early intervention with antibiotics, timely termination of pregnancy and comprehensive management of complications are essential for better prognosis."

    "abstract": "Adnexal masses affect 2-10% of all pregnancies. The highest incidence of 1-6% can be seen in the first trimester, with a high rate of spontaneous remission. Two percent of these masses are malignant neoplasms or borderline tumors. A rare benign mass of the adnexa in pregnancy is hyperreactio luteinalis characterised by bilateral, multicystic ovaries with a frequent occurrence in the 3rd trimester. Clinical signs include maternal hyperandrogenaemia with virilisation, hyperemesis, nonspecific abdominal pain or laboratory findings of hyperthyroidism and elevated ß-HCG. Hyperreactio luteinalis does not require therapy due to complete spontaneous remission postpartum, but is often treated surgically in graviditate. In our case we report a first-time gravida in the 31st week of pregnancy with a symptomatic 25-cm multicystic, partly solid mass. After antenatal corticosteroid therapy, an exploratory laparotomy with right adnexectomy was performed on suspicion of malignancy. Histology revealed a hyperreactio luteinalis with an incidental finding of a serous borderline tumor of the ovary (FIGO IIIB). At 33 weeks of gestation, a pathological CTG was observed, and an urgent secondary caesarean section by re-longitudinal laparotomy was performed. Postpartum completion surgery revealed no further neoplastic cells. Raumforderungen der Adnexe betreffen 2–10% aller Schwangerschaften. Die höchste Inzidenz mit 1–6% lässt sich im ersten Trimenon beobachten, bei hoher Spontanremission im Schwangerschaftsverlauf. Bei 2% dieser Raumforderungen handelt es sich um maligne Neoplasien oder Borderline-Tumore. Eine seltene benigne Raumforderung der Adnexe in der Schwangerschaft ist die Hyperreactio luteinalis. Sie ist gekennzeichnet durch bilaterale, multizystisch veränderte Ovarien mit einem gehäuften Auftreten im 3. Trimenon. Klinisch zeigen sich u. a. eine maternale Hyperandrogenämie mit Virilisierung, Hyperemesis, unspezifische Bauchschmerzen oder laborchemisch eine Hyperthyreose sowie ein erhöhtes ß-HCG. Die Hyperreactio luteinalis bedarf keiner Therapie bei kompletter Remission postpartal, wird jedoch oft in graviditate operativ behandelt. In unserem Fall berichten wir von einer Erstgravida in der 31. Schwangerschaftswoche (SSW) mit einer symptomatischen 25 cm großen multizystischen, teils soliden Raumforderung. Bei Malignitätsverdacht erfolgte nach abgeschlossener Lungenreifung eine Explorativlaparotomie mit rechtsseitiger Adnexektomie. Histologisch ergab sich eine Hyperreactio luteinalis mit Zufallsbefund eines serösen Borderline-Tumor des Ovars FIGO IIIB. Bei pathologischem CTG erfolgte in der 33. Schwangerschaftswoche eine eilige sekundäre Sectio per Re-Längslaparotomie. Post partum entschloss sich die Patientin nach reproduktionsmedizinischer und onkologischer Beratung zur Komplettierungsoperation, wobei sich histologisch kein weiterer Nachweis des vordiagnostizierten serösen Borderlinetumors fand."

    "title": "Value of Thoracic CT in Blunt Trauma Patients With High Glasgow Coma Scale and Low Injury Severity Scale.",
    "abstract": "To determine the value of ordering a routine chest CT (CCT) in patients with blunt trauma presenting to the emergency department with a high GCS and low ISS, we retrospectively collected patient data including CT scan results, when physical examination and initial chest X-ray were normal in the trauma bay area. A retrospective data collection of 901 consecutive blunt trauma patients seen in the ED between 2017 and 2019 was analyzed. Data included physical examination, age, gender, current use of anticoagulation therapy, comorbid conditions, as well as the result of radiologic images, hospital length of stay, surgical intervention, and mortality. The patients were divided into two groups: group one (patients with negative physical examination; chest x-ray and CT) and group 2 (negative physical examination, positive or negative chest x-ray, and positive CT). Statistical analysis was performed using student's t-test and chi-square test. Of the 901 patients there were 489 (54%) males and 412 (46%) females with a mean age of 56 years. There were 461 patients who had a physical examination, chest x-ray, abdominal and CCT done. Group one included 442 (96%) patients, with negative physical examination, negative chest X-ray and CT scan. In group 2, 19 (4%) patients who had positive CT and or chest x-ray. Both groups were similar in GCS and ISS. Of the 19 patients, sixteen patients had a positive CCT, and thirteen of those had a positive chest x-ray. In the three patients who had negative physical examination and chest x-ray, the CT findings included one with a nondisplaced 10th rib fracture and two patients with osteoporotic compression fractures of dorsal vertebrae. The rate of both chest x-ray and CCT being positive among a group of screened patients was 16% (3/19) and the rate of a negative chest x-ray but positive CT was 16% (3/19). The odds ratio between the two outcomes was one. In blunt trauma patients presenting to the ED with a high GCS and low ISS score, when initial physical examination and chest x-ray are negative, routine CCT is of little value."

    "abstract": "Traumatic abdominal wall hernia (TAWH) also known as blunt abdominal TAWH is uncommon. The clinical diagnosis is difficult. The authors present a case report of posthigh-energy abdominal blunt trauma causing a TAWH. A 36-year-women, with unremarkable past medical history, was presented to the Emergency Department after a stuck in high-speed two automobiles. She was hemodynamic, respiratory, and neurologically stable. The BMI was 36 kg/m². The abdomen was not distended with an ecchymotic lesion on the right flank. The thoracic abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a rupture in the lateral abdominal wall muscles with a TAWH in the location of the skin ecchymoses. There was no visceral lesion or intraperitoneal fluid. A conservative treatment was indicated. The follow-up was uneventful, with hematoma resorption and no cellulitis or abscess. The patient was discharged after 1 week. An abdominal repair will be planned using a mesh. TAWH is a rare entity. The best imaging modality for diagnosis is the CT scan allowing classification of the hernia and a screen for other injuries. The presence of an isolated TAWH must lower the threshold to closely monitor or to operatively explore, given the high rate of false-negative findings at imaging features. TAWH should be suspected behind any blunt abdominal trauma with high energy. CT scan and ultrasound were helpful for diagnosis and the only curative treatment is surgery to avoid complications."

    "abstract": "Hydatid cyst is a parasitic disease that is transmitted from animals to humans caused by the larval stage Echinococcus, especially Echinococcus granulosus. A complication of a hydatid cyst of the liver is its rupture, either traumatic or spontaneously. A 19-year-old male presented with an acute abdomen for 12 h. After clinical assessment, contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a rupture of the anterior wall of the hepatic hydatid cyst with intra-abdominal and pelvic dissemination. Exploratory laparotomy was performed with the evacuation of the daughter cyst and peritoneal lavage. The patient recovered well and was discharged with albendazole therapy. Hydatid cyst rupture is a rare but serious complication. Computed tomography has high sensitivity in demonstrating cyst rupture. The patient underwent laparotomy, where disseminated cysts were evacuated, and the anterior wall of the cyst was deroofed, along with the removal of a ruptured laminated membrane. Emergency surgery plus albendazole therapy are recommended protocols for cases like ours. A patient from an endemic region with acute presentation of right upper quadrant pain can have spontaneously ruptured hydatidosis as a differential diagnosis. Intraperitoneal rupture and dissemination of hydatid cysts of the liver can be life-threatening if intervention is delayed. Immediate surgery is life-saving and prevents complications."

    "abstract": "Following the \"rule of 2\", Meckel's Diverticulum (MD) is 2 inches or 5cm long. However, we report the case of an extremely large MD. To the best of our elucidated literature search, it is the first case of Giant Meckel's Diverticulum (GMD) from Pakistan presenting with post-traumatic hemoperitoneum. A 25-year-old Pakistani male presented to a surgical emergency with a two-hour history of generalized abdominal pain after blunt abdominal trauma. An exploratory laparotomy was carried out due to the deranged hemodynamic parameters and free fluid in the abdominopelvic cavity, revealing a 35 centimeters long MD with a bleeding vessel on its tip. Diverticulectomy with the repair of a small intestinal defect was performed after the evacuation of 2.5 liters of clotted blood. Histologic evaluation revealed ectopic gastric tissue. He had an uneventful post-operative stay and was discharged home. The current English scientific literature has adequate case reports documenting the complications of perforation, intestinal obstruction, and diverticulitis of Meckel's Diverticulum (MD) of normal length. However, this case report highlights the significance of an MD with an abnormal length which put the patient's life at risk of death in the setting of normal intra-operative anatomy of all other abdominal organs."

    "abstract": "Olmesartan is a relatively new angiotensin receptor blocker used widely to control hypertension. Cases have been reported previously of enteropathy induced by olmesartan. Here, the authors report a case of olmesartan-induced ischemic enteritis complicated by bowel perforation. A 52-year-old male patient, during the treatment with olmesartan, developed severe abdominal pain of five-day duration. He underwent exploratory laparotomy for bowel perforation and surgical resection of the ischemic bowel segment. On a two-month follow-up after the discontinuation of olmesartan and the emergency surgery, the patient was symptom-free and functioning well. This rare report focuses on ischemic enteritis associated with olmesartan, describes the symptoms, and records the progression of this side effect and the corresponding treatment. Our case aims to raise awareness amongst physicians about the possibility of this severe complication and to point out that more research is still needed on its pathophysiology to better understand this drug."

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that point-of-care ultrasound could help to evaluate and diagnose pediatric skull fracture for the closed scalp hematoma from blunt trauma. However, relevant data in Chinese children are missing, especially in children 0-6 years old. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of point-of-care ultrasound to diagnose skull fracture in children 0-6 years old with scalp hematoma in China. We performed a prospective observational study and screened children 0-6 years old with closed scalp hematoma and a Glasgow coma scale of 14-15 at Hospital in China. Enrolled children (N = 152) were first evaluated for skull fracture with point-of-care ultrasound by the emergency physician and then received a head computed tomography scan. The point-of-care ultrasound examination and computed tomography scan revealed skull fracture in 13 (8.6%) and 12 (7.9%) children, respectively. The kappa test showed a satisfactory agreement between two examinations (P < 0.0001), with kappa = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, i.e., 95% CI, [0.69, 1.00]) and area under the curve = 0.95 (95% CI [0.86, 1], P < 0.0001). The point-of-care ultrasound examination had the sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI [62.5%, 100%]), specificity of 98.6% (95% CI [94.6%, 100%]), positive predictive value of 84.6% (95% CI [56.5%, 96.9%]), negative predictive value of 99.2% (95% CI [95.6%, 100%]), and accuracy of 98.0% (95% CI [94.1%, 99.6%]). While our study is preliminary in nature, our findings may guide future larger studies in assessing the utility of point-of-care ultrasound examination in diagnosing skull fractures in children with scalp hematoma from minor head trauma."

    "abstract": "With laparoscopic surgery becoming more popular in surgical practice, laparoscopic approaches in trauma patients have increased. Non-operative management is the standard treatment algorithm in patients with blunt abdominal trauma who are hemodynamically stable and have sustained a liver injury. However, laparoscopy is a safe and feasible method for exploration, irrigation, and treatment if a surgical intervention is needed in this group. In this study, we aimed to present a case of liver injury in blunt abdominal trauma and its management laparoscopically. A 22-year-old male was admitted to the Marmara University Hospital's Emergency Unit of a tertiary center following a truck accident. The patient was hemodynamically stable at admission. CT scan showed a grade IV liver laceration with hemoperitoneum. The patient was transferred to the observation room. After three hours, the patient's hemoglobin value decreased from 14.6 g/dl to 8.4 g/dl, and the mean arterial blood pressure decreased to 60 mmHg. The patient's heart rate increased to 125, and peritonitis was evident on the abdominal examination. Emergent laparoscopy was performed on the patient. Grade IV liver laceration with no active bleeding was observed. After peritoneal irrigation, surgery was terminated. With the developments in minimally invasive procedures, laparoscopic approaches were used more frequently in trauma patients. In the referral and experienced centers, laparoscopy could be an appropriate way to avoid unnecessary laparotomies."

    "abstract": "Cardiac cysticercosis is rare in clinical practice and is usually accidentally identified during cardiac surgery or autopsies. Although mostly asymptomatic, cardiac cysticercosis could present with severe clinical conditions such as myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. We present a 51-year-old female patient who accidentally discovered a solitary mass in the myocardium. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed a nonenhanced cyst in the interventricular septum protruding into the right ventricular chamber. Because of cardiac tamponade presenting during a right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, an emergency open-heart surgery was performed to suture the ventricular wall perforation and remove the tumor. The histopathologic report demonstrated typical cysticercosis. Cardiac cysticercosis is an uncommon lesion and may present with atypical clinical and laboratory features. Therefore, this diagnosis should be considered single or multiple cardiac cystic lesions."

In this article, we present a rare case of purulent pericarditis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A 67-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a large pericardial effusion with evidence of cardiac tamponade caused by acute pericarditis. The patient underwent surgical pericardial drainage, and a total volume of 500 mL of purulent fluid was collected with a positive culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite antituberculous drugs, the patient presented with clinical worsening and recurrence of large pericardial effusion. Therefore, he was submitted to a second intervention by full median sternotomy to drain the pericardial effusion and perform a surgical pericardial debridement associated with a partial pericardiectomy. After the procedure, he improved clinically and was discharged after 24 days of hospitalization. Pericardiectomy is recommended for patients with refractory tuberculous pericarditis after four to eight weeks of antituberculous treatment. We decided not to wait that long to perform an open surgical partial pericardiectomy and debridement with a median sternotomy approach. We believe that this more aggressive surgical approach would be more efficient to combat the infection, which was causing progressive deterioration of patient's clinical condition and early recurrence of significant pericardial effusion. Open partial pericardiectomy with surgical debridement could be an efficient approach for treatment of a refractory acute tuberculous pericarditis."

The data was compared between the three restriction levels and the proportion of attendances during the study period was compared with the pre-pandemic study (December 2016 to February 2018). the average age was 35.5 years, 86.1% of the patients were male and 61.6% of the attendances were due to blunt injury. The highest average of attendances per day occurred during the \"yellow\" restriction level (2.9), however there was no significant difference when comparing the restriction periods two by two. There was also no significant difference either in the analysis of the standardized residuals of the proportions of aggressions or the mechanism of aggression in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. there was a predominance of attendances due to blunt trauma and in young male patients.

In rare cases, patients with appendicitis can suffer complications such as intestinal obstruction. These particular cases of occlusive appendicitis with a periappendicular abscess usually occur in elderly patients and can develop in an aggressive form, nonetheless with a favorable evolution. We present a case of an 80-year-old male patient, reporting symptoms similar to an occlusive digestive pathology: abdominal pain, intestinal transit disorders, and fecal vomiting. A computerized tomography scan suggested a mechanical bowel obstruction. The patient had an exploratory laparotomy indication to find the cause of the obstruction. The peritoneal cavity inspection revealed an occlusive form of acute gangrenous appendicitis with a periappendicular abscess. An appendectomy was performed. In conclusion, as surgeons, we must always take into consideration that acute appendicitis can represent a cause of intestinal obstruction, especially in elderly patients."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy (SHiP) refers to fluid collection in the abdominal cavity with a vague presentation of clinical symptoms. Particularly, SHiP causes a life-threatening condition with the coexistence of intrauterine pregnancy, since this dangerous complication significantly increases the maternal and fetal mortality. Herein, we present two cases of nontraumatic SHiP in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, respectively. The pregnant woman in case 1 was admitted to our hospital owing to severe paroxysmal shoulder pain along with abdominal pain. Her medical history was remarkably recorded with endometriosis and adenomyosis. At the emergency room, an ultrasound scan revealed a live fetus corresponding to 21 weeks and 3 days and free fluid in the abdominal cavity. She was subsequently diagnosed with SHiP and underwent immediate laparotomy for hemostatic procedures. During the postpartum course, the patient was uneventfully monitored. Unfortunately, the patient delivered on the 4th postoperative day in spite of the initial administration of tocolytic agents and close monitoring. The primigravid woman in case 2 complained of lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. The patient's history was noted with ovarian tumor removal. At admission, the sonography scan revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity, a fetus at 34 weeks and 3 days gestational age with bradycardia of 70 bpm, and a laboratory test showed a low hemoglobin level. Thus, exploratory laparotomy and hysterotomy were performed at the same time due to fetal distress. The postpartum course was uneventful. The patient was discharged 5 days later. In pregnant women with a history of endometriosis, adenomyosis, or ovarian tumor removal, acute abdominal pain combined with the presence of free fluid collection in the intraperitoneal cavity, and a decreased hemoglobin levels should be first assessed as SHiP originating from the spontaneous rupture of abnormal vascular proliferation. Proper management is strongly indicated for an emergent laparotomy to control the active bleeding point, thus increasing the survival rate for both mother and neonate."

    "title": "Comprehensive Management of the Patient With Traumatic Cardiac Injury.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac injuries are rare but potentially life-threatening, with a significant proportion of victims dying before arrival at the hospital. The in-hospital mortality among patients who arrive in-hospital alive also remains significantly high, despite major advancements in trauma care including the continuous updating of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program. Stab and gunshot wounds due to assault or self-inflicted injuries are the common causes of penetrating cardiac injuries, while motor vehicular accidents and fall from height are attributable causes of blunt cardiac injury. Rapid transport of victim to trauma care facility, prompt recognition of cardiac trauma by clinical evaluation and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, quick decision-making to perform emergency department thoracotomy, and/or shifting the patient expeditiously to the operating room for operative intervention with ongoing resuscitation are the key components for a successful outcome in cardiac injury victims with cardiac tamponade or exsanguinating hemorrhage. Blunt cardiac injury with arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, or cardiac failure may need continuous cardiac monitoring or anesthetic care for operative procedure of other associated injuries. This mandates a multidisciplinary approach working in concert with agreed local protocols and shared goals. An anesthesiologist has a pivotal role to play as a team leader or member in the trauma pathway of severely injured patients. They are not only involved in in-hospital care as a perioperative physician but also participate in the organizational aspects of prehospital trauma systems and training of prehospital care providers/paramedics. There is sparse literature available on the anesthetic management of cardiac injury (penetrating as well as blunt) patients. This narrative review discusses the comprehensive management of cardiac injury patients, focusing on the anesthetic concerns and is guided by our experience in managing cardiac injury cases at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. JPNATC is the only level 1 trauma center in north India, providing services to a population of approximately 30 million with around 9000 operations being performed annually."

Our preoperative diagnosis was gastrocolic fistula secondary to acute on chronic pancreatitis, which was managed by emergency exploratory laparotomy, resection, and anastomosis. Histopathological examination was successful in confirming the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Through this case report, we intend to draw surgeons' and physicians' attention to gastrointestinal mucormycosis, an emerging cause of gastric necrosis in young patients in the post-coronavirus disease era, and that physicians need to be more aware of the consequent high mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis followed by aggressive debridement, antifungal therapy, and managing the underlying disease is the most efficient way to reduce mortality associated with the disease."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Tension pneumothorax (TP) is a medical emergency resulting in air accumulation in the pleural cavity of the affected side. Later, this air applies pressure on the mediastinal structures, leading to a shift of these structures toward the contralateral side. This shift results in a picture of obstructive shock with a possibly fatal consequence if not detected and treated early. Treatment should not await radiological confirmation, and the red flags in the history and physical examination are enough to proceed with decompressing the affected hemithorax with a large-bore needle. Usually, patients with TP present to the Emergency Department with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, but rare presentations are still possible. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 24-year-old male patient with TP who presented to the Emergency Department with severe epigastric abdominal pain with a clinical picture of acute pancreatitis. X-ray showed a right-sided TP. Immediately, we performed a needle decompression followed by chest tube insertion. Four days later, the patient was discharged home uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS In this case report, we aim to draw the attention of physicians in the Emergency Department to the need to consider the possibility of upper abdominal pain elicited by chest pathologies. Furthermore, we need to investigate the effect of TP on coronary perfusion."

Urgent clinical evaluation, ultrasound, temporizing pericardiocentesis or surgical repair with cardiopulmonary bypass as back up consist of standard management. In this paper, experience of management of penetrating cardiac injury from a resource limited country is presented. There were seven patients, five had a stab injury and two had gunshot wound. All were men with mean age of 31.1 years. Patients arrived within 30 min (3), 2 h (2), 4 h (1) and 18 h (1) after injury. Mean initial blood pressure and pulse rates were 83/51 mm Hg and 121, respectively. One patient had pericardiocentesis before referral. Exploration was via left anterolateral thoracotomy. Four (57.1 %) had right ventricle perforation, one had both right and left ventricle, and two (28.5 %) had left ventricle perforation. Suture repair (6) and pericardial patch (1) were done without bypass machine as back up. Mean duration of stay in the intensive care unit and in the surgical wards were 4.4 days (range: 2-15) and 10.8 days (range: 1-48), respectively. All were discharged improved. Penetrating cardiac injury presents with low blood pressure and tachycardia after stab or gunshot wounds. Right ventricle is mostly affected. Pericardiocentesis can be done as temporary measure. While having bypass machine as back up is recommended, the absence of it should not preclude intervention. Suture repair can be done with left anterolateral thoracotomy. Penetrating cardiac injury can be managed in resource limited settings without back up of cardiopulmonary bypass. Early identification and surgical intervention results in favorable outcome."

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics-including age, sex, date of emergency room (ER) visit, time of injury, trauma mechanism (car accident, motorcycle accident, bicycle accident, pedestrian accident, fall, slipping and rolling down, crush injury, assault, and others), final diagnosis, injury severity score, abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score, and injury site-of 1,245 patients in a tertiary trauma center. There was a strong correlation between certain injury sites and specific trauma mechanisms. In particular, most trauma mechanisms were associated with injury to the head and neck, as well as the chest, with a combined frequency of >40.0%. Moreover, when using one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni's post hoc tests, there were significant differences in AIS scores 1, 3, 4, and 5 for each trauma mechanism. Generally, when patients with severe injury present to the ER, the injury site can be predicted upon initial assessment based on the trauma mechanism. Based on our study, the injury site predicted by a specific mechanism should be checked repeatedly and additionally through physical examination and imaging tools. This can reduce misdiagnosis and help with accurate diagnosis and treatment."

    "title": "Case report: CAR-T cell therapy-induced cardiac tamponade.",
    "abstract": "CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has recently been shown to improve the prognosis of refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, CAR-T cells may induce numerous adverse events, in particular cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which is frequently associated with cardiovascular manifestations. Among the latter, acute pericardial effusion represents less than 1% of cases and cardiac tamponade has only been reported once. The management and outcome of these severe complications are not well established. We report here, a case of cardiac tamponade associated with CRS in a context of CAR-T cell therapy, which required urgent pericardiocentesis. A 65-year-old man with refractory DLBCL was treated with CAR-T cell therapy. He had a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction and transient atrial fibrillation. A pericardial localization of the lymphoma was observed on the second relapse. One day after CAR-T cell infusion the patient was diagnosed with grade 1 CRS. Due to hypotension, he was treated with tocilizumab and dexamethasone, and then transferred to intensive care unit (ICU). Echocardiography performed at ICU admission showed acute pericardial effusion with signs of right ventricular heart failure due to cardiac tamponade. It was decided to perform pericardiocentesis despite grade IV thrombocytopenia in a context of aplasia. Analysis of pericardial fluid showed a large number of lymphoma cells and 73% of CAR-T cells amongst lymphocytes, a level that was similar in blood. Hemodynamic status improved after pericardiocentesis, and no recurrence of pericardial effusion was observed. The presence of a high count of activated CAR-T cells in the pericardial fluid as well as the short interval between CAR-T cells injection and the symptoms appear as potential arguments for a direct action of CAR-T cells in the mechanism of this adverse event. The patient was discharged from ICU after two days and initially exhibited a good response to DLBCL treatment. Unfortunately, he died fifty days after starting CAR-T cell therapy due to a new DLBCL relapse. Patients with a pericardial localization of DLBCL should be assessed for a risk of cardiac tamponade if receiving CAR-T cell therapy and presenting CRS. In this case, cardiac tamponade seems directly related to CAR-T cell expansion. Pericardiocentesis should be considered as a feasible and effective treatment if the risk of bleeding is well controlled, in association with anti-IL6 and corticosteroids."

The observational, analytical, cross-sectional study was conducted at the surgical ward of Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan from July 1, 2020, to June 31, 2021, and comprised patients who presented in the emergency department after blunt trauma to abdomen without any open wound. Findings of hollow visceral injury were confirmed on exploration laparotomy. Data was analysed using SPSS 26. Of the 216 patients, 173(80.9%) were male and 43(19.9%) were female. The overall mean age was 42±9.7 years. Most of the blunt trauma abdomen cases were caused by motor vehicle accidents 59(27.3%). The most common hollow viscus affected was jejunum 42(19.4%), followed by transverse colon 29(13.4%). The most common type of injury observed was single complete disruption of hollow viscus 74(34.2%). The most common hollow organ affected by blunt trauma to the abdomen was jejunum, followed by transverse colon, and motor vehicle accidents were the major cause of these injuries."

We report the case of a 67-year-old male patient, who presented with severe abdominal pain and reduced oral intake, causing dehydration and impaired kidney function. The imaging evaluation including arterial Doppler and computed tomography (CT) scan showed AMI caused by superior mesenteric artery (SMA) obstruction and celiac artery stenosis, besides multiple atherosclerotic segments. Given the absence of guidelines in such an uncommon combination, a multidisciplinary management was initiated involving general medicine, general surgery, vascular surgery, and radiology. The agreed plan consisted of anticoagulation, exploratory laparotomy with necrosis resection and anastomosis, followed by percutaneous thrombectomy and angioplasty with stenting. The patient was discharged on day 7 postop with a highly satisfactory outcome and follow up. This case highlights the value of an early multidisciplinary approach in tailoring the management to the specific case of AMI."

    "abstract": "Cholecystoenteric fistulas occur as a result of a chronic inflammatory insult involving the gallbladder and the erosion of both its wall and a bowel segment. When the fistula develops, it creates a pathway for gallstones to migrate and cause an intestinal obstruction, known as gallstone ileus. When it obstructs the gastric outlet, a proximal variant of gallstone ileus occurs, known as Bouveret's syndrome. A 65-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of epigastric and right upper quadrant pain and persistent vomiting, preceded by unintentional weight loss of 15 kg over three months. Endoscopic and complementary imaging studies identified a concurrent gastric outlet obstruction caused by a lodged gallstone in the duodenal bulb and gallstone ileus. The patient underwent an urgent exploratory laparotomy and was submitted to an enterolithotomy and gastrolithotomy. Due to a sudden deterioration on the fourth postoperative day, he underwent an emergent re-laparotomy that found fecal peritonitis and complete dehiscence of both closures. The patient was then managed with damage control surgery. An atypical gastric resection and enterectomy of the distal ileum were performed and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit in temporary abdominal closure (laparostomy). The patient failed to improve and died on the same day. Ultimately, the patient's multiple comorbidities, including morbid obesity, malnutrition, and diabetes, contributed to poor tissue healing and the fatal outcome. Gallstone ileus and Bouveret's syndrome are two rare complications of cholecystoduodenal fistulas that have not yet been reported to occur simultaneously. Both intestinal and gastric obstruction makes the surgical approach the first-line treatment."

In this case report, the foreign body was visualized to be lodged in between the left atrium and ventricle. After that, an emergency open heart surgery was performed. Post-intervention, the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit without ionotropic support and with stable haemodynamics. Cardiac foreign bodies are rarely seen because most patients with penetrating cardiac injuries die from hemorrhagic shock or cardiac tamponade. We report a case of a penetrating injury into the thorax with the foreign body being lodged into the pericardium and then managed surgically.

We performed a retrospective study to characterize OE in lung cancer patients admitted to the pulmonology department to determine the effects of the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. A total number of 82 patients were admitted with an emergency, mostly brain metastasis (n=37; 45.1%), followed by superior vena cava syndrome (n=13; 15.9%), cardiac tamponade (n=7; 8.5%), large pleural effusion (n=7; 8.5%), severe pulmonary embolism (n=6; 7.3%), spinal cord syndrome (n=6; 7.3%), massive hemoptysis (n=3; 3.7%), stridor (n=2; 2.4%) and atelectasis (n=1; 1.2%). Clinical and pathological data were retrieved from clinical charts including demographic information, smoking status, cancer histology, clinical stage at diagnosis, anticancer treatment, time between LC diagnosis until the OE, outcomes of OE treatment, and overall survival after OE. The predominant histology was adenocarcinoma (n=59; 71.9%) and 86.8% of the patients (n=71) were in stage IV. OE was the disease presentation in 45.2% (n=37) and 6-month mortality was 75.6%. Neurologic emergencies were associated with a lower risk of 6-month mortality compared to cardiovascular and respiratory [OR 0.255 (CI 0.72-0.90), p=0.035)]. Younger patients (p=0.011), metastatic disease (p=0.02), no cancer treatment (p<0.001), and small cell carcinoma (SCLC) (p=0.016) had a shorter time between cancer diagnosis and the event. OE occurred mostly in men with metastatic adenocarcinomas. Younger patients, SCLC, metastatic disease, and no cancer treatment were associated with a shorter time between lung cancer diagnosis until the occurrence of an OE and brain metastasis with a better prognosis. There were no differences between patients admitted in 2019 and 2020 that could be related to the access to healthcare services during the SARS-COV2 pandemic."

Ileal volvulus coexisting with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease has not been reported in the literature previously. 65-year male with known history of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) presented with pain abdomen for 5 days, obstipation for 3 days, and multiple episodes of bilious vomiting in the emergency department. Being a suspect of bowel obstruction, X-ray abdomen was done which showed features of small intestine obstruction. Further, to find the etiology of obstruction, contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen was done which showed swirling of the ileal loop and the ileal mesenteric vessels along with transition point in the ileal loop suggestive of ileal volvulus. Exploratory laparotomy with detorsion of the volvulus was done for management. Small bowel volvulus, more specifically ileal volvulus, is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction. Patients present with the cardinal features of bowel obstruction, i.e., abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and constipation/obstipation. Our patient had coexisting ADPKD which further aggravated the clinical presentation. Definitive management of the volvulus includes exploratory laparotomy and detorsion along with resection of the bowel if found ischemic. In our case the bowel was healthy so only detorsion was done. Early diagnosis and meticulous exploratory laparotomy is utmost for the management of ileal volvulus. Besides, the secondary etiology (ADPKD in our case) should be managed to prevent future recurrences."

The standard of care for these patients is a laparotomy. In selected trauma patients, laparoscopy has both diagnostic and therapeutic usage. The trauma burden and the number of cases seen in a busy trauma unit make laparoscopy challenging. We wanted to describe our journey with laparoscopy in the management of abdominal trauma in a busy urban trauma unit in Johannesburg, South Africa. We reviewed all trauma patients who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) or therapeutic laparoscopy (TL) between 01 January 2017 and 31 October 2020 for blunt and penetrating abdominal trauma. The demographic data, indications for laparoscopy, injuries identified, procedures performed, intraoperative laparoscopic complications, conversion to laparotomy, morbidity, and mortality were evaluated. A total of 54 patients who had laparoscopy were included in the study. The median age was 29 years (IQR 25-25). Most injuries were penetrating 85.2% (n = 46/54) and 14.8% blunt trauma. Most patients were males, 94.4% (n = 51/54). Indications for laparoscopy included diaphragm evaluation (40.7%), pneumoperitoneum for evaluation of potential bowel injury (16.7%), free fluid with no evidence of solid organ injury (12.9%) and colostomy (5.5%). There were 8 (14.8%) cases converted to laparotomy. There were no missed injuries or mortality in the study group. Laparoscopy in selected trauma patients is safe even in a busy trauma unit. It is associated with less morbidity and shortened hospital length of stay."

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine the relationships of the trauma-specific frailty index (TSFI) and the geriatric trauma out-come score (GTOS) with 30-day mortality among geriatric trauma patients aged 65 and older. This prospective observational study included 382 patients aged 65 years and older who were admitted to a training and research hospital due to blunt trauma. Informed consent was obtained from them and/or their relatives. In addition to patients' vital signs, information about chronic diseases and drug use was obtained on admission to the emergency service and the results of labo-ratory examinations, radiological imaging, blood replacements, length of stay in the emergency room and hospital, and mortality were recorded in case forms. Glasgow coma scale, ınjury severity score, GTOS, TSFI, and body mass index (BMI) values were calculated by the researchers. Outcome information was obtained from the patient and/or relatives by phone 30 days later. When the patients who died and those who survived were compared at the 30th day after trauma, no significant difference was found in terms of BMI or TSFI (p>0.05). It was determined that patients with a GTOS of ≥95 at admission would have higher 30-day mortality (the sensitivity was 76%, and the specificity was 72.27% (p<0.001)). When correlations were evaluated according to mortality, a correlation was found between the presence of two or more comorbid diseases and mortality (p=0.001). We think that a more reliable frailty score can be obtained using these parameters as we have determined that the TSFI as calculated at admission to the emergency department is not sufficient on its own, while the lactate, GTOS, and the length of hospital stay are also effective in mortality. We suggest that it would be appropriate to use the GTOS in long-term follow-up as well as for predictive power for mortality within 24 h."

However, the introduction of seat belt legislation has led to an increase in a specific pattern of blunt trauma known as seat belt syndrome, which includes rib, clavicle, spine, and sternum fractures, as well as rupture of hollow pelvic and abdominal viscera, mesenteric tears, and major vessel injuries. The shoulder restraint part of the three-point seat belt commonly rests near or over the female and male breast. A 54-year-old female presented to our emergency department complaining of swelling and pain in her left breast immediately after a traffic accident. The patient had used a seat belt with a shoulder restraint. Bruising was noted along her chest where there had been seat belt contact. Her breast hematoma was most likely caused by breast tissue compression between her rib and the seat belt. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a sizable breast hematoma with active arterial contrast material extravasation, as well as multiple left rib fractures. The patient was conservatively treated with analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Complete resolution was achieved, and her breast returned to its normal appearance. Although endovascular treatment and surgical hemostasis have been proposed for the treatment of breast injuries with active bleeding, conservative treatment such as compression hemostasis may be feasible."

However, it has rarely been described in duodenal perforations. Our purpose is to highlight the possibility of conservative treatment in selected cases of duodenal perforation. In the period between 2009 and 2022, 6 children were treated for duodenal injury following abdominal blunt trauma in the pediatric surgical emergency department. The clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment are reported and analyzed. Three patients presented with duodenal hematomas, they were treated non-operatively with hospital stays between 12 and 20 days and good clinical outcome. One child presented with duodenal hematoma and retroperitoneal air bubbles; non-operative conservative treatment was carried with favorable results. The fifth patient had a duodenal perforation; he underwent a primary duodenal 2-layers closure. The last patient had a combination of duodenal hematoma and perforation involving 75% of the duodenal diameter for which he underwent a gastro-jejunostomy with pyloric exclusion. An isolated duodenal lesion can be subject to a conservative treatment whenever allowed by a stable clinical condition and the availability of appropriate clinical and radiological monitoring."

    "abstract": "Background: Trauma is still a major cause of mortality in people < 50 years of age. Biomarkers are needed to estimate the severity of the condition and the patient outcome. Methods: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and further laboratory markers were determined in plasma and serum of 164 patients at time of admission to the emergency room. Among them were 64 patients with severe trauma (Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16), 51 patients with moderate trauma (ISS < 16) and 49 patients with single fractures (24 femur neck and 25 ankle fractures). Disease severity was objectified by ISS and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Results: cfDNA levels in plasma and serum were significantly higher in patients with severe multiple trauma (SMT) than in those with moderate trauma (p = 0.002, p = 0.003, respectively) or with single fractures (each p < 0.001). CfDNA in plasma and serum correlated very strongly with each other (R = 0.91; p < 0.001). The AUC in ROC curves for identification of SMT patients was 0.76 and 0.74 for cfDNA in plasma and serum, respectively-this was further increased to 0.84 by the combination of cfDNA and hemoglobin. Within the group of multiple trauma patients, cfDNA levels were significantly higher in more severely injured patients and patients with severe traumatic brain injury (GCS ≤ 8 versus GCS > 8). Thirteen (20.3%) of the multiple trauma patients died during the first week after trauma. Levels of cfDNA were significantly higher in non-surviving patients than in survivors (p < 0.001), reaching an AUC of 0.81 for cfDNA in both, plasma and serum, which was further increased by the combination with hemoglobin and leukocytes. Conclusions: cfDNA is valuable for estimation of trauma severity and prognosis of trauma patients."

The goal of conservative surgery in cancer is to retain organ functions while avoiding severe excision wherever possible. In oncologic gynecological surgery, fertility-sparing surgery (FSS) is a technique that tries to preserve the uterus and ovarian tissue. A 26-year-old woman with nulligravida presented with the main complaints of pain in the right iliac fossa for 10 to 15 days and fullness in the abdomen for one month, along with a change in appetite and noticeable weight loss. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a large, well-defined, multiloculated, solid cystic mass with altered signal intensity. On exploratory laparotomy, an intraoperatively left ovarian cystic mass was seen. The ovarian mass was histopathologically diagnosed as a sex cord tumor of the ovary, with characteristics compatible with adult GCT. Disregarding the follow-up advice on discharge four months later, the patient conceived spontaneously and gave birth to a male child via emergency lower segment cesarean section. In GCTs that have not spread beyond the ovary or in people who have had relapses of the disease, FSS created the groundwork for conception and appeared safe. In the lack of any compelling supporting evidence, the line of care of terminal surgery should always be thoroughly discussed with the patient and advised for women after their families are complete."

The incidence of inferior vena cava thrombosis is extremely low and is commonly associated with outflow obstruction of the inferior vena cava. The frequency of traumatic diaphragmatic injuries is less than 1% of all traumatic injuries. In addition, it was not a typical cause of inferior vena cava obstruction. We report the case of the patient who presented with giant thrombosis of the inferior vena cava, which required surgical treatment-induced right-sided blunt traumatic diaphragmatic injury. A 60-year-old male presented to the emergency department with pelvic and lower leg pain. He was working on a dump truck with the bed raised position. Suddenly, the bed came down, and his body was crushed and injured. Primary CT showed a right lung contusion and elevation of the right diaphragm but no apparent liver injury. The right pleural effusion gradually worsened after admission, as the traumatic diaphragmatic injury was highly suspected. Repeat CT showed aggravation of elevation of the right-sided diaphragm, narrowing of the inferior hepatic vena cava due to left cephalic deviation of the liver, and formation of a giant thrombus in the inferior vena cava. No adverse hemodynamic effects were observed due to thrombus formation, and we performed thrombolytic therapy. The day after starting thrombolytic therapy, the patient developed pulmonary embolism due to a dropped in SpO2 needed oxygen, and dyspnea triggered by coughing. Thrombolytic therapy was continued after the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. However, thrombolytic therapy was ineffective, so we decided on surgical thrombectomy and inferior vena cava filter placement. The postoperative course was not eventful, and an anticoagulant was started. The patient was transferred to the hospital on the 62nd day for rehabilitation. When a diaphragmatic hernia is suspected of causing hepatic hernia and narrowing of the inferior vena cava, it may be necessary to consider emergency surgical treatment to prevent secondary inferior vena cava thrombosis and fatal pulmonary embolism."

In total, 5632 patients with blunt trauma presented to our hospital during the study period, and chest CT scan was performed for 2578 patients. Sternal fractures were diagnosed in 63 patients. The primary mechanism of injury was a motor vehicle collision. The most common site of fracture was the body of the sternum (47 patients; 74.6%). Twenty (31.7%) patients had an isolated sternal fracture with no other injuries. Seven (11.1%) patients were discharged directly from the emergency department. Two patients died (overall mortality rate, 3.2%) and two experienced long-term disability.

This study aimed to evaluate the factors that can identify patients with rib fractures with intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal injuries in the emergency department among patients with rib fracture. This retrospective observational study included adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with rib fracture on chest radiography prior to chest CT due to blunt chest trauma in the emergency department who underwent chest CT from January 2016 to February 2021. The primary outcomes were intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal injuries that could be identified on a chest CT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed.

Selection of the right approach at the right time is fundamental in the management of patients with blunt chest trauma.[1] A reliable, economic, bedside, and rapidly accomplished screening test can be pivotal. [2]. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of extended- focused assessment with sonography for trauma (E-FAST) to that of the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilisation Study (NEXUS) chest algorithm in detecting blunt chest injuries. This descriptive cross-sectional study included 50 polytrauma patients with blunt chest trauma from the emergency centre of Suez Canal University Hospital. E-FAST and computed tomography (CT) were conducted, followed by reporting of NEXUS criteria for all patients. Blinding of the E-FAST performer and CT reporter were confirmed. The results of both the NEXUS algorithm and E-FAST were compared with CT chest results. The NEXUS algorithm had 100% sensitivity and 15.3% specificity, and E-FAST had 70% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity, in the detection of pneumothorax.In the detection of hemothorax, the sensitivity and specificity of the NEXUS algorithm were 90% and 7.5%, respectively, whereas E-FAST had a lower sensitivity of 80% and a higher specificity of 97.5%. E-FAST is highly specific for the detection of hemothorax, pneumothorax, and chest injuries compared with the NEXUS chest algorithm, which demonstrated the lowest specificity. However, the NEXUS chest algorithm showed a higher sensitivity than E-FAST and hence can be used effectively to rule out thoracic injury."

    "abstract": "Bowel perforation in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection is a rarely reported complication. With the uncovering of the different treatment modalities and complications of this disease, this case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas and limitations in a special population. Clinical Presentation. A 35-year-old female, Gravida 2 Para 1 at 31 weeks age of gestation (AOG) who underwent cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status in 2019, was admitted for severe COVID-19 infection presenting with dyspnea. During her hospitalization, she developed progressive dyspnea from worsening of COVID-19 infection. Patient was eventually intubated and was given a total of two doses of tocilizumab, adequate antibiotic treatment, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. An emergency repeat cesarean section was performed due to maternal deterioration and poor variability of the fetus. She delivered to a live preterm baby girl, with an Apgar score of 1 and 7 on the 1st and 5th minute of life respectively. During the postoperative days, patient remained intubated and sedated. Increasing residuals were noted per nasogastric tube (NGT). Serial scout film of the abdomen (SFA) and medical management were performed. Upon weaning from sedation, patient complained of right lower quadrant pain. A whole abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast was requested which revealed large bowel obstruction. Patient was referred to surgery service. Upon assessment, abdomen was noted to be rigid with guarding during palpation. A scout film of the abdomen was requested and revealed extensive amount of pneumoperitoneum with scanty to absent colonic gas suggestive of bowel perforation. Patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. Upon opening the peritoneum, free air was evacuated. Approximately 1.4 liters of fecaloid peritoneal fluid was suctioned and adhesive band was noted at the pelvic area. A 2 cm full thickness perforation at the cecum with 17 cm serosal tear from the cecum to ascending colon was noted. Bowel loops proximal to the perforation were dilated. Nasogastric tube was inserted for bowel decompression. Right hemicolectomy was performed. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Acute inflammatory cells infiltrating the blood vessels and possible microthrombi and beginning thrombus formation were noted in the subserosa. Patient eventually expired on the 14th hospital day from sepsis. This case highlights a rarely reported complication of COVID-19 infection. Confluence of factors that predisposed the patient include pregnancy, COVID-19 infection, use of tocilizumab, and recent surgery. High index of suspicion is vital in the management and improvement of outcomes."

Oftentimes, it is a surgical emergency requiring exploratory laparotomy as most cases of pneumoperitoneum are due to perforated hollow viscus. However, not all pneumoperitoneum cases are surgical; nonsurgical pneumoperitoneum can arise from thoracic, abdominal, gynecologic, and other causes. We present a case of a 35-year-old male who developed a non-surgical pneumoperitoneum in the setting of drug overdose. The patient underwent robot-assisted diagnostic laparoscopy without findings of perforation or other pathology. Resolution of pneumoperitoneum was evidenced on follow-up computed tomography scan. This case emphasizes the importance of diagnostic laparoscopy in the setting of a confusing clinical picture and the feasibility of utilizing the robotic approach in hemodynamically stable patients."

We a performed laparoscopic Hartmann's operation and D2 lymphadenectomy for advanced rectal cancer. A sigmoid colostomy was created via the intraperitoneal route. On the postoperative day 12, the patient experienced abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed that the small intestine formed a closed loop in the pelvic space. The patient was diagnosed with a strangulated bowel obstruction of the small intestine for which an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. The small intestine, which had passed through a defect between the lifted sigmoid colon and the left abdominal wall, was strangulated by the lifted sigmoid colon. We performed partial resection of the small intestine. The patient died on postoperative day 32 of acute deterioration of aortic valve stenosis. There have been few reports of strangulated bowel obstruction resulting from internal hernia associated with colostomy. These findings demonstrate that it is important to select the appropriate route for colostomy creation in each case."

Here, we report a case of pacemaker lead-induced cardiac perforation rapidly diagnosed by a \"bow-and-arrow\" sign on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). A 74-year-old Chinese woman who had undergone permanent pacemaker implantation 26 d before suddenly developed severe dyspnea, chest pain, and hypotension. The patient had received emergency laparotomy for an incarcerated groin hernia and was transferred to the intensive care unit 6 d before. Computed tomography was not available due to unstable hemodynamic status, so POCUS was performed at the bedside and revealed severe pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. Subsequent pericardiocentesis yielded a large volume of bloody pericardial fluid. Further POCUS by an ultrasonographist revealed a unique \"bow-and-arrow\" sign indicating right ventricular (RV) apex perforation by the pacemaker lead, which facilitated the rapid diagnosis of lead perforation. Given the persistent drainage of pericardial bleeding, urgent off-pump open chest surgery was performed to repair the perforation. However, the patient died of shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome within 24 h post-surgery. In addition, we also performed a literature review on the sonographic features of RV apex perforation by lead. POCUS enables the early diagnosis of pacemaker lead perforation at the bedside. A step-wise ultrasonographic approach and the \"bow-and-arrow\" sign on POCUS are helpful for rapid diagnosis of lead perforation."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous perforation of the common bile duct (SPCBD) is an exceptional disease, especially in adults. The cause is often idiopathic once trauma and choledochal cyst are excluded. Early diagnosis is often difficult because of its often-misleading appearance. The authors report the case of a 54-year-old man, a known case of type 2 diabetes mellitus, who presented to our emergency department for acute abdominal pain that had evolved for 2 days. On physical examination, the patient had a fever of up to 38.5°C, and the abdomen was distended and generally tight. The abdominal computerized tomography scan confirms the presence of free fluid. In addition, the thickness of the gallbladder wall had increased in contrast with a resolved gallbladder distention. Because exploration failed to demonstrate the cause of ascites, the authors performed a diagnostic paracentesis, which revealing ascites with a dark yellow-green color, which implied bile leakage.After initial resuscitation, an emergent exploratory laparotomy was performed. The authors found biliary peritonitis secondary to SPCBD. After peritoneal lavage, the perforation was repaired over a T-tube. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histological findings were consistent with ulcerous acalculous cholecystitis. The patient was disease-free after a 3-month follow-up. SPCBD is an uncommon condition in adults, and it is rarely reported in the literature. The pathogenesis of this disease is not clear and may be related to single or multiple factors. Usually, this disease is diagnosed in the postmortem. Early diagnosis and optimal surgical treatment are challenging. This present case highlighted the preoperative diagnostic difficulties of the SPCBD. Emergent surgical management should be instituted in the shortest time possible to reduce the high mortality."

    "abstract": "Blunt trauma patients with potential cervical spine injury are traditionally immobilised in rigid collars. Recently, this has been challenged. The present study's objective was comparison of the rate of patient-oriented adverse events in stable, alert, low-risk patients with potential cervical spine injuries immobilised in rigid versus soft collars. Unblinded, prospective quasi-randomised clinical trial of neurologically intact, adult, blunt trauma patients assessed as having potential cervical spine injury. Patients were randomised to collar type. All other aspects of care were unchanged. Primary outcome was patient-reported discomfort related to neck immobilisation by collar type. Secondary outcomes included adverse neurological events, agitation and clinically important cervical spine injuries (clinical trial registration number: ACTRN12621000286842). A total of 137 patients were enrolled: 59 patients allocated to a rigid collar and 78 to a soft collar. Most injuries were from a fall <1 m (54%) or a motor vehicle crash (21.9%). Median neck pain score of collar immobilisation was lower in the soft collar group (3.0 [interquartile range 0-6.1] vs 6.0 [interquartile range 3-8.8], P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with clinician-identified agitation was lower in the soft collar group (5% vs 17%, P = 0.04). There were four clinically important cervical spine injuries (two in each group). All were treated conservatively. There were no adverse neurological events. Use of soft rather than rigid collar immobilisation for low-risk blunt trauma patients with potential cervical spine injury is significantly less painful for patients and results in less agitation. A larger study is needed to determine the safety of this approach or whether collars are required at all."

Non-traumatic, also known as spontaneous or pathological splenic rupture is an uncommon, but potentially life-threatening condition. Spontaneous splenic rupture caused by a primary splenic tumor is rare. In this case study, we present a special, benign tumor causing splenic rupture. Our 78-year-old female patient was hospitalized due to left shoulder pain and chest discomfort. Her blood pressure was low, the laboratory tests showed anemia, and the chest CT scan involving also the upper abdomen raised the suspicion of a splenic rupture. During the emergency splenectomy, there was a large amount of blood in the abdominal cavity. Macroscopic pathological examination of the removed spleen showed multifocal cystic lesions that led to splenic rupture. Immunhistochemical analyses revealed a littoral cell angioma. Littoral cell angioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor of the spleen, which is thought to originate from the red pulp sinuses lined with littoral cells. The aim of our report is to describe an unusual cause of sudden splenic rupture without traumatic history, the histologically benign littoral cell angioma that has not been published in Hungary.

While in the emergency department, the patient gradually became hypotensive with worsening tachycardia and dyspnea. A bedside echocardiogram revealed an increase in size of the pericardial effusion. An emergent ultrasound-guided pericardial drain was inserted with gradual improvement of his hemodynamics followed by placement of thoracostomy tube.

    "abstract": "Pasteurella multocida-related sepsis can cause purpura fulminans (PF), a rare thrombotic disorder that often presents acutely and is potentially fatal. As a consequence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, this hematological emergency originates from micro-thrombotic occlusion of peripheral blood vessels and resulting circulatory failure. Thus far, no studies have reported the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for saving lives in patients with worsening respiratory and circulatory failure. Moreover, the development of non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia after VA-ECMO has not yet been documented. Here, we describe the case of a 52-year-old female patient with PF and non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia due to Pasteurella multocida-related sepsis who received VA-ECMO. A 52-year-old-female patient presented to the hospital with a week-long fever and worsening cough. Chest radiography findings revealed ground-glass opacity. We made a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to sepsis and initiated ventilatory management. Because respiratory and circulatory parameters were not maintained, VA-ECMO was introduced. After admission, ischemic findings were observed in the periphery of the extremities, and a diagnosis of PF was made. Pasteurella multocida was detected in blood cultures. On day 9, the sepsis was cured with antimicrobial treatment. The patient's respiratory and circulatory status improved, and she was weaned off VA-ECMO. However, on day 16, her stable circulatory system collapsed again, and her abdominal pain worsened. We performed exploratory laparotomy and noted necrosis and perforation of the small intestine. As a result, partial resection of the small intestine was performed. In this case, VA-ECMO was used to maintain circulatory dynamics during septic shock in a patient with Pasteurella multocida infection who developed PF. Surgery was also performed for complicated ischemic necrosis of the intestinal tract, helping save the patient's life. This development illustrated the importance of paying attention to intestinal ischemia during intensive care."

Subsequent spontaneous tumor rupture can lead to massive abdominal hematoma and shock, a rare fatal gastrointestinal incident. The diagnosis of rupture is complicated, with most patients presenting with abdominal pain and shock. Prompt correction of hypovolemic shock is the primary goal of treatment. This rare case presents a 75-year-old male who presented to the emergency department because of abrupt and increasing abdominal pain after a meal. Laboratory data revealed elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alpha-fetoprotein levels. Immediate computed tomography demonstrated a defect in the right ventral abdominal wall. The patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy. Despite massive intra-abdominal adhesions, the identified source of bleeding was from the left lobe of the liver at the base of the lesser sac above the pancreas. There was a maximum effort to cease bleeding and minimize blood loss. An ensuing biopsy of the liver revealed HCC. After improving, the patient received instructions to follow up on an outpatient basis. Two months after surgery, the patient endorses no complications. The success outlined in this case highlights the essence of prompt action in an emergency, which delineates the significance of surgical experience in handling unorthodox patient presentations."

Massive pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and cardiac tamponade secondary to PICC are extremely uncommon but have potentially fatal consequences. This study investigates the incidence of tamponade, large pleural, and pericardial effusions secondary to peripherally inserted central catheters in a neonatal intensive care unit at a tertiary care center over a 10-year period. It explores possible etiologies behind such complications and suggests preventative measures. Retrospective analysis of neonates who were admitted to the NICU at the AUBMC between January 2010 and January 2020, and who required insertion of PICC. Neonates who developed tamponade, large pleural, or pericardial effusions secondary to PICC insertion were investigated. Four neonates developed significant life-threatening effusions. Urgent pericardiocentesis and chest tube placement were required in two and one patients, respectively. No fatalities were encountered. The abrupt onset of hemodynamic instability without an obvious cause in any neonate with PICC in situ should raise suspicion of pleural or pericardial effusions.

Methods  In this prospective observational study, patients with blunt trauma abdomen (BTA) who required exploration were included and divided into two groups-open exploration (open surgery [OSx]) and laparoscopic exploration (laparoscopic surgery [LSx]). Data were compiled and analyzed. Results  Out of 94 BTA patients, 66 required exploration, and the rest were managed conservatively. Out of 66 patients, 42 were in OSx and 24 were in LSx, reason for not selecting LSx was the surgeon's preference for OSx in 26 patients and the lack of availability of operation theater (OT) slots in 16 patients. LSx even after indication was less likely if patients had preoperative evidence of perforation peritonitis. Conclusion  Lack of resources (OT availability and trained personnel) are barriers to the adoption of emergency LSx in low-resource settings."

Repeat computed tomography showed expanding hematoma, and after hemodynamic decompensation, exploratory laparotomy revealed a ruptured iliac vein. Although rare, spontaneous iliac vein rupture has a high mortality rate, even when identified early. This case serves as a reminder to consider this potentially fatal diagnosis in the at-risk group and highlights the need to remain vigilant in patients who present with unexplained shock. Additionally, this case is a reminder of our duty to provide emergency care that transcends language barriers."

    "abstract": "Upper extremity vascular injuries occurring with acute compartment syndrome are very challenging to manage in an emergency context in resource-poor settings. The need to always recognize the likelihood of coexisting compartment syndrome guides surgeons to perform concomitant fasciotomy to ensure a better outcome. We managed three vascular injuries in the upper extremities in two patients with concomitant imminent compartment syndrome observed intraoperatively. The first injury was complete brachial artery disruption following blunt trauma, while the second and third injuries were radial and ulnar artery transection caused by sharp glass cuts. Both patients were treated with vascular repair and fasciotomy. Secondary wound coverage was applied with split-thickness skin grafting, and the outcomes were satisfactory. Concomitant fasciotomy potentially improves the outcomes of vascular repair in emergency vascular surgery and should be considered for all injuries with the potential for acute compartment syndrome."

He required emergency surgery including an exploratory laparotomy and thoracotomy, with splenectomy, omentectomy, and partial gastrectomy. He was subsequently transferred to our institution due to the anticipated difficulty of restoring intestinal continuity. Continuity was established with a retrocolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction with a 90 cm Roux limb. Despite significant soft-tissue necrosis, he eventually recovered and was able to be transferred back to pursue rehabilitation closer to his home in a rural community."

    "abstract": "The optimal indications and contraindications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair of retrograde Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (R-AAAD) are not well known. The goal of this study was to determine the outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair for R-AAAD at our institution and to discuss optimal indications. The medical records of 359 patients admitted to our institution for R-AAAD between December 2016 and December 2022 were reviewed, and 83 patients were finally diagnosed with R-AAAD. We selected thoracic endovascular aortic repair as an alternative, considering the anatomy of aortic dissection and the risk to patients undergoing open surgery. Nineteen patients underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair for R-AAAD. No in-hospital deaths or neurologic complications occurred. A type Ia endoleak was detected in 1 patient. All other primary entries were successfully closed. All dissection-related complications, such as cardiac tamponade, malperfusion distal to the primary entry and abdominal aortic rupture, were resolved. One patient required open conversion for intimal injury at the proximal edge of the stent graft; all other ascending false lumens were completely thrombosed and contracted at discharge. During the follow-up period, no aortic-related deaths or aortic events proximal to the stent graft occurred. The indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair were expanded to low-risk and emergency cases at our institution. The early- and midterm outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair for R-AAAD were acceptable. Further long-term follow-up is required."

    "abstract": "Pericardial effusion may occur as a result of malignant pericarditis, which may in turn result in cardiac tamponade. This paper reports on a rare case of cardiac tamponade that occurred in an African American patient with breast cancer and neurofibromatosis. Herein, we present a case of a 38-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and breast cancer. She presented with sudden shortness of breath and hypotension. Computed tomography of the chest and an echocardiogram confirmed the presence of cardiac tamponade. Symptomatic relief was obtained following an emergency pericardiocentesis. The patient experienced a recurrence of symptomatic pleuro-pericardial effusion, requiring repeat therapeutic pericardiocentesis and thoracocentesis. To eliminate accumulating fluid, an indwelling drain was placed. The clinical condition of the patient, however, continued to deteriorate and she expired a few days after admission. When patients with breast cancer present with dyspnea, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion of cardiac tamponade; urgent imaging should be performed to exclude tamponade. Further research is needed to identify the factors that predict cardiac tamponade in breast cancer patients as well as the optimal treatment for the condition. It is also necessary to examine the relationship between a history of neurofibromatosis and cardiac tamponade."

    "abstract": "Background Pretibial lacerations are common injuries that have a significant yet underestimated association with morbidity and mortality. Although they may occur in any age group, they are commonly followed by an often relatively minor trauma in elderly and frail patients. The six-month mortality among such patients may be more than double the age group average. Currently, 5.2 in 1000 patients per year present to the emergency departments in UK hospitals due to pretibial lacerations. The associated acute admissions have a high financial cost. Despite the significant disease burden, there is a paucity of evidence on the optimal management of such injuries. This study aimed to describe the typical demographic and injury factors of individuals presenting to two district general hospitals, as well as their subsequent management and referral. Methodology Relevant patients were identified through NHS coding searches. Subsequently, it was found that 99 patients presented to an NHS trust with pretibial lacerations throughout 2020. A retrospective manual evaluation of clinical documentation was performed to identify the details of the patients' injury, management, referral, and demographics. Results The patients had a mean age of 55.4 (SD 28.3), and 56.6% were female. The most commonly presenting mechanism of injury was direct blunt trauma. The majority of cases were solely managed and discharged directly by the emergency department (74.8%). Of the 99 patients, 25 (25.3%) were referred to specialist services, 12 (12.1%) were managed conservatively, and 13 (13.1%) underwent operative intervention. The mean length of stay for those referred was 5.9 days, and the mean for the same was greater for those managed conservatively compared to those managed operatively (9.0 vs. 2.6 days). Among patients discharged by the emergency department, the most common method of wound closure was steristrips (n = 40; 54.1%), followed by conservative management with dressings (n = 22; 29.7%), sutures (n = 10, 13.5%) and glue (n = 5; 6.8%). Conclusions Overall, this study showed that the majority of patients presenting with pretibial lacerations have minor wounds that can be effectively managed in the emergency department. However, those with considerably more injuries should be provided an early referral to specialist services, where they would ideally receive early surgery and comprehensive follow-up."

Currently used outcomes do not include important time-critical diagnoses and conditions. We used 18 Swedish triage experts to collect and assess outcomes for the evaluation of 5-level triage systems. The experts suggested 68 outcomes which were then tested through a modified Delphi approach in three rounds. The outcomes aimed to identify correctly prioritized red patients (in need of a resuscitation team), and orange patients (other time critical conditions). Consensus was pre-defined as 70% dichotomized (positive/negative) concordance. Diagnoses, interventions, mortality, level of care and lab results were included in the outcomes. Positive consensus was reached for 49 outcomes and negative consensus for 7 outcomes, with an 83% response rate. The five most approved outcomes were the interventions Percutaneous coronary intervention, Surgical airway and Massive transfusion together with the diagnoses Tension pneumothorax and Intracerebral hemorrhage that received specific interventions. The outcomes with the clearest disapproval included Admittance to a ward, Treatment with antihistamines and The ordering of a head computed tomography scan. The outcomes were considered valid only if occurring in or from the ED. This study proposes a standard of 49 outcomes divided into two sets tied to red and orange priority respectively, to be used when evaluating 5-level priority triage systems; Lund Outcome Set for Evaluation of Triage (LOSET). The proposed outcomes include diagnoses, interventions and laboratory results. Before widespread implementation of LOSET, prospective testing is needed, preferably at multiple sites."

    "title": "Hemodynamic management during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery: a narrative review of proper targets for safe execution and troubleshooting.",
    "abstract": "Off-pump coronary surgery requires mechanical cardiac displacement, which results in bi-ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Although transient, subsequent hemodynamic deterioration can be associated with poor prognosis and, in extreme cases, emergency conversion to on-pump surgery, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, appropriate decision-making regarding whether the surgery can be proceeded based on objective hemodynamic targets is essential before coronary arteriotomy. For adequate hemodynamic management, avoiding myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance, which includes maintaining mean arterial pressure above 70 mmHg and preventing an increase in oxygen demand beyond the patient's coronary reserve, must be prioritized. Maintaining mixed venous oxygen saturation above 60%, which reflects the lower limit of adequate global oxygen supply-demand balance, is also essential. Above all, severe mechanical cardiac displacement incurring compressive syndromes, which cannot be overcome by adjusting major determinants of cardiac output, should be avoided. An uncompromising form of cardiac constraint can be ruled out as long as the central venous pressure is not equal to or greater than the pulmonary artery diastolic (or occlusion) pressure, as this would reflect tamponade physiology. In addition, transesophageal echocardiography should be conducted to rule out mechanical cardiac displacement-induced ventricular interdependence, dyskinesia, severe mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with or without systolic motion of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, which cannot be tolerated during grafting. Finally, the ascending aorta should be carefully inspected for gas bubbles to prevent hemodynamic collapse caused by a massive gas embolism obstructing the right coronary ostium."

The authors developed a prediction model specific to prehospital trauma care and used machine learning techniques to increase its accuracy. This retrospective observational study analyzed data from patients with blunt trauma injuries due to traffic accidents and falls from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. The data were collected from the National Emergency Medical Services Information System, which stores emergency medical service activity records nationwide in the United States. A random forest algorithm was used to develop a machine learning model. The prediction model had an area under the curve of 0.95 and a negative predictive value of 0.99. The feature importance of the predictive model was highest for the AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive) scale, followed by oxygen saturation (SpO2). Among patients who were progressing to cardiac arrest, the cutoff value was 89% for SpO2 in nonalert patients. The machine learning model was highly accurate in identifying patients who did not develop cardiac arrest."

    "abstract": "Ascaris lumbricoides is a fairly common intestinal nematode affecting children worldwide, leading to major medical and surgical complications. Although most of the cases are asymptomatic, heavy infestation causes various acute abdominal complications. Ascaris-induced intestinal intussusception is one of the rare presentations. We report a case of a 13-year-old boy with Ascaris lumbricoides infestation presenting with ileocolic intussusception. The patient presented to the emergency unit with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation for two days. He was sick-looking and dehydrated. Further examination revealed diffuse abdominal distension with tenderness, guarding, and palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography showed long-segment ileocolic intussusception with several worms in the intestinal lumen and adjacent mesenteric lymphadenopathy. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, which revealed ileocolic intussusception. The telescopic loop of the ileum was found to be gangrenous and was resected, and a loop ileostomy was performed. The patient was discharged on the seventh day postoperatively without any complications. Physicians in tropical and subtropical countries should consider this condition in the differential diagnosis when they encounter similar presentations in their clinical practice. Sonography is a non-invasive, easy-to-use, and widely available imaging modality that can be employed to diagnose entrapped Ascaris in cases presenting with acute gastrointestinal complications. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention can prevent bowel ischemia/gangrene and significantly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with such cases."

However, CTs are still being overutilized especially at adult trauma centers. The aim of our study was to review our use of head CTs in adolescent blunt trauma patients. Patients aged 11-18 who underwent head CT scans from 2016 to 2019 at our urban level 1 adult trauma center were included. Data was collected via electronic medical record and analyzed through retrospective chart review. Of the 285 patients requiring a head CT, 205 had a negative head CT (NHCT) and 80 patients had a positive head CT (PHCT). There was no difference in age, gender, race, and trauma mechanism between the groups. The PHCT group was found to be with a statistically significant higher likelihood of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 15 (65% vs 23%; P < .01), abnormal head exam (70% vs 25%; P < .01), and loss of consciousness (85% vs 54%; P < .01) compared to the NHCT group. There were 44 patients who had low risk of head injury, based on the PECARN guidelines, and received a head CT. None of the patients had a positive head CT. Our study suggests that reinforcement of the PECARN guidelines should occur for ordering head CTs in adolescent blunt trauma patients. Future prospective studies are needed to validate the use of PECARN head CT guidelines in this patient population."

Our current prospective data collection is 202 consecutive blunt trauma patients from 5/13/22 to 8/18/22 receiving an eFAST and a CT/OR for comparison. Odds ratio of inaccurate eFAST increased by 5.65% for each increase of 1 kg/m3 of BMI (95% Cl 0.1%-10.8%).

The pain began in the epigastric region and right upper abdominal quadrant, then extended to the whole abdomen. Abdominal bowel sounds were decreased, with muscular defense and tenderness throughout the abdomen. On rectal touch examination, the sphincter was loose. Laboratory tests found leukocytosis and hyperglycemia. An abdominal ultrasound examination showed cholelithiasis, sludge, and little echo fluid in the lower right abdomen. The patient was diagnosed with generalized peritonitis and cholelithiasis with sepsis (qSOFA score 2; SOFA score 2). An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. We found gallbladder (GB) dilatation with fibrin surrounding the GB wall and a perforation in the border of the GB neck and cystic duct of around 10 mm in diameter. We performed cholecystectomy in the distal region of perforation. Antibiotics and analgesics were used. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 5.

We present the case of a 13-year-old male patient who presented to the hospital with an alleged history of being run over in the abdomen by a vehicle and a complaint of severe abdominal pain. Radiography of the abdomen in the standing position showed air under the diaphragm, and ultrasonography revealed free fluid in the pelvic and peritoneal cavities, clinching the diagnosis of hollow viscus perforation. The patient was resuscitated and underwent an exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia. On exploration, no perforation was found in the intraperitoneal organs. The retroperitoneum was opened, and the Cattell-Braasch maneuver was used to approach the duodenum. A single perforation was discovered in the fourth part, and a modified graham patch repair was done. As soon as the patient's bowel sounds returned, a low-fat diet was started through a nasojejunal tube placed distal to the perforation site. The patient was discharged in good condition and is doing well with regular follow-ups. This case emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion for gut perforation of both intra- and retroperitoneal organs after blunt trauma. This will help in early diagnosis and timely management to reduce perforation-associated mortality. Damage control surgery, with primary closure of the perforation, is well-suited and preferred in an emergency and resource-limited setting."

    "abstract": "Idiopathic chylopericardium is a rare disease characterized by filling of the pericardial cavity with chylous fluid and has no evident cause. Secondary chylopericardium usually results from injury or damage to the thoracic duct. The most common causes of secondary chylopericardium are trauma, thoracic or cardiac surgery, and congenital lymphangiomatosis. Conservative or surgical treatment can be pursued; however, surgical treatment is required if conservative treatment is unsuccessful. Pericardiocentesis plays a crucial role in the definitive diagnosis of chylopericardium. However, although a serious complication, its occurrence is infrequent. Non-invasive methods, such as computed tomography (CT), could be useful in predicting the color or characteristics of pericardial effusion. A 37-year-old Japanese woman presented to our hospital with a cough that persisted for 1 week. Echocardiography revealed pericardial effusion, which was diagnosed as acute pericarditis and treated with loxoprofen. However, pericardial effusion increased, and the patient presented to the emergency room with cardiac tamponade 1 month later. Pericardiocentesis was performed, which confirmed that the pericardial effusion was chylopericardium. Lymphatic scintigraphy did not show any connection between the thoracic duct and pericardial cavity, and the patient was diagnosed with idiopathic chylopericardium. The patient underwent continuous drainage for 11 days. After completion of cardiac drainage, the patient was discharged from the hospital without any exacerbation. The CT attenuation value of the pericardial fluid was 11.00 Hounsfield units (HU). Compared with the other causes of pericardial effusions encountered at our hospital, the HU on CT scan of pericardial effusion was low in our study and similar to the values on CT scan of chylous ascites reported in previous studies. Although idiopathic chylopericardium is rare, it should be considered an important cause of pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis is necessary for definitive diagnosis; however, the CT findings of pericardial effusion may help predict the presence of chylous fluid."

This study aimed to explore early recognition and timely surgical intervention. All patients with duodenal injuries treated operatively during the past 10 years were reviewed, and the data were analyzed retrospectively regarding the mechanism of injury, diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and outcome. A total of 92 patients with duodenal injuries accounted for 7.3% of 1258 patients with abdominal injury. Of the 92 patients, 71 (77.17%) experienced blunt trauma, with traffic accidents accounting for 59.2% (42/71). In 35 patients, a preoperative diagnosis was obtained by reviewing abdominal signs, peritoneocentesis, and imaging. The remaining 57 patients underwent urgent laparotomy, through which a definitive diagnosis of duodenal injury was confirmed during the operation. In all 92 patients, the surgical procedures involved simple sutures; pedicled jejunal piece coverings; and various anastomoses following resection of the injured duodenal portion, including the Whipple procedure and damage-control surgery principles. The overall mortality rate was 12.0% (11/92) with deaths mainly occurring due to associated injuries. When excluding 2 cases of intraoperative death, there were 47 cases in the double-tube gastrostomy group and 43 cases in the traditional triple-tube group, with mortality rates of 10.64% and 9.30% in the two groups, respectively (χ2 = 0.045, P > 0.05). Postoperative complications occurred in 15 patients (18.5%). There was a high incidence of duodenal (or pancreatic/biliary) leakage. Early diagnosis and operation of duodenal injury are crucial to reducing complications and mortality. Surgical methods should be based on injury grade, associated injuries, and vital signs. Double-tube gastrostomy can reduce complications such as intestinal obstruction."

We performed a secondary analysis of prospective data from 8 Level I trauma centers from 2011-2014. We compared performance of modified clinical decision instruments that (1) added eFAST as a predictor (eFAST-added clinical decision instrument), and (2) replaced CXR with eFAST (eFAST-replaced clinical decision instrument), in screening for blunt thoracic injuries. One thousand nine hundred fifty-seven patients had documented computed tomography, CXR, clinical NEXUS criteria, and adequate eFAST; 624 (31.9%) patients had blunt thoracic injuries, and 126 (6.4%) had major injuries. Compared to the NEXUS Chest clinical decision instrument, the eFAST-added clinical decision instrument demonstrated unchanged screening performance for major injury (sensitivity 0.98 [0.94 to 1.00], specificity 0.28 [0.26 to 0.30]) or any injury (sensitivity 0.97 [0.95 to 0.98], specificity 0.21 [0.19 to 0.23]).

In our secondary analysis, adding eFAST as a predictor variable did not improve the diagnostic screening performance of the original NEXUS Chest clinical decision instrument; eFAST cannot replace the CXR criterion of the NEXUS Chest clinical decision instrument."

    "abstract": "Acute traumatic aortic injuries are of the most lethal sequelae of penetrating thoracic injuries and require rapid detection and management. The American College of Radiology currently recommends the use of noncontrast CT, followed by computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the first-line imaging modalities when traumatic aortic injury is suspected. Direct signs of aortic injury on CTA include pseudoaneurysm, focal contour abnormality, intimal flap, intramural hematoma, an abrupt change in aortic caliber, and contrast extravasation. Aortic pseudoaneurysms are most often caused by blunt or penetrating trauma that results in damage to the vessel wall, turbulent blood flow, and formation of a surrounding hematoma contained by a wall of products from the clotting cascade. This wall is weaker than those of a true aneurysm and will ultimately rupture over time if not repaired. Traumatic aortic pseudoaneurysms are preferably treated by thoracic endovascular aortic repair using a prosthetic stent graft. Here, we present a 44-yearold female with a history of homelessness, polysubstance use disorder, and HIV who presented to the emergency department after being found down. She reported being shot by a pellet gun, and physical examination revealed a penetrating left-sided chest wound that appeared to be several days old. A STAT CTA was obtained and revealed a hemopneumothorax and possible thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysm. A left-sided chest tube was placed and the patient underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair through right femoral arterial access and tolerated the procedure well. The patient was placed on daily aspirin postoperatively and discharged on post-op day 5."

Thyroid Injury in a previously normal gland is rare, so is Isolated Cricoid Fracture. The expanding thyroid hematoma and an unstable larynx compound the effects of compression and lead to sudden deterioration of the patient. Case Report We report the case of young male, who sustained a blunt injury in front of the neck. He developed a swelling in the front of his neck and suddenly deteriorated, needing intubation and airway management. Computed Tomographic imaging of the neck showed thyroid hematoma and fracture of the cricoid ring requiring an emergency hemi thyroidectomy and fixation of the cricoid fracture.

    "abstract": "Background  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the alimentary tract. They are usually manifested by GI bleeding. Case Presentation  A 53-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for elective inguinal hernia repair. The patient did not have any history of GI symptoms in the past. A day after open inguinal hernia repair, the patient developed recurrent attacks of hematemesis resulting in hemodynamic instability and admission to the intensive care unit. An upper GI endoscopy identified a small bleeding gastric lesion. After multiple failed attempts to control the bleeding endoscopically, an emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. An unexpected large fungating bleeding gastric mass was detected. The mass measured approximately 40 × 30 cm, and multiple peritoneal deposits were also discovered. A wedge resection of the anterior gastric wall along with the mass was performed. Histopathology revealed a high-grade (G2) GIST. Discussion  GISTs appear in variable sizes and may lead to a variety of complications including abdominal pain, GI obstruction, and bleeding. This case highlights the unexpected presentation and sudden bleeding of a large GIST in a totally asymptomatic patient undergoing elective hernia surgery. It also illustrates that GIST can be asymptomatic and grow to large sizes before developing clinical manifestations. Conclusion  The case report highlights a common complication of GIST with unexpected timing, immediately after routine hernia surgery."

    "abstract": "Gallstone ileus is an unusual cause of small bowel obstruction, in general, let alone after cholecystectomy. It occurs in patients with chronic calculous cholecystitis and gallstones who develop a cholecystoduodenal fistula over time. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation and examination findings and is confirmed with the use of radiological modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) scan, which has been proven to be the most sensitive investigation in diagnosis. Here, we present a case of gallstone ileus that occurred 25 years after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. CT scan on admission showed adhesional small bowel obstruction given the patient's previous abdominal surgery. The patient was managed conservatively as per guidelines for the management of adhesional small bowel obstruction for 72 hours. Obstructive symptoms did not resolve despite all conservative measures, and a gastrografin challenge showed no contrast reaching the colon. Hence, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy to manage his ongoing bowel obstruction. Laparotomy revealed gallstone ileus as the cause of obstruction. This case highlights the importance of considering gallstone ileus in the differential diagnosis for patients who present to the emergency department with small bowel obstruction even years after cholecystectomy. Post-cholecystectomy gallstone ileus is very rare with very few cases reported in the literature. This condition poses diagnostic challenges both because of its rarity and because the gallbladder had been previously removed. A high index of suspicion by the surgeon is needed for diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Background The aim of this retrospective study is to establish a correlation between clinical features, surgical diagnosis, and the final diagnosis of laparotomies, as well as to establish the relationship between preoperative delay on the outcomes of surgery in the form of mortality and morbidity. Emergency surgery is high-risk in patients with acute abdomen with uncertain diagnosis. The results of surgery are remarkable and provide quick relief to the suffering and agony of patients with the dreadful condition of acute generalized peritonitis. Methodology Patients presenting with complaints of acute abdomen who needed laparotomy based on clinical judgment and investigations were included in this study. The study data were reviewed from April 2007 to January 2011 and March 2014 to February 2016 in a government hospital. Results A total of 174 patients with acute abdomen in whom there was an indication of laparotomy based on clinical judgment and radiological investigations were selected. Most patients had gastrointestinal perforation (n = 115) and acute intestinal obstruction (n = 23). The most important clinical features analyzed were abdominal tenderness (n = 160), guarding (n = 153), distention (n = 75), and tachycardia (n = 63). Conclusions Among the total patients, 150 underwent surgery within 24 hours of the presentation in the emergency and the remaining after 24 hours. The most common cause of laparotomy was a duodenal perforation in 79 patients and gastric perforation in 24 patients. A total of 114 patients developed no complications postoperatively. Among patients who developed postoperative complications, wound sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome were the most common. Mortality was noted in three patients."

    "abstract": "Pericardial tamponade (PT) early after cardiac surgery is a challenging clinical entity, not infrequently misrecognized and often only detected late in its course. Because the clinical signs of pericardial tamponade can be very unspecific, a high degree of initial suspicion is required to establish the diagnosis. In addition to clinical examination the deployment of imaging techniques is almost always mandatory in order to avoid delays in diagnosis and to initiate any necessary interventions, such as pericardiocentesis or direct cardiac surgical interventions. After a brief overview of how knowledge of PT has developed throughout history, we report on an atypical life-threatening cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgery. A 74-year-old woman was admitted for elective biological aortic valve replacement and aorto-coronary-bypass grafting (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, single vein graft to right coronary artery). On the 10th postoperative day, the patient unexpectedly deteriorated. She rapidly developed epigastric pain radiating to the left upper abdomen, and features of low peripheral perfusion and shock. There were no clear signs of pericardial tamponade either clinically or echocardiographically. Therefore, for further differential diagnosis, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan was performed under clinical suspicion of acute abdomen. Unexpectedly, active bleeding distally from the right coronary anastomosis was revealed. While the patient was prepared for operative revision, she needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which was successful. Intraoperatively, the source of bleeding was located and surgically relieved. The subsequent postoperative course was uneventful. In the first days after cardiac surgery, the occurrence of life-threatening situations, such as cardiac tamponade, must be expected. Especially if the symptoms are atypical, the entire diagnostic armamentarium must be applied to identify the origin of the complaints, which may be cardiac, but also non-cardiac. A high level of suspicion, immediate diagnostic confirmation, and rapid treatment are required to recognize and successfully treat such an emergency (Fig. 5). Pericardial tamponade should always be considered as a complication of cardiac surgery, even when symptoms are atypical. The full range of diagnostic tools must be used to identify the origin of the complaints, which may be cardiac, but also non-cardiac (Fig. 5)."

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMPs) are uncommon tumors representing an extremely rare cause of hemoperitoneum. We report a case of a 48-year-old Caucasian, premenopausal woman that presented in the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. There was no remarkable past medical and surgical history except from a known uterine leiomyoma. The ultrasound and the computed tomography imaging showed an intraperitoneal fluid collection and a heterogenous uterine mass. The patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy; a subserosal uterine tumor was identified with an actively bleeding vessel on its surface. The uterine lesion was completely excised and the histopathology set the diagnosis of a STUMP. After consultation on the significance of this finding with the patient, an abdominal total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were scheduled and performed and the subsequent histopathology detected no malignancy. This case demonstrates that a STUMP may be a rare cause of acute intraperitoneal bleeding. Careful evaluation of clinical history, imaging findings and, if needed, surgical exploration are important for the diagnosis, while appropriate follow-up is also of major importance for the management of these rare tumors. We presented an extremely rare case of hemoperitoneum due to spontaneous bleeding from a STUMP. From an oncological perspective, this case poses a diagnostic, management and follow-up challenge."

A retrospective analysis for all surgeries from 185 affiliated hospitals from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to May 2020) and as a comparison the previous year, March 2019 to May 2019 were obtained. Five surgeries were further analyzed: appendectomies, cholecystectomies, craniotomies, exploratory laparotomies, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs). Between March 2019 and May 2019, 326,726 surgeries were performed, and between March 2020 and May 2020, 237,809 surgeries were performed. The highest specialty for both years was gastroenterology. In 2020, 15.7% of the patients were admitted to the ICU versus 13.7% in 2019. For appendectomies, cholecystectomies, craniotomies, exploratory laparotomies and ERCPs, there was an increase from 2019 to 2020 in acute kidney injuries rate, infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and sepsis. All the changes in surgical volumes for the five surgeries from 2019 to 2020 were significant. For appendectomy, the statistically significant complications were infection and SIRS and sepsis. Across the board, there was a decrease in surgical volume during the COVID-19 pandemic first wave. There was a statistically significant decrease in appendectomy, cholecystectomy, exploratory laparotomy, craniotomy, and ERCP. For all five surgeries, we did see an increase in mortality rates and several complications. The only statistically significant complications were infection and SIRS and sepsis, for appendectomy."

    "abstract": "In severe blunt trauma, multiple organ injuries are often observed. Patients with a ruptured diaphragm and pericardium are referred to as having pericardio-diaphragmatic rupture. However, few studies have reported a narrowly defined case of connected rupture of the diaphragm and pericardium via their congenitally fused site along with an abdominal visceral herniation and cardiac luxation into the thoracic cavity. A 78-year-old man presented to our hospital with left chest pain caused by a traffic accident. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a left diaphragmatic rupture and an intestinal herniation into the thoracic cavity. Surgical repair of the diaphragm was performed, and pericardial rupture was noted during surgery. It was considered that the laceration had spread via the congenitally fused site of the diaphragm and pericardium. The diaphragm was sutured, but the pericardium was left open because the laceration was large and the risk of cardiac incarceration was thought to be low. One year after the operation, no recurrence of diaphragmatic hernia was observed and any circulatory symptoms were not occurred. In cases of diaphragmatic laceration extending to the fused site of the pericardium, connected pericardial rupture should also be considered. It would be challenging to detect without intraoperative findings, and it is desirable to observe both the thoracic and abdominal cavities."

    "abstract": "Introduction Animal attacks cause a considerable number of injuries and lead to morbidity and mortality among children and adults. Bull gore injuries following bullfighting and other provoked attacks have been frequently described in literature. Our study describes the pattern of injuries and the unique mechanisms and management of blunt and penetrating trauma associated with unprovoked bull attacks. Methods In this retrospective study, we collected the data of 36 patients presenting to our emergency department with a history of bullhorn injury. The data comprised age, sex, location of injury, type and description of the injury, surgical procedure performed if any, requirement of postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. The data were then compiled and analyzed with MS Excel. Results Among the 36 patients, blunt injuries constituted 58.3% of cases, whereas penetrating injuries were seen in 41.7%. Men were commonly injured with a mean age of 39.1 years. Thorax (36%) and abdomen (33%) were the common sites of injury followed by perineum (17%), head (5%), spine (6%), and extremity (2%). Fall following the impact of bull led to indirect injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhage, parietal bone fracture, cervical spine injuries, and tibial fracture. More than half of the patients (n=19, 52.8%) required some form of surgery under local or general anesthesia. Among the operated patients, seven required postoperative ICU care and two expired. Conclusion Animal attack injuries represent a less explored niche of surgical conditions. Management in the emergency department includes prompt resuscitation to achieve hemodynamic stability, thorough wound wash to remove the contaminants, and appropriate imaging, if indicated. Wound exploration is recommended for penetrating injuries and on a case-to-case basis for blunt injuries. The complications of these wounds are due to multiple wound paths, muscle tearing, evisceration of internal organs, and high risk of wound infection."

Duplications are schematically classified as spherical and tubular, respectively representing 80% and 20% of cases, with different relationships and communications with the native intestinal wall.

The patient was notable for a long history of constipation and chronic pain. Diagnostic possibilities were limited by the on-going pregnancy. Intestinal duplications are uncommon malformations, and, of these, the T-shaped subtype of the colon is among the rarest ones. In the adulthood, diagnosis is usually established in the operating room during urgent or even emergency surgery performed for abdominal complications. A duplication of the descending colon is extremely rare, and this is, to our knowledge, the only article describing a case found in advanced state of pregnancy."

At the exploration of peritoneal cavity, unexpectedly, a live tapeworm was found in the peritoneal cavity. The perforation was repaired and medication were continued by anthelmintic. He was discharged with good condition. We discuss this rare incidental finding in a patient with bowel perforation and suggest the taeniasis as a possible cause of intestinal perforation. The medical literature and reviews have been searched to find more information about taeniasis and its cause-effect in GI tract complications.

Giant inguinoscrotal hernias are rare in developed countries because of their better medical resources and early treatment. However, they can develop in patients who refuse surgery or ignore their condition. Intervention is inevitable because strangulation and organ perforation can occur, leading to peritonitis and sepsis. Common surgical approaches include open abdominal and inguinal approaches or a combination of both. We present the case of a 73-year-old man who visited our emergency department with a huge mass in his left scrotum and septic complications. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a large left inguinoscrotal hernia that contained small bowel loops and the colon. Emergency surgical intervention was performed immediately because intestinal strangulation was highly suspected. The operative repair was performed using a combination of mini-exploratory laparotomy and the inguinal approach. The incarcerated organs, which included the ileum and sigmoid colon, had relatively good intestinal perfusion without perforation or ischemic changes. They were successfully reduced into the abdomen, and bowel resection was not necessary. A tension-free prosthetic mesh was used for the hernia repair. Two weeks after the initial surgery, and with adequate antimicrobial therapy, the patient recovered and was discharged from our hospital. No evidence of hernia relapse was noted during the outpatient follow-up examination 3 mo after surgery.

    "abstract": "Large pericardial effusion (LPE) and tamponade are purported manifestations associated with atypical chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD); however, their temporal association with GVHD, management, and impact on overall outcome are not well established. We report a retrospective analysis of 38 patients who developed LPE from a cohort of 1265 (3.00%) patients age ≥18 years who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) at Mayo Clinic between March 1993 and August 2020. The median patient age at the time of LPE was 54 years (interquartile range [IQR], 44 to 58 years), and 8 of the 38 patients (21%) had previous cardiomyopathy. The median time from alloHCT to detection of LPE was 197 days (IQR, 40 to 378 days). Overall, the incidence of grade II (15 of 38; 40%) and grade III-IV (9 of 38; 24%) acute GVHD (aGVHD) was higher in patients who developed LPE compared with those who did not develop LPE (P = .005). The incidence rates of moderate (10 of 38; 26%) and severe (15 of 38; 40%) cGVHD according to the 2014 National Institutes of Health cGVHD criteria were also higher in the LPE cohort (P = .03). Twenty-nine patients (76%) presented with cardiac tamponade, 32 patients (84%) underwent urgent pericardiocentesis for symptomatic LPE, and 2 patients had a pericardial window placement. Four patients were medically managed with colchicine, steroids, diuresis, and immunosuppressive therapy (IST). On multivariable analysis, HCT Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) group (hazard ratio [HR] 3.57; [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29 to 9.85; P = .014] for HCT-CI 1 to 2; 4.06 [95% CI, 1.50 to 10.99; P = .006] for HCT-CI ≥3) and aGVHD (HR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.11 to 5.12; P = .026] for grade II and 2.82 [95% CI, 1.07 to 7.44; P = .038] for grade III-IV) were significant risk factors for developing LPE. At a median follow-up of 40 months post-alloHCT, median disease-free survival (DFS) was 34.2 months (95% CI, 25.3 to 45.7 months) in patients who did not develop LPE and 32.2 months (95% CI, 13.2 to undefined upper limit) in those who developed LPE (P = .41). The median overall survival (OS) post-alloHCT was 50.9 months (95% CI, 41.8 to 64.8 months) in patients who did not develop LPE and was 32.9 months (95% CI, 19.5 to undefined upper limit) in patients who developed LPE (P = .003). In summary, LPE and tamponade can present at various time points post-alloHCT, and management includes pericardiocentesis, steroids, and intensification/initiation of IST if associated with serositis. LPE does not appear to result in permanent cardiac damage but results in inferior OS."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) refers to injuries without wounds entering the peritoneal cavity due to road traffic accidents (RTA) and falls, as a result of collision or counter collision. The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency of patients with visceral injuries in blunt abdominal trauma. This study was carried out in the Department of Surgery, including ward-3 of Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre, Karachi, from November 2017 till November 2020. The study design was descriptive case series. During the study period, the data of 112 patients was collected, which comprised of 102 males and 10 females. All the patients between 12 to 65 years of age (mean age:31.84±13.14 years) presenting to the emergency with < 24 hours of abdominal trauma, were included in the study. Organs involved during blunt abdominal trauma were observed and frequency was recorded. Liver injuries were found in 48(42.28%) patients, intestinal injuries in 40(35.7%), splenic injuries in 32(28.5%), kidney injuries in 24(21.4%), pancreatic injuries in 8(7.1%) and stomach injuries in 4(3.5%) patients. Grade 4 liver injury was found in 80(71%) patients, Grade 2 and 3 splenic injuries in 56(50%) patients whereas 47(42%) patients had grade 1 kidney injury. Liver was found to be the most frequent organ involved, followed by intestine and spleen."

    "abstract": "Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh is an orthopedic emergency. Compartment syndrome of the thigh without a fracture or any other associated pre-injury pathology is scantily reported in the literature. Lack of awareness and inexperience often results in a failure to diagnose it. In this article, we are presenting a rare case of acute compartment syndrome involving the anterior compartment of the thigh without any bony abnormality or a fracture in a 62-year-old male who sustained an injury to his lateral aspect of the right thigh by a fall from a height. We performed an emergency fasciotomy and decompression of the involved compartment. The patient needed a subsequent skin grafting for the wound closure. Finally, after 7 months of follow-up, an excellent clinical outcome of the affected limb has been achieved decompression of the involved compartment. The patient needed a subsequent skin grafting for the wound closure. Finally, after 7 months of follow-up, an excellent clinical outcome of the affected limb has been achieved. Thigh compartment syndrome without a fracture or other pre-injury pathological abnormalities of the thigh is relatively rare, hence there is often a fair risk that a case will go unnoticed. Therefore, a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt treatment can protect a patient with thigh compartment syndrome from long-term disability."

    "abstract": "There are conflicting data regarding the accuracy of thoracic point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in detecting traumatic pneumothorax (PTX). The purpose of our study was to determine the accuracy of thoracic POCUS performed by emergency physicians for the detection of clinically significant PTX in blunt and penetrating trauma patients. We conducted a retrospective institutional review board-approved study of trauma patients 15 years or older presenting to our urban Level I academic trauma center from December 2021 to June 2022. All study patients were imaged with single-view chest radiography (CXR) and thoracic POCUS. The presence or absence of PTX was determined by multidetector computed tomography (CT) or CXR and ultrasound (US) with tube thoracostomy placement. A total of 846 patients were included, with 803 (95%) sustaining blunt trauma. POCUS identified 13/15 clinically significant PTXs (defined as ≥35 mm of pleural separation on a blinded overread or placement of a tube thoracostomy prior to CT) with a sensitivity of 87% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58-97), specificity of 100% (95% CI 99-100), positive predictive value of 81% (95% CI 54%-95%), and negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI 99%-100%). The positive likelihood ratio was 484 and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.1. CXR identified eight (53%) clinically significant PTXs, with a sensitivity of 53% (95% CI 27%-78%) and a specificity of 100%, when correlated with the CT. The most common reason for a missed PTX identified on expert-blinded overread was failure to recognize a lung point sign that was present on US. Thoracic POCUS accurately identifies the majority of clinically significant PTXs in both blunt and penetrating trauma patients. Common themes for false-negative thoracic US in the expert-blinded overread process identified key gaps in training to inspire US education and medical education research."

    "abstract": "Nosocomial pneumonia has poor prognosis in hospitalized trauma patients. Croce et al. published a model to predict post-traumatic ventilator-associated pneumonia, which achieved high discrimination and reasonable sensitivity. We aimed to externally validate Croce's model to predict nosocomial pneumonia in patients admitted to a Dutch level-1 trauma center. This retrospective study included all trauma patients (≥ 16y) admitted for > 24 h to our level-1 trauma center in 2017. Exclusion criteria were pneumonia or antibiotic treatment upon hospital admission, treatment elsewhere > 24 h, or death < 48 h. Croce's model used eight clinical variables-on trauma severity and treatment, available in the emergency department-to predict nosocomial pneumonia risk. The model's predictive performance was assessed through discrimination and calibration before and after re-estimating the model's coefficients. In sensitivity analysis, the model was updated using Ridge regression. 809 Patients were included (median age 51y, 67% male, 97% blunt trauma), of whom 86 (11%) developed nosocomial pneumonia. Pneumonia patients were older, more severely injured, and underwent more emergent interventions. Croce's model showed good discrimination (AUC 0.83, 95% CI 0.79-0.87), yet predicted probabilities were too low (mean predicted risk 6.4%), and calibration was suboptimal (calibration slope 0.63). After full model recalibration, discrimination (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.80-0.88) and calibration improved. Adding age to the model increased the AUC to 0.87 (95% CI 0.84-0.91). Prediction parameters were similar after the models were updated using Ridge regression. The externally validated and intercept-recalibrated models show good discrimination and have the potential to predict nosocomial pneumonia. At this time, clinicians could apply these models to identify high-risk patients, increase patient monitoring, and initiate preventative measures. Recalibration of Croce's model improved the predictive performance (discrimination and calibration). The recalibrated model provides a further basis for nosocomial pneumonia prediction in level-1 trauma patients. Several models are accessible via an online tool.

    "abstract": "A 60-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room for a 7-day history of abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and lack of flatus. She had been diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (SSc) 10 years ago and had been using methotrexate, sildenafil, and prednisone. She did not present any signs of instability, but physical examination showed malnourishment status and abdominal tenderness and distention. Plain abdominal radiography was suggestive of sigmoid volvulus, confirmed and successfully resolved after endoscopic decompression therapy. Eight months later, the patient developed a new episode of abdominal obstruction. Computed Tomography (CT) scan identified a distended sigmoid colon due to its torsion with gas areas within the bowel wall. This time, endoscopic decompression had failed to treat, so exploratory laparotomy was performed. Colonic distention and sigmoid volvulus were identified during the procedure, after which sigmoidectomy followed by primary anastomosis was performed. Neither perforation nor masses were found. Furthermore, the anatomopathological study was inconsistent with vascular, inflammatory, or neoplastic diseases."

Secondary objectives were to evaluate for associations between trauma type, injury severity, and the diagnostics and interventions selected by primary clinicians. Retrospective evaluation of veterinary trauma registry data. Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) veterinary trauma centers (VTCs). A total of 3895 feline trauma patients entered in the VetCOT trauma registry from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019. Data collected included patient demographics, trauma type, Abdominal Fluid Score (AFS), Animal Trauma Triage (ATT) score, surgical intervention, glide sign on Thoracic Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma, Triage, and Tracking (TFAST), pleural effusion on TFAST, modified Glasgow Coma Scale (mGCS), and outcome (survival to discharge). Data from 3895 cats were collected over a 30-month period. Incidence of trauma types was as follows: blunt, 58% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56%-59%); penetrating, 35% (95% CI: 34%-37%); and combination, 7.4% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). Differences in survival incidence among the trauma types were identified: blunt, 80% (95% CI: 78%-81%); penetrating, 90% (95% CI: 89%-92%); and combined, 68% (95% CI: 63%-74%) (P < 0.01). Cats in the penetrating trauma group had the lowest proportion of severe injuries (6%) and highest proportion of mGCS of 18 (89%); cats with combined trauma had the highest proportion of severe injuries (26%) and lowest proportion of mGCS of 18 (63%). Point-of-care ultrasound and surgery were not performed in the majority of cases. When surgery was performed, the majority of blunt cases' procedures occurred in the operating room (79%), and the majority of penetrating cases' procedures were performed in the emergency room (81%). Cats suffering from penetrating trauma had the best outcome (survival), lower ATT scores, and higher mGCS overall. Cats that sustained a component of blunt trauma had a lower survival rate, higher ATT scores, and the highest proportion of mGCS <18."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The purpose of this study is to discuss a patient with a history of conditions, including arthrogryposis, gastroschisis, and malignant hyperthermia, who presented with cecal volvulus requiring urgent surgical intervention. CASE REPORT A 29-year-old woman with a history of arthrogryposis, gastroschisis, malignant hyperthermia, and multiple childhood abdominal surgeries presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with 2 days of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. A CT abdomen/pelvis revealed findings concerning for a cecal volvulus. The patient was premedicated and monitored closely by the anesthesia team due to her history of malignant hyperthermia. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, where a dilated cecum and proximal ascending colon were found to be completely volvulized around the mesentery. Manual bowel detorsion was performed, which resulted in reperfusion of the ischemic-appearing bowel, which then appeared viable. She recovered well after the procedure and was discharged on postoperative day 5. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights a patient who presented with a combination of 4 findings: arthrogryposis, gastroschisis, malignant hyperthermia, and cecal volvulus. With arthrogryposis reported to be associated with gastroschisis and malignant hyperthermia, this report not only corroborates this association, but also aims to draw attention to the fact that these conditions have potential to occur jointly with cecal volvulus. Given the patient's history of gastroschisis requiring extensive abdominal surgeries that contribute as risk factors for cecal volvulus, it is possible there may be other arthrogryposis patients who present with cecal volvulus similar to that seen in this patient."

    "abstract": "Blunt bowel injury (BBI) is relatively rare but life-threatening when delayed in surgical repair or anastomosis. Providing enteral nutrition (EN) in BBI patients with open abdomen after damage control surgery is challenging, especially for those with discontinuity of the bowel. Here, we report a 47-year-old male driver who was involved in a motor vehicle collision and developed ascites on post-trauma day 3. Emergency exploratory laparotomy at a local hospital revealed a complete rupture of the jejunum and then primary anastomosis was performed. Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to our trauma center for septic shock and hyperbilirubinemia. Following salvage resuscitation, damage control laparotomy with open abdomen was performed for abdominal sepsis, and a temporary double enterostomy (TDE) was created where the anastomosis was ruptured. Given the TDE and high risk of malnutrition, multiple portions EN were performed, including a proximal portion EN support through a nasogastric tube and a distal portion EN via a jejunal feeding tube. Besides, chyme delivered from the proximal portion of TDE was injected into the distal portion of TDE via a jejunal feeding tube. Hyperbilirubinemia was alleviated with the increase in chyme reinfusion. After 6 months of home EN and chyme reinfusion, the patient finally underwent TDE reversal and abdominal wall reconstruction and was discharged with a regular diet. For BBI patients with postoperative hyperbilirubinemia who underwent open abdomen, the combination of multiple portions EN and chyme reinfusion may be a feasible and safe option."

    "abstract": "Abdominal CT scan using oral and intravenous (IV) contrast is helpful in the diagnosis of intra-abdominal injuries. However, the use of oral and IV contrast delays the process of diagnosis and increases the risk of aspiration. It has also been shown that CT scan with IV contrast alone is as helpful as CT scan with oral and IV contrast and rectal CT scan in detecting abdominal injuries. Therefore, the present study aims to prospectively compare the diagnostic value of CT scan with oral and IV contrast versus CT scan with IV contrast alone in the diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). Altogether 123 BAT patients, 60 (48.8%) women and 63 (51.2%) men with the mean age of (40.4 ± 18.7) years who referred to the emergency department of Imam Khomeini Educational and Medical Center in Sari, Iran (a tertiary trauma center in north of Iran) from November 2014 to March 2017 and underwent abdominal CT scans + laparotomy were investigated. Those with penetrating trauma or hemodynamically unstable patients were excluded. The participants were randomly allocated to two groups: abdominal CT scan with oral and IV contrast (n = 63) and CT scan with IV contrast alone (n = 60). No statistically significant difference was found between two groups regarding the hemodynamic parameters, age, gender, injury mechanisms (all p > 0.05). The results of CT scan were compared with that of laparotomy results. The collected data were recorded in SPSS version 22.0 for Windows. Quantitative data were presented as mean and SD. The sensitivity and specificity of CT scan using oral and IV contrast in the diagnosis of BAT were estimated at 96.48 (95% CI: 90.73 - 99.92) and 92.67 (95% CI: 89.65 - 94.88), respectively; while CT scan with IV contrast alone achieved a comparable sensitivity and specificity of 96.6 (95% CI: 87.45 - 99,42 and 92.84 (95% CI: 89.88 - 95.00), respectively. CT scan with IV contrast alone can be used to assess visceral injuries in BAT patients with normal hemodynamics to avoid diagnostic delay."

We present a case of a 74-year-old woman on warfarin who presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Her abdomen was distended with generalized tenderness and palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). After admission and imaging, exploratory laparotomy showed hemorrhagic cholecystitis with CCF in the cecum. There was no pus or stool contamination. A cholecystectomy followed by right hemicolectomy with primary ileocolic anastomosis was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged in stable condition. The presence of hemorrhagic cholecystitis in conjunction with CCF could lead to significant consequences such as hemorrhagic and septic shock in older patients with comorbidities. It is crucial to identify and intervene early before clinical deterioration."

    "abstract": "Subacute cardiac tamponade is a diagnostic challenge for clinicians because the symptoms would be non-specific upon presentation. The onset of cardiac tamponade may vary depending on the rate of accumulation and compensatory mechanism of the fibroelastic pericardial sac. In the case of subacute tamponade with effusion without cardiac arrest, it is usually challenging for the clinician to make the decision for urgent drainage. Usually, cardiac tamponade is treated as a medical emergency, and it occurs when fluid accumulated in the pericardial sac compresses the heart causing haemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest. In our case, a 40-year-old man presented with a seven-day history of significant shortness of breath. He presented to the emergency department and the chest X-ray showed a large cardiac silhouette, which suggested a large pericardial effusion. ECG revealed minor changes in the heights of QRS complexes. Point-of-care echocardiography showed a large pericardial effusion, and he was immediately admitted to the cardiac unit. Urgent departmental echocardiography confirmed massive pericardial effusion with features of subacute tamponade. The patient was sent to the cardiac catheterisation lab and a total of approximately 4.2 litres of pericardial effusion was drained, while he was closely monitored for the risk of rapid physiologic decompensation after drainage. Pericardial fluid culture did not show any evidence of microorganism growth. The connective tissue disease screen was negative. CT scan did not show any stigmata of occult malignancy or features of infection. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) polymerase chain reaction test was negative. He had rapid symptomatic improvement after the effusion was drained and recovery was uneventful. He was discharged from the hospital with a follow-up plan. We concluded that it was a case of subacute cardiac tamponade due to a massive pericardial effusion of idiopathic or subclinical viral causes. Clinical presentation of subacute cardiac tamponade could be easily missed, and a detailed assessment of the effusion with echocardiography was very helpful in making decisions for the management."

    "abstract": "There are numerous emergency department visits in the United States for all types of marine animal injuries each year. These injuries may result in significant morbidity or mortality if not managed appropriately. Accurate identification of the offending species, thorough wound hygiene, and judicious use of antibiotics are important for preventing infections. This review aims to describe management strategies and antimicrobial considerations for nonmammalian marine vertebrate penetrating trauma in North America, the Caribbean, and Hawaii. A literature search was performed to identify studies on this subject. This literature consisted of clinical case reports and case series. Reports extracted included those on sharks, barracuda, eels, catfish, stingrays, lionfish, stonefish, and scorpionfish. The majority of reported trauma occurred to beachgoers, fishermen, or commercial aquarium employees who routinely handle these animals. Injury patterns depended on the species but most commonly affected the lower extremities. Infections were seen from saltwater bacteria, human skin flora, or marine animal oral flora. After thorough wound irrigation and exploration, most authors recommended prophylactic antimicrobials to cover Vibrio species, in addition to other gram-negative and gram-positive species. The literature is notable for the lack of controlled studies. Some authors recommended radiographic and/or ultrasonographic imaging to identify retained foreign bodies, such as spines, sand, or teeth."

    "abstract": "A 66 years old male was admitted to our hospital after a serious car accident. The patient presented with severe shock after admission. After the examination, the patient was diagnosed with hemopneumothorax and myocardial contusion, accompanied by spleen rupture. After emergency surgery and a series of symptomatic treatments, the patient's condition gradually stabilized. One week later, the patient suddenly presented with severe shock. Massive hemothorax was found on the left side of the chest. Surgical exploration revealed cardiac rupture and accidental absence of congenital pericardium. According to the literature review, congenital absence of pericardium (CAP) is relatively rare. Although there are certain imaging features, the clinical diagnosis is very difficult. However, this patient did not show the characteristics in the literature and had some other atypical features. The role of CAP in the occurrence and development of the patient's heart injury and rupture is worthy of discussion. What we learned from this case is that we should look for potential risks in the telltale signs of a patient's condition."

In contrast to idiopathic intussusception frequently occurring in children, adult intussusception is fairly uncommon and usually indicates a malignancy. We presented an 84-year-old man with small bowel intussusception and obstruction due to a solitary metachronous metastasis from RCC. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast revealed small bowel obstruction and a 4 × 4 cm intraluminal soft-tissue mass with moderate enhancement. During urgent exploratory laparotomy, a pedunculated tumor of the distal ileum was found to be the lead point of intussusception. Hence, reduction of the intestinal invagination and segmental resection of the ileum with functional end-to-end anastomosis were performed. Histological examination finally confirmed the diagnosis. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient was discharged without any complications on postoperative day 6. The case report highlights the rarity of solitary metachronous small bowel metastases from RCC and suggests that life-long follow-up of RCC patients is critical due to its unpredictable behavior and the possibility of a long period of dormancy. Complete surgical resection remains the mainstay treatment for such patients."

In this study, we aim to describe the rate of acute hemostasis and thromboembolic complications with andexanet for refractory pericardial bleeding during AF ablation. In this multicenter, case series, participating centers identified patients who received a dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban within 24 h of AF ablation, developed refractory pericardial bleeding during the procedure despite pericardiocentesis and administration of protamine and received andexanet. Eleven patients met inclusion criteria, with mean age of 73.5 ± 5.3 years and median CHA2 DS2 -VASc score 4 [3-5]. All patients received protamine and pericardiocentesis, and 9 (82%) received blood products. All patients received a bolus of andexanet followed, in all but one, by a 2-h infusion. Acute hemostasis was achieved in eight patients (73%) while three required emergent surgery. One patient (9%) experienced acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction after receiving andexanet. Therapeutic AC was restarted after a mean of 2.2 ± 1.9 days and oral AC was restarted after a mean of 2.9 ± 1.6 days, with no recurrent bleeding. In patients on uninterrupted apixaban or rivaroxaban, who develop refractory pericardial bleeding during AF ablation, andexanet can achieve hemostasis thereby avoiding the need for emergent surgery. However, there is a risk of thromboembolism following administration."

Previous studies have used serum albumin to assess postoperative morbidity, mortality, and various other surgical outcomes in cardiac surgeries and elective gastrointestinal surgeries. In this study, we used preoperative serum albumin levels to assess postoperative surgical site wound complications in patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. Methodology Preoperative serum albumin level was observed in 60 patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy due to various pathological conditions and were divided into those with hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin level <3.5 g/dl and >3.5 g/dL). Postoperative surgical site infections, wound dehiscence, and various complications, such as duration of hospital stay, prolonged ileus, the incidence of enterocutaneous fistula, the incidence of anastomotic leak, and 30-day mortality, were assessed. Results In our study, about 65% of the patients had hypoalbuminemia. Among them, 56.4% of the patients had surgical site infections according to the Southampton grade, with a statistically significant p-value of <0.001. Moreover, 87.2% of the patients had wound dehiscence according to the World Union Wound Healing Societies Surgical Wound Dehiscence wound grading, with a statistically significant p-value of <0.001. In addition, statistical significance was noted between preoperative hypoalbuminemia and increased postoperative hospital stay, with a p-value of <0.001. Conclusions Preoperative serum albumin value is a formidable predictor of postoperative surgical site infections, wound dehiscence, and duration of hospital stay in patients who underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy."

Methods: Retrospective single-center case series study, 41 patients with precordial wounds hospitalized at the Institute of Emergency Medicine, Chisinau, period 2005-2020. Mean age - 45.8 Ã+- 8.9 years, M:F/19.5:1. Traumatic event: stabbing (82.9%,n=34) or gunshot wound (17.1%,n=7). Preoperative paraclinical examinations: electrocardiography, chest X-ray, FAST, pleurotomy, pericardial puncture, and thoracoscopy. Results: 36 (87.8%) patients were hemodynamically unstable on hospitalization, and 19 (52.8%) were immediately transferred to the operating room. Preferred surgical access: left anterolateral thoracotomy - 26 (63.4%), right anterolateral thoracotomy - 13 (31.7%), and left posterolateral thoracotomy - 2 (4.9%). Non-penetrating lesions were discovered in 5 (12.2%) while penetrating trauma in other 36 (87.8%) cases, most frequently the right ventricle being injured.

The patient presented with extensive emphysema and severe respiratory distress with bilateral tension pneumothorax. Endotracheal intubation and two thoracostomy tubes were applied. Pneumothorax and a massive air leak persisted on the right side. After thoracotomy, right main bronchus avulsion was present and then repaired by end-to-end anastomosis and muscle flap. minimal air leaks from right chest tubes and partially expanding right lung on chest X-ray are seen after that. So, reinforcement by biliary (instead of bronchial) stent was performed because unavailability of bronchial stent with the desired size at that time. Traumatic tracheobronchial damage occurs in just 0.05-3% of all pediatric thoracic traumas. It's fatal condition especially in first hour. With proper recognition and management of these injuries, there is an associated improved long-term outcome. This article reviews the current literature and discusses the initial evaluation, current management practices, and future directions in pediatric thoracic trauma. Biliary stent placement could be a reasonable treatment option for tracheobronchial damage."

    "title": "Pediatric sigmoid colonic perforation with Campylobacter enterocolitis: a case report and review of the literature.",
    "abstract": "Campylobacter-related infectious gastroenteritis is common and usually self-limited. Intestinal perforation is a rare complication of the infectious colitis caused by Campylobacter, and only handful of cases have been reported. This is the first published case report of pediatric Campylobacter intestinal perforation located in the sigmoid colon. A 15-year-old previously Taiwanese healthy boy presented with 5 days of fever up to 39.8 °C, with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. Although he received antimotility agents and antipyretics at a local clinic to relieve symptoms, he came to the emergency department with signs of shock manifesting as hypothermia to 35.2 °C, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. Laboratory testing demonstrated leukocytosis with left shift and significant elevation of C-reactive protein. Stool and blood cultures were obtained, and he was admitted for fluid challenge and antibiotic treatment. On the second day of admission, he suffered from sudden onset of severe, diffuse abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed muscle guarding, rebounding tenderness, and silent bowel sound. Abdominal X-ray showed subdiaphragmatic free air at standing view. The patient underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed sigmoid colon perforation about 0.5 cm. Enterolysis and repair of sigmoid colon were performed. Intraoperative stool specimen nucleic acid amplification testing had turned positive for Campylobacter spp. with negative results for other bacterial pathogens. His symptoms improved and he tolerated food well, and was discharged 15 days after admission. We present this case because of the rarity of Campylobacter-induced sigmoid colon perforation in the pediatric population. It is important to keep in mind that sigmoid colon perforation can be due to an infectious cause, and one of the culprits can be Campylobacter. Infectious colitis caused by Campylobacter spp. should be managed cautiously and the use of antimotility agents in such conditions should be considered judiciously."

    "abstract": "We present the case of an adult man with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, who initially presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and distension, but was diagnosed with cardiac tamponade on CT after distended neck veins and tachycardia were identified on examination. He had emergency pericardial drainage to relieve the haemopericardium and was treated with colchicine. He was further found to be deficient in factors II, VII and X despite not being on warfarin, and was therefore supplemented with vitamin K. This confirms a diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency, likely multifactorial from malabsorption due to chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, small bowel obstruction and possibly exacerbated by subsequent ciprofloxacin use for small intestine bacterial overgrowth. This is the first report of spontaneous haemopericardium secondary to vitamin K deficiency in an adult patient not on anticoagulation, and is an important learning point due to the life-threatening progression of the haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade."

    "abstract": "A teenage female patient visited the ophthalmology emergency department reporting blunt ocular trauma from a stretched elastic band, accompanied by blurred vision. At presentation, uncorrected visual acuity (VA) was 6/60 in the affected eye, improving to 6/7.5 with pinhole. A slit lamp examination showed a mild anterior chamber reaction and iridoplegia with pupil shape irregularity. Gonioscopy revealed partial cyclodialysis with angle recession. Fundoscopy revealed focal commotio retinae with blot hemorrhages. B-scan ultrasonography yielded no pathology. Follow-up examination, the day after the injury, included detailed refraction, which showed a myopic shift in the affected eye. Uncorrected VA improved to 6/15 and the patient achieved 6/7.5 with correction. Clinical findings indicated myopia, which resolved within one week from the incident, and refractive error rapidly decreased to prior emmetropic values."

    "title": "Splenic injury during colonoscopy: modern treatment approach and splenic salvage.",
    "abstract": "Splenic injury is a rare complication of colonoscopy, estimated to occur in 0.020 to 0.034% of procedures, with a 30-day mortality of 3.6% (1-3). Of the three major severe adverse events during colonoscopy (perforation, bleeding, and splenic injury), splenic injury has the highest mortality but is rarest (1). The spleen is attached to the colonic splenic flexure by the splenocolic ligament, suggesting that manipulation of the colon during colonoscopy may cause direct tension or impaction on the spleen and splenic hilum as the mechanism of injury (2,3). Patients typically present within 24 hours of colonoscopy with severe abdominal pain and peritonism, and may be haemodynamically unstable (2). The majority of published cases of high-grade splenic injury due to colonoscopy have been managed with splenectomy (2,3), however smaller numbers have been managed with embolization and conservative measures (3). Modern treatment options for splenic injury due to colonoscopy can be classified into con- servative, endovascular, and surgical management (3). Conservative management involves inpatient moni- toring, with analgesia, intravenous fluids, and blood transfusion (2,3). Endovascular treatment is splenic artery embolization, typically with deployment of coils into the splenic artery proximal to the splenic hilum or into a single splenic artery branch in cases with an isolated focal injury (2-4). Surgical management is principally laparotomic splenectomy (2,3). In modern treatment protocols, splenectomy is usually reserved for unstable patients who require emergent laparotomy (4). Given the similarity in mechanism between splenic injuries due to blunt trauma and those due to colonoscopy, it may be helpful to conceptualize splenic injuries due to colonoscopy according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grading system (5). After institutional ethical approval, electronic medical records over a 10-year period (2012-2022) were searched to identify all patients treated for splenic injury due to colonoscopy, with the following inclusion criteria: • Splenic laceration diagnosed on computed tomography (CT). Colonoscopy within 72 hours of CT diagnosis. • Absence of blunt external traumatic incident between colonoscopy and diagnosis. Patient demographic information, past surgical history, colonoscopy indication, splenic injury grading, treatment and outcome data were analysed. Two males and 3 females were included, with median age of 63 years (range: 40-72), and four had undergone previous abdominal surgery (Table 1) (Figure 1). AAST injury grades were II to V. One patient with an AAST II injury was treated conservatively without requiring embolization or splenectomy. Three patients with AAST III-V injuries were treated primarily with splenic artery embolization, with one patient undergoing splenectomy 2 weeks later due to increased haematoma on CT. One patient with AAST III injury was treated conservatively but then underwent splenectomy 6 days later due to clinical rebleeding. All patients in the cohort survived, and 3 of 5 achieved splenic salvage. The spleen has important immune and non-immune functions, as the main filter of blood-borne pathogens, antigens, and red blood cells and patients post- splenectomy have increased life-long risk of infection(6). Embolization preserves splenic function via collateral arterial supply and splenectomy may therefore be best reserved for patients who require emergent laparotomy or where conservative and endovascular management have failed. In the present cohort, 3 of 5 patients were able to avoid splenectomy, higher than in previous published reports (47-69% splenectomy rate) (2,3). The higher splenectomy and mortality rates in previous reports may be due to publication bias favouring severe cases. As a rare complication of colonoscopy, splenic injury requires prompt diagnosis and management to minimize mortality. All patients in the present cohort survived, 3 of 5 with splenic salvage. A treatment protocol utilizing conservative management for low-grade injuries and embolization for high-grade injuries may optimise rates of splenic salvage with long-term public health benefits. This paper has not been presented previously at a conference and is not under consideration by any other journal for publication. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

    "abstract": "Traumatic penetrating injuries to the back are uncommon in children. This type of injury presents many considerations for airway management to the anesthesiologist, including having to secure the airway in a prone position. Although there have been several reports about intubation in the prone position for adult patients in emergency conditions, such studies on pediatric patients are rare. We present the case of a male child with an impaled steel shaft connected to a toy car wheel in his lower back, requiring an emergent operation under general anesthesia. Due to resource limitations, the patient was intubated using an adult-sized video laryngoscope in the prone position. The patient remained stable during the operation and was discharged without complications. A postoperative discussion was held later to review the case and gain insights from the rest of the anesthesiology team. Prone intubation in pediatric patients can be safely accomplished using various techniques, depending on the urgency of the need, the availability of resources, and the knowledge and skills of the provider. The authors hope that their colleagues can learn from sharing this experience."

    "abstract": "Intestinal obstruction is an extremely rare condition among pregnant women, but it can be life-threatening for both mother and fetus. A woman in her late twenties with no history of previous pregnancies was admitted to hospital due to regular preterm contractions and cervical shortening. Seven days after her admission, while the contractions had stopped and cervical length was stable, she complained of acute abdominal pain. Bowel obstruction was suspected due to the patient's history of gastric bypass 5 years earlier for weight loss. Computed tomography was not performed due to risk of fetal irradiation. Conservative management was attempted, but the patient stopped passing flatus and started vomiting. The fetus was delivered by emergency exploratory laparotomy, during which small bowel obstruction due to adhesions was identified and resolved. Although uncommon during pregnancy, small bowel obstruction is far more common in women who have had previous abdominal operations, especially involving the stomach. Obstetricians must maintain a high level of suspicion since this condition can be life-threatening for both the mother and the fetus."

    "abstract": "To identify factors predictive of serious ocular injury requiring urgent consultation by ophthalmology in patients presenting with blunt trauma orbital fractures. This is a retrospective study of adult patients diagnosed with orbital fractures after blunt trauma at a university medical center emergency room. Patient records were examined over a three-year period. Data including mechanism of injury, fracture location, ocular symptoms, and examination findings were recorded. Ocular injuries were divided into three levels of severity: mild, moderate, and severe. Fracture characteristics, patient demographics, and examination findings were analyzed using multinomial regression to identify risk factors for more severe injury. One hundred and eighty-six patients met inclusion criteria. For 29.6% of patients, urgent ophthalmologic consultation was required. Ruptured globes occurred in 2.2% of injuries. There was a statistically significant association between severe ocular injury and three examination findings: poor vision (OR 14.5; p < 0.001), afferent pupillary defect (OR 44.8; p < 0.001), and abnormal pupillary reaction (OR 28.0; p < 0.001). Likewise, blurry vision (OR 3.6; p = 0.018), ocular pain (OR 3.7; p = 0.011), and facial pain (OR 4.4; p = 0.031) were also associated with an increased risk of severe ocular injury. Abnormal pupillary reaction was associated with moderate injury (OR 4.5; p = 0.041). Demographic factors, mechanism of injury, anti-coagulant use, fracture location, diplopia, no documented vision, subconjunctival hemorrhage, chemosis, and motility restriction were not associated with injury severity. Most patients who presented to the emergency room with an orbital fracture did not require urgent ophthalmologic consultation. The presence of blurry vision, ocular pain, facial pain, poor vision, and afferent pupillary defect significantly increased the odds of severe injury. Abnormal pupillary reaction was associated with both moderate and severe injury."

Gallstone ileus does not present with unique symptoms, making diagnosis difficult. It has a high mortality (12 to 27%) due to associated comorbidities and diagnostic delay. The aim of this case report is to communicate the importance of prompt diagnosis and surgical management of gallstone ileus. It is presented the clinical case of a 67-year-old female patient with a history of long-standing diabetes mellitus without medical control, without previous surgical history, who began suffering 2 days prior to admission to the emergency room with signs and symptoms of intestinal occlusion. She was given medical management without improvement and diagnostic delay of mechanical intestinal occlusion that was surgically intervened 7 days after the onset of clinical symptoms, finding gallstone ileus in the exploratory laparotomy, with satisfactory resolution of the pathology despite the diagnostic delay. Gallstone ileus is a difficult clinical entity to diagnose and therefore requires a high index of suspicion.

    "abstract": "Thoracic trauma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children exposed to blast and early recognition of these injuries is vital. While numerous studies have investigated the sensitivity of chest X-ray (CXR) for the detection of chest injury in blunt trauma, none have evaluated its performance in paediatric blast injury. CXR and Computed Tomography (CT) thorax findings were compared for 105 children who were injured by blast and presented to the UK Role 3 Hospital, Camp Bastion, Helmand Province, during the recent conflict in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2013. CXR performance was evaluated compared to the 'gold standard' of CT for the detection of significant thoracic injuries, defined as pneumothorax, haemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, penetrating fragments and pulmonary contusion or laceration. The sensitivity of CXR for the detection of significant injuries was: pneumothorax 43%, haemothorax 40%, contusion 44%, laceration 100%, blast lung 80% and subdermal metallic fragments 75%. CXR missed all cases of diaphragm injury, ≥2 rib fractures, clavicle fracture and pleural effusion, although numbers of each were small. Specificity for CXR injury detection was 94% for contusion and 93% for fragment, and 100% otherwise. The sensitivity and specificity of CXR for identifying an abnormality that would prompt CT imaging was 72% (95% CI 55-85%) and 82% (95% CI 70-90%). CXR has a poor sensitivity for the identification of significant thoracic injury in children exposed to blast. We argue that, given the challenge of clinical assessment of injured children and the potential for serious adverse consequences of missed thoracic injuries, there should be a low threshold for the use of CT chest in the evaluation of children exposed to blast."

This retrospective study evaluated the perioperative factors that guided emergency department transfer of patients to the operating room (OR) where IMN or temporizing external fixation (TEF) was performed, to the intensive care unit (ICU), or to the orthopedic ward. The hypothesis was that patients referred initially to the OR or to the ICU had more serious co-morbidities, complications, or orthopedic polytrauma, increasing the likelihood that they would benefit from \"damage control orthopedics\" and TEF use. A Level I Trauma Center database (2010-2020) review identified the records of 23 patients that met study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most sustained their injury in a motor vehicle accident (87%) and were not wearing a seatbelt. Patients transferred to the operating room had a greater body mass index and shorter times between admission and surgery. Those transferred to the OR or ICU had higher injury severity scores (ISS), higher arterial blood O2 partial pressure (paO2) values on the first post-surgical day, and had more red blood cell unit (RBCU) transfusions during hospitalization. Patients transferred to the ICU more often underwent TEF and had shorter initial surgical procedure duration. Those with pneumothorax, rib fractures, or with other orthopedic comorbidities were more often transferred to the OR or ICU and those with acute complications requiring exploratory laparotomy were transferred to the OR. Patients with higher BMI, ISS, greater RBCU transfusion needs, with pneumothorax, rib fractures, or acute complications requiring exploratory laparotomy were more likely to be initially transferred to the OR or ICU. Patients transferred to the orthopedic ward represented a more heterogenous group with greater possibility for benefitting from earlier definitive IMN."

Despite guidelines urging rapid antibiotic use, data supporting immediate antibiotic initiation in cases of suspected infection are limited. Our hypothesis was that a protocol of specimen-initiated antibiotic initiation would have similar compliance and outcomes to an immediate initiation protocol. We devised a pragmatic cluster-randomized crossover pilot trial. Four surgical and trauma intensive care units were randomized to either an immediate initiation or specimen-initiated antibiotic protocol for intubated patients with suspected pneumonia and bronchoscopically obtained cultures who did not require vasopressors. In the immediate initiation arm, antibiotics were started immediately after the culture regardless of patient status. In the specimen-initiated arm, antibiotics were delayed until objective Gram stain or culture results suggested infection. Each site participated in both arms after a washout period and crossover. Outcomes were protocol compliance, all-cause 30-day mortality, and ventilator-free alive days at 30 days. Standard statistical techniques were applied. A total of 186 patients had 244 total cultures, of which only the first was analyzed. Ninety-three patients (50%) were enrolled in each arm, and 94.6% were trauma patients (84.4% blunt trauma). The median age was 50.5 years, and 21% of the cohort was female. There were no differences in demographics, comorbidities, sequential organ failure assessment, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, or Injury Severity Scores. Antibiotics were started significantly later in the specimen-initiated arm (0 vs. 9.3 hours; p < 0.0001) with 19.4% avoiding antibiotics completely for that episode. There were no differences in the rate of protocol adherence, 30-day mortality, or ventilator-free alive days at 30 days. In this cluster-randomized crossover trial, we found similar compliance rates between immediate and specimen-initiated antibiotic strategies. Specimen-initiated antibiotic protocol in patients with a suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia did not result in worse clinical outcomes compared with immediate initiation.

Patients with survivable injuries face a risk of infection stemming from foreign body transgression into the central nervous system (CNS). There is controversy regarding the utility of antimicrobial prophylaxis in managing such patients, and if so, which antimicrobial agent(s) to use. We reviewed patients with pTBI at our institution and performed a PRISMA systematic review to assess the impact of prophylactic antibiotics on reducing risk of CNS infection. We identified 21 local patients and 327 cases in the literature. In our local series, 17 local patients received prophylactic antibiotics; four did not. Overall, five of these patients (24%) developed a CNS infection (four and one case of intraparenchymal brain abscess and meningitis, respectively). All four patients who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics developed an infection (three with CNS infections; one superficial wound infection) compared to two of 17 (12%) patients who did receive prophylactic antibiotics. Of the 327 pTBI cases reported in the literature, 216 (66%) received prophylactic antibiotics. Thirty-eight (17%) patients who received antibiotics developed a CNS infection compared to 21 (19%) who did not receive antibiotics (p = 0.76). Although our review of the literature did not reveal any benefit, our institutional series suggested that patients with pTBI may benefit from prophylactic antibiotics. We propose a short antibiotic course with a regimen specific to cases with and without the presence of organic debris."

No standard guidelines for treatment are available. We present the case of a 44-year-old female patient with posttraumatic dissection of the abdominal aorta, which was referred to our institution for endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). The patient was referred to our institution after emergency surgery following blunt abdominal trauma due to a car accident. Initial computed tomography (CT), performed at the referring hospital, showed multiple bone injuries with pneumothorax, liver and spleen lacerations, and rupture of the anterior abdominal wall with mesenteric injury and active intraperitoneal extravasation of contrast media from visceral arteries. Initial CT also showed dissection of the distal part of the abdominal aorta. Due to hemodynamic instability, emergency surgery was performed for intraperitoneal injuries. Control computed tomography angiography (CTA) after surgery confirmed a dissection of the distal part of the abdominal aorta at the level of the bifurcation protruding into the right common iliac artery with partial thrombosis of the right iliac artery and no active extravasation of the contrast media at the level of the aorta. An aberrant left renal artery was also identified. A hemodynamically stable patient was transferred to our institution for emergency EVAR which was performed without intraprocedural complications. Control CTA after EVAR showed a good result of the procedure with minimal type 2 endoleak and no extravasation. EVAR can also be used to treat AAI without active extravasation to prevent future total rupture of the aortic wall."

    "abstract": "Early detection of pneumothorax, most often via chest radiography, can help determine need for emergent clinical intervention. The ability to accurately detect and rapidly triage pneumothorax with an artificial intelligence (AI) model could assist with earlier identification and improve care. To compare the accuracy of an AI model vs consensus thoracic radiologist interpretations in detecting any pneumothorax (incorporating both nontension and tension pneumothorax) and tension pneumothorax. This diagnostic study was a retrospective standalone performance assessment using a data set of 1000 chest radiographs captured between June 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. The radiographs were obtained from patients aged at least 18 years at 4 hospitals in the Mass General Brigham hospital network in the United States. Included radiographs were selected using 2 strategies from all chest radiography performed at the hospitals, including inpatient and outpatient. The first strategy identified consecutive radiographs with pneumothorax through a manual review of radiology reports, and the second strategy identified consecutive radiographs with tension pneumothorax using natural language processing. For both strategies, negative radiographs were selected by taking the next negative radiograph acquired from the same radiography machine as each positive radiograph. The final data set was an amalgamation of these processes. Each radiograph was interpreted independently by up to 3 radiologists to establish consensus ground-truth interpretations. Each radiograph was then interpreted by the AI model for the presence of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax. This study was conducted between July and October 2021, with the primary analysis performed between October and November 2021. The primary end points were the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for the detection of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax. The secondary end points were the sensitivities and specificities for the detection of pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax. The final analysis included radiographs from 985 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.8 [19.0] years; 436 [44.3%] female patients), including 307 patients with nontension pneumothorax, 128 patients with tension pneumothorax, and 550 patients without pneumothorax. The AI model detected any pneumothorax with an AUC of 0.979 (95% CI, 0.970-0.987), sensitivity of 94.3% (95% CI, 92.0%-96.3%), and specificity of 92.0% (95% CI, 89.6%-94.2%) and tension pneumothorax with an AUC of 0.987 (95% CI, 0.980-0.992), sensitivity of 94.5% (95% CI, 90.6%-97.7%), and specificity of 95.3% (95% CI, 93.9%-96.6%). These findings suggest that the assessed AI model accurately detected pneumothorax and tension pneumothorax in this chest radiograph data set. The model's use in the clinical workflow could lead to earlier identification and improved care for patients with pneumothorax."

We previously proposed a screening tool, the McGovern score, to identify pediatric trauma patients at high risk for BCVI, and we aim to validate the McGovern score by pooling data from multiple pediatric trauma centers. This is a multi-center, hospital-based, cohort study from all prospectively registered pediatric (<16 years of age) trauma patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) between 2003 and 2017 at six Level 1 pediatric trauma centers. The registry was retrospectively queried for patients who received a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) as a screening method for BCVI. Age, length of follow-up, mechanism of injury (MOI), arrival Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and focal neurological deficit were recorded. Radiological variables queried were the presence of a carotid canal fracture, petrous temporal bone fracture, and CT presence of infarction. Patients with BCVI were queried for mode of treatment, type of intracranial injury, artery damaged, and BCVI injury grade. The McGovern score was calculated for all patients who underwent CTA across all data groups. A total of 1012 patients underwent CTA; 72 of these patients were found to have BCVI, 51 of which were in the validation cohort. Across all data groups, the McGovern score has a >80% sensitivity (SN) and >98% negative predictive value (NPV). The McGovern score for pediatric BCVI is an effective, generalizable screening tool."

    "abstract": "A 10-year-old male with a past medical history of premature pubarche, mild persistent asthma, and eczema presented to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. On examination, he was found to be tachycardic and tachypneic. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, and scattered atelectasis. Echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse. The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU for pericardiocentesis and drain placement. As he later became hypertensive and febrile, we will discuss how our patient's hospital course guided our differential diagnosis and how we arrived at a definitive diagnosis using a multidisciplinary approach."

    "abstract": "Abdominal trauma injuries are caused by many mechanisms including blunt and penetrating trauma injuries. Penetrating injuries are far more common than blunt injuries. Subsequently, the most affected organ during such injuries is small intestine perforations. As far as we know, there were no cases reported before about jejunal injury due to penetrating trauma. We present a case of a 20-year-old male with a stab wound injury who was initially stable in the emergency department (ED). After a set of investigations were done, the patient was discharged home. Yet, the patient presented again with late signs of peritonitis. Imaging was done and showed pneumoperitoneum. Thereafter, the patient was rushed to the operation room (OR) where the jejunal repair was performed. ED physicians must be vigilant regarding any signs of deterioration in penetrating trauma patients and should provide clear instructions to patients regarding any symptoms of the acute abdomen before any discharge."

    "title": "Sigmoid colon perforation secondary to blunt abdominal trauma from cow hoof.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal discomfort is one of the most prevalent complaints presented to the emergency department. When making a clinical diagnosis, blunt trauma with substantial visceral injuries requires a high index of suspicion. The patient went to the emergency room after experiencing lower abdomen discomfort and a fever for two days. He was 40 years old. He says he was injured two days earlier when a cow foot landed on his stomach, causing mild blunt injuries. When examined, he is delicate all the way down in his lower belly. Results from the lab indicated a higher-than-normal total leucocyte count. Echogenic bowel thickening is seen on point-of-care ultrasonography (PoCUS) of the lower abdomen. Abdominal CT with contrast revealed oedema, heterogeneous enhancement, and a focal stretch of thickened circumferential mural including the sigmoid colon and peri-colonic fat stranding. Biopsy results from a sigmoidoscopy revealed significant sigmoid colon constriction and localized areas of active inflammation. Stricture development after a Sigmoid hole caused by a cow foot injury is an extremely unusual occurrence. This case emphasizes the need of a thorough history and physical examination, especially in a high-pressure emergency scenario, and the value of using ultrasonography at the bedside to make a definitive diagnosis and improve patient care. Regardless of the severity of abdominal damage caused by cattle collision, early imaging should be explored since delaying action might result in poor results."

    "abstract": "To assess the incidence of undertriage in major trauma, its determinant, and association with mortality. A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from a French regional trauma registry (2011-2017). All major trauma (Injury Severity Score ≥ 16) cases aged ≥ 18 years and managed by a physician-led mobile medical team were included. Those transported to a level-II/III trauma centre were considered as undertriaged. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with undertriage. A total of 7110 trauma patients were screened; 2591 had an ISS ≥ 16 and 320 (12.4%) of these were undertriaged. Older patients had higher risk for undertriage (51-65 years: OR = 1.60, 95% CI [1.11; 2.26], p = 0.01). Conversely, injury mechanism (fall from height: 0.62 [0.45; 0.86], p = 0.01; gunshot/stab injuries: 0.45 [0.22; 0.90], p = 0.02), on-scene time (> 60 min: 0.62 [0.40; 0.95], p = 0.03), prehospital endotracheal intubation (0.53 [0.39; 0.71], p < 0.001), and prehospital focussed assessment with sonography [FAST] (0.15 [0.08; 0.29], p < 0.001) were associated with a lower risk for undertriage. After adjusting for severity, undertriage was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (1.22 [0.80; 1.89], p = 0.36). In our physician-led prehospital EMS system, undertriage was higher than recommended. Advanced aged was identified as a risk factor highlighting the urgent need for tailored triage protocol in this population. Conversely, the potential benefit of prehospital FAST on triage performance should be furthered explored as it may reduce undertriage. Fall from height and penetrating trauma were associated with a lower risk for undertriage suggesting that healthcare providers should remain vigilant of the potential seriousness of trauma associated with low-energy mechanisms."

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic's main concerns are limiting the spread of infectious diseases and upgrading the delivery of health services, infrastructure, and therapeutic provision. The goal of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the emergency experience and delay of elective abdominal surgical intervention at King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital from October 2019 to October 2020, with a focus on post-operative morbidity and mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compares two groups of patients with emergent and elective abdominal surgical procedures between two different periods; the population was divided into two groups: the control group, which included 403 surgical patients, and the lockdown group, which included 253 surgical patients. During the lockdown, surgical activity was reduced by 37.2% (p = 0.014), and patients were more likely to require reoperations and blood transfusions during or after surgery (p= 0.002, 0.021, and 0.018, respectively). During the lockdown period, the average length of stay increased from 3.43 to 5.83 days (p = 0.002), and the patients who developed complications (53.9%) were more than those in the control period (46.1%) (p = 0.001). Our tertiary teaching hospital observed a significant decline in the overall number of surgeries performed during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown period. During the lockdown, abdominal surgery was performed only on four patients; they were positive for COVID-19. Three of them underwent exploratory laparotomy; two of the three developed shock post-operative; one patient had colon cancer (ASA score 3), one had colon disease (ASA score 2), and two had perforated bowels (ASA scores 2 and 4, respectively). Two out of four deaths occurred after surgery. Our results showed the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on surgical care as both 30-day mortality and total morbidity have risen considerably."

    "abstract": "Early balanced transfusion is associated with improved outcome in haemorrhagic shock patients. This study describes the implementation and evaluates the safety of a whole blood transfusion program in a civilian helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS). This prospective observational study was performed over a 5-year period at HEMS-Bergen, Norway. Patients in haemorrhagic shock receiving out of hospital transfusion of low-titre Group O whole blood (LTOWB) or other blood components were included. Two LTOWB units were produced weekly and rotated to the HEMS for forward storage. The primary endpoints were the number of patients transfused, mechanisms of injury/illness, adverse events and survival rates. Informed consent covered patient pathway from time of emergency interventions to last endpoint and subsequent data handling/storage. The HEMS responded to 5124 patients. Seventy-two (1.4%) patients received transfusions. Twenty patients (28%) were excluded due to lack of consent (16) or not meeting the inclusion criteria (4). Of the 52 (100%) patients, 48 (92%) received LTOWB, nine (17%) received packed red blood cells (PRBC), and nine (17%) received freeze-dried plasma. Of the forty-six (88%) patients admitted alive to hospital, 35 (76%) received additional blood transfusions during the first 24 h. Categories were blunt trauma 30 (58%), penetrating trauma 7 (13%), and nontrauma 15 (29%). The majority (79%) were male, with a median age of 49 (IQR 27-70) years. No transfusion reactions, serious complications or logistical challenges were reported. Overall, 36 (69%) patients survived 24 h, and 28 (54%) survived 30 days. Implementing a whole blood transfusion program in civilian HEMS is feasible and safe and the logistics around out of hospital whole blood transfusions are manageable.

    "abstract": "Ultrasound has historically been limited to in-hospital use for the diagnosis and management of various conditions. However, with the advent of smaller and more portable devices, this technology can be used outside the hospital. This report describes a patient with chest pain and hypotension for whom a point-of-care cardiac ultrasound (POCUS) was performed to diagnose cardiac tamponade during critical care transport. She was subsequently found to have an acute type A aortic dissection, and her care was expedited to the operating room. Cardiac tamponade in the setting of acute type A aortic dissection requires urgent surgical repair; therefore, early diagnosis is crucial to survival. In this case, prehospital ultrasound facilitated rapid care for the patient. Further study is needed to define its role in the prehospital setting."

    "abstract": "Esophageal duplication cyst (EDC) is a type of gastrointestinal duplication cyst that involves congenital malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. EDCs are frequently found in the mediastinum and thoracoabdominal region, but rarely occur in the abdominal cavity. However, intra-abdominal EDCs are frequently found in the upper abdomen near the abdominal esophagus. Here, we report, for the first time, a case of intra-abdominal EDC that occurred in the ileum. A 14-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with complaints of epigastric pain and vomiting. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a cystic tumor in the pelvis, suspected of ovarian origin. She was admitted to our gynecology department and underwent emergency surgery. The laparoscopic examination revealed that both ovaries were intact and that a primary tumor had developed from the ileal mesentery. Since the patient's condition was not urgent at the time of the gynecological surgery, the procedure was completed by only performing exploratory laparotomy; the patient was admitted to our department after the surgery. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging performed on the next day revealed a cystic mass measuring 90 × 65 mm with a smooth margin and homogeneous signal intensity, arising posterior to the uterus. The mass was suspected as an intestinal duplication cyst. On another day, after the examinations were completed, we resected the portion of the small intestine containing the tumor by laparoscopy. The patient had a successful postoperative course and was discharged on the 5th postoperative day. Histological examination showed that the cyst was lined by stratified squamous epithelium, contained esophageal glands, and had a two-layer muscularis propria. Therefore, a diagnosis of intra-abdominal EDC was performed. An intra-abdominal EDC cyst is relatively rare; this is the first case reported at the distal ileum."

    "abstract": "The extended Focused Assessment With Sonography for Trauma (E-FAST) has become a cornerstone of the diagnostic workup in patients with trauma. The added value of a diagnostic workup including an E-FAST to support decision-making remains unknown. To determine how often an immediate course of action adopted in the resuscitation room based on a diagnostic workup that included an E-FAST and before whole-body computed tomography scanning (WBCT) in patients with blunt trauma was appropriate. This cohort study was conducted at 6 French level I trauma centers between November 5, 2018, and November 5, 2019. Consecutive patients treated for blunt trauma were assessed at the participating centers. Data analysis took place in February 2022. Diagnostic workup associating E-FAST (including abdominal, thoracic, pubic, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography scan), systematic clinical examination, and chest and pelvic radiographs. The main outcome criterion was the appropriateness of the observed course of action (including abstention) in the resuscitation room according to evaluation by a masked expert panel. Of 515 patients screened, 510 patients (99.0%) were included. Among the 510 patients included, 394 were men (77.3%), the median (IQR) age was 46 years (29-61 years), and the median (IQR) Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 24 (17-34). Based on the initial diagnostic workup, no immediate therapeutic action was deemed necessary in 233 cases (45.7%). Conversely, the following immediate therapeutic actions were initiated before WBCT: 6 emergency laparotomies (1.2%), 2 pelvic angioembolisations (0.4%), 52 pelvic binders (10.2%), 41 chest drains (8.0%) and 16 chest decompressions (3.1%), 60 osmotherapies (11.8%), and 6 thoracotomies (1.2%). To improve cerebral blood flow based on transcranial doppler recordings, norepinephrine was initiated in 108 cases (21.2%). In summary, the expert panel considered the course of action appropriate in 493 of 510 cases (96.7%; 95% CI, 94.7%-98.0%). Among the 17 cases (3.3%) with inappropriate course of action, 13 (76%) corresponded to a deviation from existing guidelines and 4 (24%) resulted from an erroneous interpretation of the E-FAST. This prospective, multicenter cohort study found that a diagnostic resuscitation room workup for patients with blunt trauma that included E-FAST with clinical assessment and targeted chest and pelvic radiographs was associated with the determination of an appropriate course of action prior to WBCT."

    "abstract": "We assessed the use of conservative management for American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade V renal trauma in the National Trauma Databank. We used data of grade V renal trauma patients in the 2017-2019 National Trauma Databank. Conservative management was defined by the absence of surgical or procedural intervention except for ureteral stent or percutaneous drain placement. We initially analyzed patients who survived to final hospital discharge and reported the percent utilization of conservative management. We then repeated our analysis in the overall grade V population and in all those who did not die in the emergency department. Of 1,474 who survived to discharge, 557 (37.8%) patients were managed conservatively. In the adjusted analysis, penetrating trauma mechanism (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.19, P < .001) and receiving transfusion (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.17-0.29, P < .001) were associated with decreased odds of receiving conservative management. Overall, there were 1,919 patients with grade V injury, of whom 731 (38.1%) were managed conservatively. Mortality rate was 22.8% in those managed conservatively vs 23.8% in those who had intervention. After excluding 110 patients who died in the emergency department, there were 1,809 patients, of whom 625 (34.6%) were managed conservatively. Mortality rate was 22.6% in the operatively managed group and 10.9% in the conservatively managed group. A substantial portion of grade V renal trauma cases were managed successfully without intervention in the National Trauma Databank. Further research is needed to identify radiological phenotypes suitable for nonoperative management and to overcome possible renal trauma grade misclassification."

    "abstract": "Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is recognized as the most common surgical emergency following abdominal procedures. Moreover, a pneumothorax secondary to an SBO is an infrequent phenomenon less commonly reported in recent literature. Clinical presentation includes progressive dyspnea and fatigue. The diagnosis was made with imaging. In this case report, the authors present a rare case of concurrent surgical complications (pneumothorax, SBO, perforation of the stomach, and hiatal hernia). A 62 years-old African American patient who presented with severe sudden onset difficulty breathing two days following laparoscopic toupet fundoplication procedure. She was given oxygen via cannula and the underwent chest tube insertion. She was then transferred to different facility under care of a cardio thoracic surgeon. Although SBO is most common emergency following an abdominal procedure, pneumothorax is rarely reported. This case report depicts a unique presentation of pneumothorax secondary to SBO and a discussion section conferring complication risk versus benefits of diverse management modalities (surgical or conservative), and a review of recent literature, further aiding healthcare professionals in the diagnosis and management of patients with SBO complications. Review of this case and the literature show a rare presentation of secondary pneumothorax following exploratory laparotomy for SBO. Recognizing the clinical signs and even a small suspicion should prompt one to order imaging. Chest X-ray is inexpensive and can rapidly rule out pneumothorax. These complications have high mortality in patients above the age of 60 years, hence, timely management is of utmost importance."

    "abstract": "A diaphragmatic hernia is a protrusion of the abdominal contents into the negative pressure thoracic cavity through a congenital or acquired diaphragmatic defect. Generally, acquired diaphragmatic hernia is a rare, life-threatening condition that usually follows blunt/penetrating trauma or an iatrogenic cause, resulting in the diaphragmatic rupture, accompanied by the herniation of abdominal visceral organs. We report a 47-year-old male construction worker who sustained a fall from a height of about 30 feet height. He presented with hypoxia initially and, after a primary survey, was found to have a traumatic rupture of the diaphragm with herniation of the stomach and abdominal contents, causing signs of obstructive shock. After adequate resuscitation in the Emergency Department, he was rushed to operating room. There, he suffered two very short pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrests. Therefore, an emergency anterolateral thoracotomy was done, and it was extended into laparotomy to reduce the abdominal contents through the diaphragmatic tear of 12 cm, which restored the spontaneous circulation. He recovered eventually, despite chest infections and pulmonary atelectasis, and was discharged on the 28th day and remained in good condition during the outpatient visit. Tension gastrothorax or viscerothorax is rare, but an under-recognized cause of cardiac arrest in the trauma setting necessitates a vigilant evaluation and early suspicion to prevent a catastrophic outcome. This case report emphasizes the inclusion of tension viscero or abdominal thorax as one of the recognizable causes of a pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest."

    "abstract": "We report the case of an 89-year-old woman who was struck by a car while walking and fell to the ground. She had hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cerebral infarction requiring medication. She was transported to a nearby acute critical care center. Upon arrival, her vital signs were stable. A physical examination showed right facial and hip contusion, right shoulder tenderness, a right elbow contusional lacerated wound, and bilateral knee abrasion wounds. She vomited when her face moved. Radiological studies showed a right proximal humerus fracture and a right minor ischial fracture. Her injury severity score (ISS) was 5 points, and her probability of surviving was 97.8%. However, a blood test revealed an extremely high fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) level (573.3 μg/mL). Because of this elevated FDP value and her inability to walk due to vomiting on motion, she remained in the emergency room (ER) for monitoring. At five hours from arrival, she became comatose, and hypotension and bradycardia (30 beats per minute) were noted followed by cardiac arrest. She underwent advanced cardiac life support and obtained spontaneous circulation. Repeated blood tests showed hyperkalemia, anemia, and hypoglycemia. She immediately underwent infusion of glucose and insulin and continuous infusion of catecholamine. Repeated whole-body CT scans revealed only increased hematomas where the fractures and contusions existed. She was admitted to the ICU. Her post-admission course was quite eventful. She required transfusion until the fourth hospital day to control circulation and anemia and underwent transfusion of 28 units of red blood cells, 30 units of platelets, and four units of fresh-frozen plasma in total. After her circulation and respiratory function had stabilized, she was extubated. However, her condition became complicated with the deterioration of her knee wounds and gall bladder inflammation in the ward. All complications were treated by non-operative management. She was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on day 70. This report discusses our experience with a blunt trauma patient in whom a high FDP level on arrival was the only clue indicating the deterioration of her condition. Such patients need close observation with hospitalization."

    "abstract": "Traumatic rib fracture is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies highlight the inadequacy of age and the number of rib fractures (NRFs) to assess patients' care needs, which may unnecessarily increase the burden of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Therefore, we sought to clarify the clinical outcomes of patients admitted to a level I trauma center with multiple blunt-trauma rib fractures by age and fracture location. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 18-95 admitted to Doctors Hospital at Renaissance Health with multiple rib fractures during 2017-2020. Patients with major vascular/cerebral injuries or emergency surgery from other injuries were excluded. The study population comprised 71 patients aged ≤65 and 53 patients aged >65 years. The primary study outcomes included mortality and non-home discharge. ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS), total hospital length of stay (HLOS), and days on the ventilator were the secondary outcomes. Study outcomes were also analyzed by stratifying patients by fracture location. Patients aged >65 years with multiple blunt-trauma rib fractures had lower mortality rates despite a higher prevalence of comorbidities but with higher rates of non-home discharges compared to younger patients. However, the mortality and non-home discharge odds ratios were not statistically significant. Also, median ICU-LOS and HLOS were numerically higher in geriatric patients but were not statistically significant. Nonetheless, younger patients required significantly more days of respiratory support than older patients. Similar differences were observed in the clinical outcome of patients ≤65 or >65 years when stratified by fracture locations. Young patients with blunt trauma rib fractures may have similar, if not worse, clinical outcomes than geriatric patients. These findings underscore the need for individual assessment of the patient's trauma severity independent of age, the number of rib fractures, or fracture location to reduce ICU burden."

Our case is unusual as the ovarian mass was misdiagnosed as ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Only three such cases have been previously reported in the literature. A 28-year-old multigravida with three months of amenorrhea presented with vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and gradually increasing vertigo for six days with increased intensity in the last four hours. On examination, she was conscious and oriented, clinically moderate pallor was present, her pulse rate was 112 beats per minute (bpm), and her blood pressure (BP) was 98/68 mm Hg. On abdominal examination, there was no palpable abdominal mass, but left iliac fossa guarding and tenderness were present. On per-vaginal examination, the uterus was eight weeks in size, the right fornix was free, the left fornix was full and tender, and cervical motion tenderness was present. Her urine pregnancy test was positive. Transvaginal sonography was performed in the emergency setting, which showed a bulky uterus with thickened endometrium and a non-visualized right ovary, and the left ovary was seen adjacent to a hyperechoic collection in the pouch of Douglas of size 3.5×3.5×1.8 cm, likely organized hematoma; there was free fluid in the pouch of Douglas, and left forniceal tenderness was also present. In view of the clinical evidence of tachycardia and hypotension, an exploratory laparotomy was performed for suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and the ovarian mass was excised. The histopathological examination (HPE) of the ovarian mass showed findings suggestive of luteoma of pregnancy. There is an extreme paucity of literature on luteoma of pregnancy. That, along with the rarity of the lesion, results in it often not being kept in mind as a differential diagnosis on clinical or radiological examination, thereby leading to more aggressive management. Obstetricians and gynecologists need to be aware of this condition so that it is kept as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with adnexal masses. A vigilant outlook will help in preventing unnecessary radical surgery during pregnancy, thereby preserving the ovary and reducing morbidity in these young females."

A retrospective observational study was conducted using prospectively collected data derived from the Scottish Trauma Audit Group (STAG) from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2018. Peripheral and non-aortocaval vascular trauma patients were identified using Abbreviated Injury Severity (AIS) codes. Demographics, mechanisms, types of injury, severity, and outcomes were analysed. Of 30 831 patients admitted with trauma to Scottish hospitals, 569 (1.8%) patients suffered a vascular injury during the eight year study period with 275 (0.9%) patients sustaining a peripheral or non-aortocaval vascular injury. There were 221 (80%) men and 54 (20%) women with a median (range) age of 39 (14 - 88) years. Blunt trauma was responsible for 179 (65%) injuries, of which road traffic accidents were the most common mechanism. A further 67 (24%) injuries were due to penetrating trauma, of which assault was the most common cause. The most common injury was to abdominal arteries (e.g., hepatic, renal, splenic [n = 83]) with an associated mortality rate of 17%. The median (range) Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 16 (4 - 75). Sixteen (6%) patients died in the Emergency Department (ED). Two hundred and twenty-seven (83%) patients were taken to theatre during their admission with a 30 day peri-operative mortality rate of 10%, compared with an overall mortality rate of 16%. Injuries to an abdominal vein (e.g., portal, renal, splenic, superior mesenteric) had the highest number of associated deaths, with 11 (32%) of 34 cases resulting in a fatality. There is a low incidence of vascular trauma in Scotland. Blunt force was responsible for more vascular injuries than penetrating trauma. Patients with peripheral and non-aortocaval vascular injuries are likely to be severely injured and suffer a high mortality rate."

    "abstract": "Bi-femoral axillary bypass graft placement is a well-known and typically safe procedure. It is generally indicated for patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease, aortoiliac occlusive disease, or infectious artery disease. In rare cases, the graft can be fractured or dislodged after placement, though most often, this occurs almost exclusively at the anastomosis site, secondary to blunt trauma. Using ultrasonic imaging is a reliable method of detecting these fractures. We present a case of a bi-femoral axillary bypass graft fracture in a 68-year-old male with the development of a pseudoaneurysm in the right lateral abdominal wall. The patient reported spontaneous development of a \"strange\" sensation in his right lower abdomen and a \"painful lump\" upon waking. Physical examination showed a small right lower quadrant outpouching which was pulsatile on palpation. The initial workup included a bedside ultrasound which showed a fractured graft with the fluid collection and a Doppler signal. Vascular surgery was immediately consulted for evaluation, and the patient was taken to the operating room for emergent surgical repair. CT angiography confirmed a successful operation in which an 8 mm graft was placed to anastomose the original bypass graft fracture site. The patient remained stable postoperatively and was discharged without further complications. This report highlights the importance of using ultrasonography for the immediate identification of potential graft complications to prevent serious complications and expedite definitive management."

Increasingly available, affordable and portable, with emerging evidence of improved patient outcomes, point-of-care ultrasound has become a valuable tool in the emergency setting. This state-of-the-art review describes the feasibility of point-of-care ultrasound practice, training and maintenance of competence. It also describes the many uses of point-of-care ultrasound for the anaesthetist and describes the most salient point-of-care ultrasound views for anaesthetic emergencies including: undifferentiated shock; hypoxemia; and trauma. Procedural safety is also discussed in addition to relevant important governance aspects. Cardiac function should be assessed using the parasternal long axis, parasternal short basal/mid-papillary/apical, apical four chamber and subcostal four chamber views, and should include a visual estimation of global left ventricular ejection fraction. Other cardiovascular conditions that can be identified using point-of-care ultrasound include: pericardial effusion; cardiac tamponade; and pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary emergency conditions that can be diagnosed using point-of-care ultrasound include pneumothorax; pleural effusion; and interstitial syndrome. The extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma examination may of value in patients who are hypotensive in order to identify intra-abdominal haemorrhage, pneumothoraces and haemothoraces."

    "title": "A Rare and Severe Cause of Abdominal Pain in a Hemodialysis Patient.",
    "abstract": "Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) and aeroportia have been rarely described in hemodialysis patients. We present a case of a 64-year-old woman on regular hemodialysis who presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Abdominal CT showed pneumatosis intestinalis and aeroportia suggestive of ischemic abnormalities. In this case, given the absence of transmural necrosis or bowel perforation, aeroportia seemed to be caused by nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI), an increasingly recognized complication in hemodialysis patients. The patient was proposed for emergent exploratory laparotomy; however, she had a fatal outcome. Hemodialysis-dependent patients should be considered at risk of the \"low-flow syndrome\" of mesenteric arterial circulation. Prevention is crucial, and early detection of these entities is important for prompt diagnosis and management of mesenteric ischemia."

    "abstract": "Background Needle decompression is a useful tool in the pre-hospital setting for treating tension pneumothorax. However the specific improvements in vital signs that determine a successful decompression are only reported in a few studies and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) self-reported assessments of improvement are more commonplace. We hypothesize that EMS reports may exaggerate improvement when compared to objective vital sign changes. Methodology This is a retrospective cohort study using the National Emergency Medicine Information System (NEMSIS) for the year 2020. Vital signs recorded as objective endpoints include systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Univariate analysis was performed using the t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Results A total of 8,219 calls were included in the sample size analyzed. Most patients were white (2,911, 35.4%) and male (6,694, 81.4%). Abnormal vitals recorded as indications for needle decompression included SBP <100 mmHg, HR <60 or >100 beats/minute, RR <12 or >20 breaths/minute, and SpO2 <93%. Statistically significant improvements were seen in the number of abnormal vital signs after the procedure. The percentage of improvement was higher in the EMS self-reported assessment than in objective findings for oxygen saturation and SBP. Conclusions Our analysis shows objective improvement of hypoxia and hypotension after field needle decompression, supporting the efficacy of the procedure. The improvement based on vital sign change is modest and is less than that reported by EMS assessment of global improvement. This represents a target for quality improvement in EMS practice."

    "abstract": "Agitation on arrival in trauma patients is known as a sign of impending demise. The aim of this study is to determine outcomes for trauma patients who present in an agitated state. We hypothesized that agitation in the trauma bay is an early indicator for hemorrhage in trauma patients. We performed a single-institution prospective observational study from September 2018 to December 2020 that included any trauma patient who arrived agitated, defined as a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of +1 to +4. Variables collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, admission physiology, blood alcohol level, toxicity screen, and injury severity. The primary outcomes were need for massive transfusion (≥ 10 units) and need for emergent therapeutic intervention for hemorrhage control (laparotomy, preperitoneal pelvic packing, sternotomy, thoracotomy, or angioembolization). Of 4657 trauma admissions, 77 (2%) patients arrived agitated. Agitated patients were younger (40 versus 46, P = 0.03), predominantly male (94% versus 66%, P < 0.0001) sustained more penetrating trauma (31% versus 12%, P < 0.0001), had a lower systolic blood pressure (127 versus 137, P < 0.0001), and a higher Injury Severity Score (17 versus 9, P < 0.0001). On multivariable logistic regression, agitation was independently associated with massive transfusion (odds ratio: 2.63 [1.20-5.77], P = 0.02) and emergent therapeutic intervention for hemorrhage control (odds ratio: 2.60 [1.35-5.03], P = 0.005). Agitation in trauma patients may serve as an early indicator of hemorrhagic shock, as agitation is independently associated with a two-fold increase in the need for massive transfusion and emergent therapeutic intervention for hemorrhage control."

While the incidence and management of tamponade in atrial fibrillation ablation have been extensively described, the data on tamponade during ventricular ablations are very limited. The purpose of this study is to shed light on the incidence, typical perforation sites, and optimal management as observed through real-life data in a tertiary referral center for ventricular ablation. Consecutive patients with structural heart disease undergoing ventricular tachycardia ablation from 2008-2020 were analyzed. Of the 1078 patients undergoing 1287 ventricular ablation procedures, 20 procedures (1.5%) were complicated by cardiac tamponade. In all but one patient, the tamponade was treated with emergent pericardial drainage, while nine patients eventually underwent surgical repair. The perforation occurred during transseptal or subxiphoid puncture in six patients, during ventricle mapping in two patients, and during ablation in five patients (predominantly basal left ventricle). Steam pop as definite perforation cause could only be established in two patients. Regardless of the management of the complication, all patients survived to discharge. Cardiac tamponade during ventricular ablation occurred in 1.5% of the procedures. In nine patients cardiac repair was necessary. Perforation was mostly associated with subxiphoid puncture or ablation of the basal left ventricle."

    "abstract": "Uganda ranks among the countries with the highest burden of TB the world and tuberculous pericarditis (TBP) affects up to 2% of people diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis worldwide. In Africa, it represents the most common cause of pericardial disease. Here, we present the case of a 21-year-old male patient who was diagnosed of cardiac tamponade due to tuberculous pericarditis with a positive urine LF-LAM. We report a case of a 21-year-old male living in Oyam district, Uganda, who presented to the emergency department with difficulty in breathing, easy fatigability, general body weakness, and abdominal pain. A chest X-ray showed the presence of right pleural effusion and massive cardiomegaly. Thus, percutaneous pericardiocentesis was performed immediately and pericardial fluid resulted negative both for gram staining and real-time PCR test Xpert MTB/RIF. The following day's urine LF-LAM test resulted positive, and antitubercular therapy started with gradual improvement. During the follow-up visits, the patient remained asymptomatic, reporting good compliance to the antitubercular therapy. Our case highlights the potential usefulness of a LF-LAM-based diagnostic approach, suggesting that, in low-resource settings, this test might be used as part of routine diagnostic workup in patients with pericardial disease or suspected extra-pulmonary tuberculosis."

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and intra-abdominal injuries (IAIs) are 2 leading causes of traumatic death and disability in children. To avoid missed or delayed diagnoses leading to increased morbidity, computed tomography (CT) is used liberally. However, the overuse of CT leads to inefficient care and radiation-induced malignancies. Therefore, to maximize precision and minimize the overuse of CT, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) previously derived clinical prediction rules for identifying children at high risk and very low risk for IAIs undergoing acute intervention and clinically important TBIs after blunt trauma in large cohorts of children who are injured. This study aimed to validate the IAI and age-based TBI clinical prediction rules for identifying children at high risk and very low risk for IAIs undergoing acute intervention and clinically important TBIs after blunt trauma. This was a prospective 6-center observational study of children aged <18 years with blunt torso or head trauma. Consistent with the original derivation studies, enrolled children underwent routine history and physical examinations, and the treating clinicians completed case report forms prior to knowledge of CT results (if performed). Medical records were reviewed to determine clinical courses and outcomes for all patients, and for those who were discharged from the emergency department, a follow-up survey via a telephone call or SMS text message was performed to identify any patients with missed IAIs or TBIs. The primary outcomes were IAI undergoing acute intervention (therapeutic laparotomy, angiographic embolization, blood transfusion, or intravenous fluid for ≥2 days for pancreatic or gastrointestinal injuries) and clinically important TBI (death from TBI, neurosurgical procedure, intubation for >24 hours for TBI, or hospital admission of ≥2 nights due to a TBI on CT). Prediction rule accuracy was assessed by measuring rule classification performance, using standard point and 95% CI estimates of the operational characteristics of each prediction rule (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic likelihood ratios). The project was funded in 2016, and enrollment was completed on September 1, 2021. Data analyses are expected to be completed by December 2022, and the primary study results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2023. This study will attempt to validate previously derived clinical prediction rules to accurately identify children at high and very low risk for clinically important IAIs and TBIs. Assuming successful validation, widespread implementation is then indicated, which will optimize the care of children who are injured by better aligning CT use with need. RR1-10.2196/43027."

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of race and ethnicity on prehospital analgesic use by emergency medical services (EMS) in trauma patients. Retrospective chart review of adult trauma patients aged 18 to 89 years old transported by EMS to our American College of Surgeons-verified level 1 trauma center from 2014 to 2020. Patients who identified as Black, Asian, Native American, or Other for race and/or Hispanic or Latino or Unknown for ethnicity were considered REM. Patients who identified as White, non-Hispanic were considered White. Groups were compared in univariate and multivariate analysis. The primary outcome was prehospital analgesic administration. A total of 2,476 patients were transported by EMS (47% White and 53% REM). White patients were older on average (46 years vs 38 years; p < 0.001) and had higher rates of blunt trauma (76% vs 60%; p < 0.001). There were no differences in Injury Severity Score (21 vs 20; p = 0.22). Although REM patients reported higher subjective pain rating (7.2 vs 6.6; p = 0.002), they were less likely to get prehospital pain medication (24% vs 35%; p < 0.001), and that difference remained significant after controlling for baseline characteristics, transport method, pain rating, prehospital hypotension, and payor status (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], 0.67 [0.47 to 0.96]; p = 0.03). Patients from racial and ethnic minority groups were less likely to receive prehospital pain medication after traumatic injury than White patients.

We report the case of a 50-year-old male who collapsed suddenly and was declared dead in the Trauma and Emergency Unit of the hospital before admission. Autopsy findings revealed 250 mL of blood and a 206 g blood clot in the pericardial cavity with a vertical tear on the posterolateral surface of the left ventricle with focal hemorrhagic myocardium consistent with acute myocardial infarction. The cause of death was CT as a result of myocardial rupture due to acute myocardial infarction. The gross and histopathological findings were diagnostic and revealed thrombosis of the left circumflex artery, transmural myocardial infarction, and ruptured myocardium of the left ventricle."

Complete UR is defined as a direct communication between the uterine cavity and the peritoneum due to a complete rupture of the myometrium. Here, we present 2 cases of non-surgical management of UR following vaginal delivery, which were both treated by uterine transarterial embolization (UAE). A 26-year-old woman (G0P0) was referred to the emergency ward at 35 weeks of amenorrhea to treat the rupture of membranes, in the context of twin pregnancy. A vaginal delivery was performed and blood loss exceeded 2 liters. Gelatin sponge was injected in an attempt to occlude the right uterine artery. The injection was unsuccessful. After the medical team's discussion, it was decided to definitively occlude the right uterine artery. A 37-year-old woman (G3P3) was referred for a vaginal delivery for a medical termination at 38 weeks of amenorrhea. The ultrasound revealed a left latero-uterine pelvic hematoma, suggestive of UR. Four fibered coils were used to definitively occlude the left uterine artery. Computed tomography scan showed a progressive resorption of hematoma and satisfactory enhancement of the uterine wall in the 2 cases. Transarterial embolization may allow for bleeding to stop without resorting to exploratory laparotomy, with ad-integrum restitution of the uterine wall, and thus prevent a potential hysterectomy. The findings in these 2 cases suggest that UAE should be considered if pregnant women develop UR after delivery."

    "abstract": "A penetrating injury to the thoracic aorta is an extremely rare, life-threatening condition, with a high overall mortality rate. The incidence of a penetrating injury to the aortic arch is unknown because the majority of patients die before receiving adequate treatment due to excessive bleeding. Through a literature review, 23 cases of favorable outcomes were found. We report the first case from the Arab Gulf states. We present the extremely rare case of a 23-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with stable hemodynamics after being stabbed in the left supraclavicular region. The investigation revealed that he suffered from aortic arch transection and contrast extravasation. The patient was rushed to the operating room, where a primary repair was performed through a median sternotomy approach. The patient was discharged on the 14th postoperative day without complications. Penetrating chest trauma (aortic arch injury) is uncommon, and it is typically fatal at the scene or time of injury, even in patients who arrive at the emergency department alive or while undergoing surgery. CT aortography should be performed on patients with normal vital signs but abnormal clinical findings suggestive of a vascular injury. For injuries of types II to IV without concomitant injuries, immediate surgical repair is recommended. Aortic arch penetrating injuries continue to be extremely lethal. Emergency surgical repair remains the standard of care and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. However, managing such uncommon injuries remains a formidable challenge. We encourage additional studies."

General surgical residency case log requirements may also be affected. This study describes the impact of moving a level I trauma center to a different zip code location, on the hospital and resident trauma case volumes. Methods This retrospective analysis included all patients within the local trauma registry across two fiscal years representing the pre- and post-move timeframes. Variables collected included patient basic sociodemographic and injury information, trauma activation level and transfer status, management (operative management [OPM] versus non-operative management [NOPM]), and resident case logs. Results During fiscal years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, 3,025 patients were included. Pre-move and post-move trauma volumes were 1,208 and 1,817 respectively. Post-move changes demonstrated differences in basic sociodemographics, with differences in age (six years older), a shift toward white and away from black (12.89%), and males being seen more frequently (11.87%). Injury severity score distribution shifted (7.72%) towards less severe trauma scores (<15), the percentage of patients with blunt trauma (4.19%) and falls increased (ground level and greater than 1 meter, 9.78%) while the number of patients considered full activations were decreased (15.67%). Proportions of OPM and NOPM trauma cases remained unchanged with the exception of a reduction in emergent operative trauma (3.1%). Resident case logs requirements were met both pre- and post-move. Conclusion Relocating the trauma center to a different zip code location did not negatively impact our resident case volumes. Total trauma volumes were increased, with a shift in the demographics and severity distribution of injuries."

We present a case of a 44-year-old male who fell from a three-story building and presented with complaints of shortness of breath and chest pain. On examination, his chest compression test and extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (E-FAST) were positive. Chest X-ray showed loss of diaphragmatic contour, fracture of fifth to eleventh ribs on the left side, and opacities in the left hemithorax. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bowel loops over the left hemithorax with grade 1 splenic injury. A diagnosis of ruptured diaphragmatic hernia with grade I splenic injury was made and emergency primary repair of the diaphragm was done via thoracotomy. Clinical diagnosis of TDI is difficult and can be misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax. In addition, the subtle presentation can often be missed. CT scan of the chest and abdomen is the imaging of choice to reach a diagnosis. Once diagnosed, emergency surgery via laparotomy or thoracotomy is mandatory. Delay in diagnosis can have a fatal consequence or delayed complications which have high mortality. Diaphragmatic injury should be suspected in all blunt thoracoabdominal traumas, and the presence of this injury should be excluded to prevent late complications. Timely intervention can provide excellent outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Abdominal trauma among severely injured patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of 16 and above can lead to potentially life-threatening injuries that might need immediate surgical intervention. Traumatic injuries to the diaphragm (TID) are a challenging condition often accompanied by other injuries in the thoracoabdominal region. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the occurrence and clinical course of TID among severely injured patients treated at our center between 2008 and 2019 and compared them to other groups of severely injured patients without TID. Results: Thirty-five patients with TID and a median ISS of 41 were treated in the period mentioned above. They were predominantly middle-aged men and mostly victims of blunt trauma as a consequence of motor vehicle accidents. A total of 70.6% had left-sided TID, and in 69.6%, the size of defect was larger than 10 cm. The diagnosis was made with computed tomography (CT) in 68.6% of the cases, while in 25.8%, it was made intraoperatively or delayed by a false-negative initial CT scan, and in 5.7%, an intraoperative diagnosis was made without preoperative CT imaging. Surgical repair was mostly conducted via laparotomy, performing a direct closure with continuous suture. A comparison to 191 patients that required laparotomy for abdominal injuries other than TID revealed significantly higher rates of concomitant injuries to several abdominal organs among patients suffering from TID. Compared to all other severely injured patients treated in the same period (n = 1377), patients suffering from TID had a significantly higher median ISS and a longer mean duration of hospital stay. Conclusions: Our findings show that TID can be seen as an indicator of particularly severe thoracoabdominal trauma that requires increased attention from the treatment team so as not to miss relevant concomitant injuries that require immediate intervention."

    "abstract": "Background: In geriatric trauma patients, higher mortality rate is observed compared to younger patients. A significant portion of trauma sustained by this age group comes from low-energy mechanisms (fall from standing or sitting). We sought to investigate the outcome of these patients and identify factors associated with mortality. Methods: A retrospective review of 1285 geriatric trauma patients who came to our level 1 trauma center for trauma activation (hospital alert to mobilize surgical trauma service, emergency department trauma team, nursing, and ancillary staff for highest level of critical care) after sustaining low-energy blunt trauma over a 1-year period. IRB approval was obtained, data collected included demographics, vital signs, laboratory data, injuries sustained, length of stay and outcomes. Patients were divided into three age categories: 65−74, 75−84 and >85. Comorbidities collected included a history of chronic renal failure, COPD, Hypertension and Myocardial Infarction. Results: 1285 geriatric patients (age > 65 years) presented to our level 1 trauma center for trauma activation with a low-energy blunt trauma during the study period; 34.8% of the patients were men, 20.5% had at least one comorbidity, and 89.6% were white. Median LOS was 5 days; 37 (2.9%) patients died. Age of 85 and over (OR 3.44 with 95% CI 1.01−11.7 and 2.85 with 95% CI 1.0−6.76, when compared to 65−74 and 75−84, respectively), injury severity score (ISS) (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15) and the presence of more than one comorbidity (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.26 to 5.68) were independently predictive of death on multi-variable logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: Age more than 85 years, higher injury severity score and the presence of more than one comorbidity are independent predictors of mortality among geriatric patients presenting with low-energy blunt trauma."

    "abstract": "Pericarditis is rare in Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection and only a few cases were reported in children. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy with symptoms of high fever and worsening chest pain during COVID-19 infection. Chest computer tomography (CT) and echocardiography confirmed pericardial tamponade requiring urgent drainage. Despite antiviral drug treatment, after 18 days severe attack developed requiring repeated pericardiocentesis. High dose ibuprofen, colchicin and the interleukin-1 antagonist, anakinra were given. Clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters improved after seven days of treatment. Autoinflammatory diseases were also suspected in the background the severe pericarditis, but genetic analysis ruled out any mutations. Pericarditis associated with COVID-19 infection may present in the acute phase or later as MIS-C. Though pericardial tamponade related to ongoing Covid-19 infection is rare in children, even biological treatment with interleukin-1 antagonist may be needed to control the inflammation."

    "title": "Laryngeal Trauma, Its Types, and Management.",
    "abstract": "Laryngotracheal wounds are rare; however, they have a significant mortality rate. These wounds can be blunt or penetrating. Usually, the larynx is protected from blunt trauma by the sternum and jaw. A \"clothesline\" injury happens when the exposed neck is struck by a hard object, such as a wall wire or tree branch, or when an attack is intended to damage the larynx. Additionally, injuries may occur when the neck is stressed due to damage, such as in a rear-end accident that causes a whiplash-like injury or when the larynx is intentionally targeted for harm. Penetrating neck trauma may result in injury to the larynx. Assume a patient has suffered a penetrating or severe neck injury. It is usually evident from their medical history or a quick trauma evaluation in that case. However, it is recommended to be cautious for anterior neck injuries in general and to have a low threshold for establishing a surgical airway. The priority is securing an airway when a patient with a laryngeal injury arrives in the emergency room. The operating surgeon may request any flexible laryngoscopy, computed tomography (CT), esophagram, and chest X-ray for additional examination, depending on the nature of the damage and the patient's health. After the examination, the initial step in treating laryngeal injuries should be to locate and secure the airway. According to the evaluation and management based on the Schaefer classification system for laryngeal injury, the patient is treated based on whether the patient has impending airway obstruction or a stable airway. Medical management or observation and surgical management depend on the site and severity of the injury, patient condition, and type of injury. There are several complications related to laryngotracheal trauma, which can be minor or even fatal. Following successful treatment, postoperative and rehabilitative care, vocal rest, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy may be necessary."

    "abstract": "Purulent pericarditis is an extremely rare entity with only a few reported cases so far. This condition deserves prompt diagnosis because of its significant mortality rate if left untreated. A 76-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right circumflex artery (RCA), ischemic cardiomyopathy with moderately reduced ejection fraction (EF 45-50%), peripheral artery disease (PAD), COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by fibrotic lung disease (on 3 liters of home oxygen), type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III presented with complaints of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. On hospital day 1, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with physical exam remarkable for bibasilar crackles and dry gangrene of his right first toe. He developed progressive altered mental status, hypotension, oliguric renal failure, and respiratory distress on hospital day 6. On exam at this time, he had an elevated jugular venous distension (JVD) of 12-14 cm water, pericardial friction rub with decreased heart sounds, and orthopnea; all were consistent with cardiac tamponade clinically. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed new ST elevations in leads I, II, and aVL with ST depression in aVR and V1 with only mild elevation in troponin I to 0.07 ng/mL. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done on hospital day 7 and showed a moderate sized pericardial effusion with inferior vena cava (IVC) enlargement but no atrial collapse, ventricular collapse, IVC collapse, or respiratory variation in the mitral and tricuspid inflow velocities. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on hospital day 6, and he was started on intravenous (IV) vancomycin. The differential diagnosis for his enlarging pericardial effusion included purulent pericarditis, uremic pericarditis, or hemorrhagic effusion. He had urgent diagnostic and therapeutic pericardiocentesis with removal of 350 milliliters of fluid. The pericardial fluid was cloudy, tan-brown with a gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in clusters and cultures growing MRSA, which confirmed the diagnosis of purulent pericarditis secondary to MRSA infection. After the pericardiocentesis, his blood pressure, respiratory distress, and renal failure improved. The source of the bacteremia was from osteomyelitis of his gangrenous, right toe with bone biopsy growing both MRSA and Streptococcus anginosus. He underwent toe amputation for definitive source control. He was discharged on hospital day 24 with a plan to complete 6 weeks of IV vancomycin."

    "abstract": "Mental health is recognized as an important outcome in major trauma survivors. There are limited data on how and when survivors access mental health services. Our objectives were to determine the frequency, timing, and factors associated with outpatient mental health service utilization in major trauma survivors. We conducted a population-based cohort study using linked administrative data on patients treated for major trauma in Ontario between 2009 and 2017. All trauma survivors were included in the cohort, and composite rates of outpatient mental health service use (family doctor, psychiatrist, or emergency department visits) were compared in the 3 years preinjury and postinjury. We used an exposure crossover study design and negative binomial regression with generalized estimating equations for the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify patient characteristics associated with mental health service use during the follow-up period. There were 37,260 patients included in the cohort, predominantly men (70.8%) from urban areas (84.8%) suffering blunt trauma (89.7%). Among the patients, 47.4% used mental health services during the preinjury period and 61.8% during the postinjury period (absolute increase of 14.4%). Compared with the 3 years preinjury, the rate of mental health service use increased by 80% (rate ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.75-1.77) in the 3 years following injury. Most survivors (62.2%) used services within the first year following discharge. Postinjury mental health service use (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-3.7) was most strongly associated with preinjury mental health service use. Preinjury and postinjury outpatient mental health service use is common in trauma patients, with preinjury service use predictive of ongoing service use. Mental health concerns should be an expected outcome of major trauma and efforts made to implement and expand access to services for injury survivors across trauma systems.

    "abstract": "Acquired diaphragmatic hernia (ADH) is a rare complication after liver surgery in adult and pediatric patients. In the literature, a few low case series have been reported. Its incidence is estimated to be between 0.74% and 2.9%. Main descriptions of ADH concern liver resection for tumors, living donor hepatic donation in adult patients, and partial liver graft transplant in children [1,2]. We encountered a rare case of ADH in the postoperative time of a liver transplant with thrombosis of hepatic artery due to median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS). The patient was a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with symptomatic hepatorenal polycystic disease who underwent a liver transplant with an isogroup graft from a cardiac-dead donor. During the first postoperative day, the rutinary color Doppler ultrasonography showed absent artery hepatic flow, and angiography suggested thrombosis of the hepatic artery (HA). With these findings, exploratory laparotomy was done. We performed thrombectomy and liberation of the celiac artery from the median arcuate ligament by dividing its fibers. At discharge, the liver function was normal, and Doppler showed good blood flow in the HA. At fourth postoperative month, she presented in the urgency unit with upper abdominal pain and vomiting. Radiologic and endoscopic evaluation revealed an incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia and signs of gastric ischemia. After emergency laparotomy and evaluation of the left hemithorax, we performed hernial sac reduction with recovery of gastric hypoperfusion. The diaphragmatic hernia was repaired. Diaphragmatic hernia is a rarely reported complication of liver transplant and should be considered a potential late complication [1]."

Intestinal perforations with MAP is associated with high mortality rate and ambiguous treatment outcomes. Here we report a missed-opportunity case of Degos disease characterized by generalized skin eruption and multiple intestinal perforations. Definite diagnosis of Degos disease was finally concluded after two exploratory laparotomy operations and skin biopsies. Due to the delayed diagnosis and treatment, the patient died after being discharged automatically in spite of application of aspirin and low-dose subcutaneous heparin. In view of such circumstances, we searched the Pubmed using \"Degos [Title] OR Malignant Atrophic Papulosis [Title]\" AND \"perforation [Title] OR perforations [Title]\" and make a detailed analysis of the result. Degos disease is a rare systemic obstructive vascular disease with unknown pathologic mechanism and unavailable treatment methods. Diagnosis is usually based on the presence of pathognomonic skin lesions and tissue biopsy. Gastrointestinal involvement can cause serious and lethal conditions with high mortality. Currently, how to achieve a satisfying prognosis of MAP with intestinal perforations becomes the most urgent problem in front of medical staff."

We describe a patient with Valentino's syndrome in whom preoperative and intraoperative diagnoses were challenging due to misleading clinical, investigative, and morphological findings. A 31-year-old woman who was on methylprednisolone for sensory radiculopathy presented to the emergency department with acute right lower quadrant pain. The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis was supported by the elevated inflammatory markers and ultrasonographic findings. An appendicectomy and an ovarian cystectomy were performed due to the findings of mild appendicitis and right ovarian endometrioma, respectively. Postoperatively, she developed peritonitis with a purulent bile-stained discharge from the surgical site and per vagina. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen showed a retroperitoneal collection at the second lumbar vertebral level extending along the right paracolic gutter to the pelvis and intraperitoneal fluid collections in right lower quadrant and pelvis. An emergency exploratory laparotomy confirmed a perforation at the posterior aspect of the duodenum which was repaired with an omental patch. Unfortunately, relaparotomy and end ileostomy were required due to colonic perforation with the eroded drain tube. She made an uneventful recovery with intensive care and underwent ileostomy reversal after 12 weeks. We emphasize the clues to have a high degree of suspicion during preoperative and intraoperative evaluation to recognize this lethal mimicker of acute appendicitis."

Despite five endoscopic procedures aimed at achieving haemostasis, including placement of an over-the-scope clip, and four endovascular embolisations (inferior and superior pancreaticoduodenal, right gastroepiploic and gastroduodenal arteries), the patient continued to experience episodic, haemodynamically significant bleeding. He eventually required emergency exploratory laparotomy, where the proper hepatic artery was identified as the source (a previously unreported phenomenon). He underwent antrectomy and proper hepatic artery ligation. This case highlights the need to interrogate all portions of the hepatic vasculature in the treatment of refractory GI bleeding."

Moreover, literature surrounding psoas muscle hematoma formation as a consequence of penetrating abdominal injury is scarce. We report a case of psoas abscess formation following the development of psoas hematoma in a patient who suffered from a penetrating abdominal injury. A 40-year-old Indian male presented to the Emergency department with multiple abdominal cut and stab wounds as a result of physical assault. A computed tomography scan revealed injuries to the ascending colon along with hemoperitoneum and right psoas muscle hematoma. Exploratory laparotomy was performed in which a right hemicolectomy and a right psoas muscle evacuation were successfully achieved along with multiple drainage tubes placed. Six days later, a peritoneal fluid culture tested positive, and a computed tomography scan revealed right psoas muscle collection which was diagnosed as an abscess. Treatment of the abscess included antibiotics and ultrasound-guided drainage. Patient was eventually discharged but was lost to follow-up. The development of iliopsoas abscess and hematoma as a consequence of abdominal penetrating injuries is a rare occurrence. Diagnosis can be made by computed tomography imaging and examination of the drained fluid. Managing a case with both of these rare phenomena can be challenging due to the scarce literature highlighting and comparing the different management modalities."

Our patient refused hospitalization; therefore, both ciprofloxacin and clindamycin were registered for a total of 19 days. No complications were experienced, and he recovered fully. In our case, the thorough cleaning of the ulcer bed prior to sample collection, the fact that it was the only microorganism isolated, and the wound's aggravating mechanism led the authors of the present study to the conclusion that B. simplex was the most probable culprit of the infection. To our knowledge, this is the second probable case of B. simplex infection described worldwide, and the first in Greece."

Prospective observational clinical study from 2013 to 2015. Private veterinary referral and emergency center. Forty-four client-owned dogs hospitalized following blunt trauma. Within 1 hour of presentation and prior to fluid administration an initial hematocrit, total plasma protein, blood glucose, plasma lactate, blood gas, and electrolytes were obtained for analysis. Plasma lactate concentrations were also measured 4 and 8 hours following initial measurement, and a 4-hour lactate clearance was calculated if patients had an increased admission plasma lactate. ATT score and SI were calculated for each patient based on admission data. Outcome was defined as survival to hospital discharge. Twenty-nine dogs survived, 14 were euthanized, and 1 died. Nonsurviving dogs had a lower mean pH (7.28 ± 0.03 vs 7.36 ± 0.01, P = 0.006), lower median HCO3 (15.7 vs 18.8 mmol/L, P = 0.004), lower median admission BE (-11.0 vs -7.0 mmol/L, P = 0.004), and higher median admission lactate (3.1 vs 2.4 mmol/L, P = 0.036) than those who survived. Median ATT was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (5 vsF 2, P < 0.001). The SI was not significantly different between survivors and nonsurvivors (P = 0.41). There was no difference in median 4-hour lactate (P = 0.34), median 8-hour lactate (P = 0.19), or 4-hour lactate clearance (P = 0.83) in survivors compared to nonsurvivors. No other statistically significant differences were noted between groups. Dogs hospitalized following blunt trauma with a lower admission pH, HCO3 , and BE and a higher admission plasma lactate were less likely to survive to hospital discharge. Median ATT score was also significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Although lactate clearance was not predictive of survival, the sample size was small, and additional studies with a larger study population are warranted."

This leads to unnecessary radiation exposure. The aim of this study is to review a level 1 ATC's use of CSCT in the adolescent blunt trauma population. A retrospective chart review was conducted of a level 1 ATC's trauma database. Blunt trauma patients between the ages of 11 and 18 who receive a CSCT between January 2015 to December 2019 were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of positive findings on CSCT scans. Data were analyzed using Fischer-Exact analysis and multivariate logistic regression where appropriate. Three-hundred thirty-seven of 546 (61.7%) adolescent blunt trauma patients received CSCT. Of those, 68.2% (230) were male; the mean age was 16.6 ± 1.0 y old. Twenty-eight patients (8.3%) had a positive finding on CSCT. All patients with a positive CSCT failed the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization study (NEXUS) criteria while 123 patients (36.5%) with a negative CSCT met NEXUS criteria. CSCT was overutilized in our trauma center. There is a low positive CSCT scan rate among adolescent patients, which aligns with the current literature. All patients with positive CSCT passed NEXUS criteria suggesting that a quality improvement project focusing on the use of the NEXUS criteria to assess the risk of cervical spine injury could potentially reduce the use of CSCT scans by nearly 40%."

    "abstract": "Maternal deaths from uterine rupture continue to occur globally, with particularly high rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal death reviews have been shown to be an effective part of cohesive strategies to prevent future deaths. This study aimed to conduct maternal death reviews for all deaths following uterine rupture in the study center, to assess preventability, and to synthesize key learning points that may help to prevent future maternal deaths following uterine rupture. Thorough case reviews of all maternal deaths from 2016 to 2018 at the study center (a national referral hospital in urban Uganda) were conducted by trained multidisciplinary panels of obstetricians and midwives. Medical records of women who died following uterine rupture (n=37, 10.6% of all maternal deaths) were extracted for further analysis. Most maternal deaths due to uterine rupture (36/37, 97%) were preventable, with most having been still potentially preventable after the women reached the study center (24/36, 67%). Obstructed labor was the leading cause of uterine rupture, accounting for 73% (27/37) of cases. Previous cesarean delivery was confirmed in 38% (14/37) of cases. The incidence of grand multiparity was 11% (4/37), and 11% (4/37) were primiparous. Most women (28/37, 76%) died within 24 hours of admission. On arrival at the study center, 19 (51%) were critically ill. Exploratory laparotomy was performed in 54% (20/37) of cases, and a further 35% (13/37) died while awaiting laparotomy. Four women died shortly after arrival at the study center (within 1 hour) and received basic resuscitative treatment; 27% (10/37) of women who died had received antenatal planning or preparation. Most deaths due to uterine rupture were preventable. The key lessons that emerged from the reviews were: (1) careful birth preparation and complication awareness for women with known risk factors, (2) early recognition of obstructed labor, (3) close monitoring of obstetrical interventions known to be associated with uterine rupture, and (4) treating incipient or suspected uterine rupture as a time-critical obstetrical emergency. The recommendations emerging from our narrative reviews are suitable for implementation in low-resource obstetrical settings, where high numbers of deaths involving uterine rupture occur."

Epidemiological data knowledge may help to provide them appropriate management. Only two epidemiologic studies about high-energy PRI were published during last decade. This study aimed to determine the gender-specific and global incidences of high-energy blunt AO/OTA type B or C PRI and their frequency among high-energy blunt trauma. It further reports the spectrum of these injuries and compares their characteristics and outcomes to high-energy blunt trauma without type B or C PRI. Type B or C PRI incidence isn't gender specific and approximates 5/100,000/year. A prospective database of a level-I trauma center serving approximately 500,000 inhabitants was retrospectively queried for all high-energy trauma patients injured between 01.01.2014 and 12.31.2016. Inclusion criteria were: alive emergency department delivery; entire acute treatment at the authors' institution; age >16. Exclusion criteria were: penetrating, blast, burn and electrical injuries; drownings; low-energy trauma; patients living outside the institution's catchment area. Three authors performed PRI classifications. Clinical data were extracted from the database. We analyzed 434 patients. High-energy blunt type B or C PRI incidence was 3.8/100,000/year without gender disparity (p=0.6697). High-energy blunt trauma incidence was lower in women than in men (20.5 vs. 51.6/100,000/year, p<0.001). Type B or C PRI frequency during high-energy blunt trauma was higher in women than in men (17.6% vs. 7.9%, p=0.003). Type B or C PRI patients were more severely injured and needed more treatment resources than other high-energy blunt trauma patients but didn't present higher complication or death rates. The incidence of high-energy blunt type B or C PRI was comparable to previously published data. Women were less likely to sustain a high-energy blunt trauma, but when they sustained one, they were more likely to have a type B or C PRI. Despite higher injury severity score and resource requirements, complication and death rates weren't different between type B or C PRI patients and other high-energy blunt trauma patients.

    "abstract": "Fetal intestinal volvulus without malrotation is extremely rare, and early prenatal diagnosis is challenging because the signs and symptoms are non-specific. However, without proper management, it can cause massive bowel necrosis. A woman experienced a dilated fetal bowel at 34 weeks of pregnancy and noticed a decrease in fetal movements at 36 weeks; however, she did not visit a hospital. Her newborn developed severe abdominal distension and was diagnosed with neonatal abdominal compartment syndrome with respiratory distress immediately after emergency caesarean section at 36 weeks and 5 days of pregnancy. The neonate underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. This revealed a volvulus of the small bowel with extensive necrosis and no findings of congenital malrotation. While the patient required massive necrotic bowel resection, 80 cm of the small intestine was preserved. Fetal intestinal volvulus without malrotation can cause abdominal compartment syndrome with rapid respiratory distress. Therefore, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fetal intestinal dilatation. Volvulus exacerbation risk increases from 30 weeks of pregnancy to late preterm delivery. However, the time lag between the mother's awareness of decreased fetal movement and caesarean section makes early diagnosis challenging, resulting in a life-threatening condition for the neonate. When a fetal ultrasound examination shows intestinal dilatation between gestational week 30 and late preterm, the mother must be fully informed about the possibility that the foetus has intestinal volvulus and the potential risk of massive fetal intestinal necrosis."

    "abstract": "The guidelines stress the importance of cardiac surgery in the management of life-threatening complications arising from lead removal. To delineate the roles of the cardiac surgeon during transvenous lead extraction (TLE). 3207 patients (38.7% F), average age 65.7 years, underwent the extraction of PM/ICD leads using standard non-powered mechanical systems within the last 14 years. Procedural success 96.1%, clinical success 97.8%, procedure-related death 0.18%, major complications 1.9% (cardiac tamponade 1.2%, hemothorax 0.2%, tricuspid valve damage 0.3%, stroke and pulmonary embolism < 1%). The roles for cardiac surgery in TLE have been categorized into five areas: 1. Emergency cardiac surgery (1.18% of all patients), 2. Late surgical intervention (TLE-related tricuspid valve dysfunction) (0.44%), 3. Cardiac surgery complementing partially successful TLE (0.68%: removal of lead fragments), 4. Epicardial pacemaker implantation through sternotomy for the above-mentioned reasons (0.65%), 5. Delayed surgical intervention after TLE to place epicardial LV leads (0.53%). Additionally, surgical experience can help in prevention and treatment of wound infection after TLE. Emergency cardiac surgery (mainly due to severe bleeding) is still the most frequent reason for intervention (33.63% (38/113) of all surgical procedures). The other areas of surgical interventions in lead management are: cardiac surgery complementing partially successful TLE, repair or replacement of the malfunctioning tricuspid valve secondary to lead extraction and implantation of permanent epicardial pacing leads after sternotomy or epicardial left ventricle lead to optimize cardiac resynchronization. Experience of a single high-volume lead extraction center confirms the need for close collaboration between the cardiologist and the cardiac surgeon, whose role goes far beyond mere surgical standby."

    "abstract": "The Hybrid Emergency Room System (HERS) allows clinicians to perform life-saving procedures without having to transfer patients. Several studies have reported the effectiveness of the HERS in the treatment of blunt trauma patients. However, the use of a hybrid emergency room (ER) for the treatment of penetrating cardiac injuries, including impalement injuries, has not been reported. We present the case of a patient with cardiac impalement injury that was diagnosed via computed tomography (CT) and was managed via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the hybrid ER and via surgery in the operating room. A 55-year-old man was transferred to our hybrid ER due to a penetrating wood injury through the right thoracic region. The patient had unstable vital signs. A CT scan revealed a pericardial effusion, right lung contusion, and bilateral pneumothoraxes. There were no signs of hemothorax or aortic injury. Veno-arterial-ECMO was performed in preparation for surgery. The patient was then transferred to the operating room. Pericardiotomy and cardiac repair were performed, and the ECMO was discontinued postoperatively. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 without complications. The hybrid ER allows rapid CT examination without relocation. Thus, it facilitates the formation of a timely and effective treatment plan. This report documents the successful management of a cardiac impalement injury in the HERS."

    "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum is anatomically considered as a true diverticulum, with its embryological origins arising from a persistent omphalomesenteric duct. In adults, the disease is usually asymptomatic, often being accidentally diagnosed during imaging tests or surgery to treat other diseases, or due to further complications. We report the case of a 26-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room complaining of pain and abdominal distension for 3 days, progressing to cessation of the elimination of gas for 1 day together with nausea and vomiting. Since the cause of the obstruction was not clearly identified, the patient's clinical status did not improve with non-operative measures and laparoscopy was not available, an exploratory laparotomy was conducted. In the cavity inventory, an approximately 20 cm wide MD was found in the terminal ileum adhered to the distal portion of the anterior abdominal wall. MD is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, with an estimated prevalence of between 0.3 % and 2.9 % in the general population. The clinical picture is usually asymptomatic, with the diagnosis made either via imaging tests performed to investigate other diseases, or during surgery to treat complications. MD is the most common anomaly of the digestive tract, despite its low prevalence. It presents even rarer complications, including obstruction, digestive bleeding, or diverticulitis. It is important to consider the diverticulum as a diagnostic hypothesis in cases of obstruction without apparent causes, but it does not alter the initial management of the patient."

Physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) was dispatched, and after the HEMS physician performed thoracostomy and tracheal intubation to relieve the tension pneumothorax and hemorrhagic shock, her carotid artery became unpalpable. The physician then decided to perform prehospital resuscitative thoracotomy. Immediately after arriving at the hospital, an emergency laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings showed that a huge uterine fibroid had been avulsed from the uterine wall, and we performed temporary hemostasis by extraction of the avulsed tumor and application of packing to the pelvic cavity. She was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital 42 days after the operation. The injury mechanism in this case was considered a \"submarine effect.\" This was an extremely rare case in which the acute care surgeon and a gynecologist collaboratively employed a damage control strategy to deal with impending cardiac arrest."

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic aortic injury (BTAI) is a life-threatening pathology that most commonly occurs after traffic accidents or a fall from a considerable height. We report a rare case of traumatic double transection which included the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) and left carotid artery (LCA) following a motorcycle accident. A 52-year-old man was brought to our emergency room for blunt trauma. Urgent computed tomography (CT) indicated BCA and LCA transection. Two weeks after the BTAI, CT indicated an increase in the size of the BCA pseudoaneurysm, a newly developed LCA pseudoaneurysm, and a spread of hematoma. An emergency partial aortic arch replacement including BCA and LCA reconstruction was performed 17 days after the BTAI. The postoperative course was good, and he was discharged 12 days later. An open aortic repair appeared to be more suited in the present case because the aortic injury occurred in a branched lesion of the aortic arch. It was thought that complete stent graft coverage of the transection lesion would be difficult. Although coexisting multiple system injuries complicate aortic repair, there was a rapid enlargement of the BCA and LCA pseudoaneurysms. Therefore, strict management is needed even in the case of cervical artery injury."

    "abstract": "Diaphragmatic hernias can be congenital or acquired and are a protrusion of intra-abdominal contents through an abnormal opening in the diaphragm. Acquired defects are rare and occur secondary to direct penetrating injury or blunt abdominal trauma. This case review demonstrates two unconventional cases of large diaphragmatic hernias with viscero-abdominal disproportion in adults. Case 1 is a 27-year-old man with no prior medical or surgical history. He presented following a 24-h history of increasing shortness of breath and left-sided pleuritic chest pain, and no history of trauma. Chest X-ray demonstrated loops of bowel within the left hemithorax with displacement of the mediastinum to the right. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a large diaphragmatic defect causing herniation of most of his abdominal contents into the left hemithorax. He underwent emergency surgery, which confirmed the viscero-abdominal disproportion. He required an extended right hemicolectomy to reduce the volume of the abdominal comtents and laparostomy to reduce the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome and recurrence of the hernia. Case 2 is a 76-year-old man with significant medical comorbidities who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain. He had a history of traumatic right-sided chest injury as a child resulting in right-sided diaphragmatic paralysis. Chest X-ray demonstrated a large right-sided diaphragmatic hernia with abdominal viscera in the right thoracic cavity. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated both small and large bowel loops within the right hemithorax, compression of the right lung and displacement of the mediastinum to the left. The CT scan also demonstarted viscero-abdominal disproportion. Operative management was considered initially but following improvement with basic medical management and no further deterioration, a non-operative approach was adopted. Both cases illustrate atypical presentations of adults with diaphragmatic hernias. In an ideal scenario, these are repaired surgically. When the presumed diagnosis shows characteristics of a viscero-abdominal disproportion and surgery is pursued, the surgeon must consider that primary abdominal closure may not be possible and multiple operations may be necessary to correct the defect and achieve closure. Sacrifice of abdominal viscera may also be necessary to reduce the volume of abdominal contents."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous rupture of the iliac vein is a rare cause of retroperitoneal hematoma. A misdiagnosis may delay the treatment and consequently put the patient in a life-threatening emergency. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with hemorrhagic shock from bleeding caused by a large left retroperitoneal hematoma. She was successfully treated with an endovascular approach by using a double bare stent technique. An extensive review of the literature was conducted and a total 44 articles with 50 patients were identified. Among these patients, 88.2% were women, 94.1% presented with a left-sided rupture, and the mortality rate was 13.7%. Spontaneous iliac vein rupture was more likely to occur in the left side in female patients. Conservative treatment was an option in hemodynamically stable patients. Exploratory laparotomy and surgical iliac vein repair was necessitated in most patients. Endovascular treatment including placement of covered stent and coil embolization had been widely used to treat spontaneous vein rupture since 2003. Double bare stent technique was also an effective alternative if a suitable covered stent was unavailable."

CSA allows the anesthesiologist to titrate tiny doses of a local anesthetic to achieve the desired degree of spinal anesthesia. The duration can be extended to accommodate the demands of the protracted operation. Due to a lack of equipment and financial restraints, particularly in resource-constrained areas, and worries of neurologic consequences such as cauda equina syndrome, CSA is yet to acquire general acceptability among anesthesiologists. In terms of postoperative pain management, CSA can be comparable to epidural analgesia and is considered far superior to abdominal wall blocks when correctly applied. Here we discuss a case wherein a standard epidural catheter in subarachnoid space was used to successfully perform an emergency exploratory laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Modifiable risk factors associated with procedure-related 30-day readmission after emergency general surgery (EGS) have not been comprehensively studied. We set out to determine risk factors associated with EGS procedure-related 30-day unplanned readmissions. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database (2013-2019). It included nine surgical procedures encompassing 80% of the burden of EGS diseases, performed on an urgent/emergent basis. The procedures were classified as low risk (open and laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and high risk (open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic and open colectomy, lysis of adhesions, perforated ulcer repair, small bowel resection, and exploratory laparotomy). Data on patient characteristics, admission status, procedure risk, hospital length of stay, and discharge disposition were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. A total of 312,862 patients were included (16,306 procedure-related 30-day readmissions [5.2%]). Thirty-day readmission patients were older, had higher American Association of Anesthesiology scores, were more often underweighted or markedly obese, and were more frequently presented with sepsis. Risk factors associated with EGS procedure-related 30-day unplanned readmissions included age older than 40 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.15), American Association of Anesthesiology ≥3 (AOR, 1.41), sepsis present at the time of surgery (AOR, 1.84), body mass index <18 kg/m 2 (AOR, 1.16), body mass index ≥40 kg/m 2 (AOR, 1.12), high-risk procedures (AOR, 1.51), LOS ≥4 d (AOR, 2.04), and discharge except to home (AOR, 1.33). Thirty-day readmissions following low-risk procedures occurred at a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 2-11 days) and 6 days (interquartile range, 3-11 days) after high-risk procedures. Surgical site infections, postoperative sepsis, wound disruption, and thromboembolic events were more prevalent in the 30-day readmission group. Mortality rate was fourfold higher in the 30-day readmission group (2.4% vs. 0.6%). We identified several unmodifiable patients and EGS disease-related factors associated with 30-day unplanned readmissions. Readmissions could be potentially reduced by the implementation of a postdischarge surveillance systems between hospitals and postdischarge destination facilities, leveraging telehealth and outpatient care.

In this case presentation we study the treatment of a gastrointestinal fistula between the transverse colon and the stomach in a patient with Crohn's disease and present a review of the available literature. A 53-year-old female patient with history of Crohn's disease presented to the Emergency Department of our Hospital due to reported abdominal pain and clinical symptoms of incomplete ileus with no other specific symptoms. Imaging investigation included plain radiography and computed tomography of the abdomen and revealed mural thickening of the transverse colon for an approximately 10 cm long segment, with the possible presence of gastrocolic fistula. During the exploratory laparotomy, an inflammatory mass was found in the middle of the transverse colon and the communication with the stomach was confirmed. Excision of the affected part of the transverse colon and cuneiform resection of the stomach in the area of the fistula was performed. The patient presented smooth and uncomplicated postoperative period and was discharged on the 10th postoperative day. Gastrointestinal fistulas are an uncommon complication of Crohn's disease, often with an intense clinical manifestation from the upper and lower digestive tract. Surgical treatment, either open or laparoscopic, of gastrointestinal fistulas due to Crohn's disease is the \"gold-standard\" method, both to control the disease and avoid further complications."

    "title": "Trends and Outcomes in Management of Thoracic Aortic Injury in Children, Adolescent, and Mature Pediatric Patients Using Data from the National Trauma Data Bank.",
    "abstract": "Thoracic aortic injury (TAI) is rare in the pediatric population. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the recommended standard of care for treatment in the adult population given its association with lower rates of mortality and morbidity than traditional open repairs for treatment of TAI. However, there are unique anatomic challenges in treating pediatric patients with TEVAR which may impact the outcomes and pediatric guidelines. We aimed to compare current management trends and outcomes between different pediatric age groups using data from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). We analyzed the NTDB from 2007 to 2019 using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and -10 codes to identify patients with a TAI. We excluded patients older than 21 years and any patients who died in the emergency department. The pediatric patients were stratified by age group: children (1-11 years), adolescent (12-17 years), and mature (18-21 years) patients. Patient characteristics compared included injury mechanism and severity, TAI intervention, and outcomes between the 3 groups using bivariate analysis (analysis of variance for parametric and Kruskal-Wallis for nonparametric variables). These characteristics and outcomes were also compared by TAI intervention and injury mechanism. ICD-9 and -10 procedural codes were used to identify patients who underwent TEVAR, open aortic repair (OAR), or both. The modified Poisson regression was performed with relative risk (RR) to evaluate our primary outcome measure-mortality during the trauma admission. A total of 2,431 pediatric TAI were identified in the NTDB that met the inclusion criteria. This included 134 children (5.5%), 733 adolescent (30.2%), and 1,564 mature (64.3%) patients. Children had significantly lower median Injury Severity Scores (34.1) than the adolescent (38) or mature population (36.1) (P = 0.001). The mechanism of injury differed between age groups. Children had higher rates of blunt trauma (90.3% children, 89.6% adolescent, and 86.8% mature patients) and mature patients had higher rates of penetrating trauma (6% children, 10.1% adolescent, and 12.5% mature patients) (P < 0.001). TAI management also differed significantly between pediatric age groups. Mature patients had significantly higher rates of TEVAR (3% children, 25.2% adolescent, and 29.2% mature patients) and children were most likely to be treated with nonoperative management (NOM) (94% children, 67.9% adolescent, and 64.8% mature patients) (P < 0.001). Patients who were treated with TEVAR were discharge home most frequently (31.8% NOM, 54.1% TEVAR, 44.3% OAR, 22.2% both TEVAR and OAR). Upon modified Poisson regression analysis, patient age was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Intervention with TEVAR (RR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.15-0.33, P < 0.001) and OAR (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.36-0.93, P = 0.024) were associated with a lower risk of mortality than NOM. TAI is less prevalent in children compared to adults. TEVAR for TAI is associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality compared to both NOM and OAR without differences between pediatric subgroups. Further studies should be completed to determine the most appropriate management guidelines."

To evaluate the association of early norepinephrine administration with 24-hour mortality among patients with blunt trauma and hemorrhagic shock. This retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study used data from 3 registries in the US and France on all consecutive patients with blunt trauma from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018. Patients were alive on admission with hemorrhagic shock, defined by prehospital or admission systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg and evidence of hemorrhage (ie, prehospital or resuscitation room transfusion of packed red blood cells, receipt of emergency treatment for hemorrhage control, transfusion of >10 units of packed red blood cells in the first 24 hours, or death from hemorrhage). Blunt trauma was defined as any exposure to nonpenetrating kinetic energy, collision, or deceleration. Statistical analysis was performed from January 15, 2021, to February 22, 2022. Continuous administration of norepinephrine in the prehospital environment or resuscitation room prior to hemorrhage control, according to European guidelines. The primary outcome was 24-hour mortality, and the secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The average treatment effect (ATE) of early norepinephrine administration on 24-hour mortality was estimated according to the Rubin causal model. Inverse propensity score weighting and the doubly robust approach with 5 distinct analytical strategies were used to determine the ATE. A total of 52 568 patients were screened for inclusion, and 2164 patients (1508 men [70%]; mean [SD] age, 46 [19] years; median Injury Severity Score, 29 [IQR, 17-36]) presented with acute hemorrhage and were included. A total of 1497 patients (69.1%) required emergency hemorrhage control, 128 (5.9%) received a prehospital transfusion of packed red blood cells, and 543 (25.0%) received a massive transfusion. Norepinephrine was administered to 1498 patients (69.2%). The 24-hour mortality rate was 17.8% (385 of 2164), and the in-hospital mortality rate was 35.6% (770 of 2164). None of the 5 analytical strategies suggested any statistically significant association between norepinephrine administration and 24-hour mortality, with ATEs ranging from -4.6 (95% CI, -11.9 to 2.7) to 2.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to 6.3), or between norepinephrine administration and in-hospital mortality, with ATEs ranging from -1.3 (95% CI, -9.5 to 6.9) to 5.3 (95% CI, -2.1 to 12.8). The findings of this study suggest that early norepinephrine infusion was not associated with 24-hour or in-hospital mortality among patients with blunt trauma and hemorrhagic shock. Randomized clinical trials that study the effect of early norepinephrine administration among patients with trauma and hypotension are warranted to further assess whether norepinephrine is safe for patients with hemorrhagic shock."

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous emphysema (SCE) of the head, neck and mediastinum most commonly arises due to penetrating trauma and iatrogenic events facilitating air entry into these spaces [1]. Spontaneous SCE can emerge due to a pressure gradient between the intra-alveolar air and surrounding structures, causing alveolar rupture and dissection of the peribronchovascular sheath. This is known as the Macklin effect. Potential consequences include pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, facial emphysema and pneumoracchis [1]. We aim to describe a case of SCE in a 21-year-old female presenting to the emergency department (ED) after weight training. A 21-year-old female presented to the ED with a sore throat and dysphagia after weight lifting in the gym 6 h earlier. Training involved repeat Valsalva manoeuvres. She experienced sharp pain with onset over an hour, worse with swallowing. She had a history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Vital signs, local examination and systemic examination were unremarkable. The diagnosis was made with soft tissue neck X-ray, demonstrating emphysema within the prevertebral space extending from the skull base to the first thoracic vertebra (Fig. 1). Her chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. No intervention was required beyond analgesia, and she was discharged from the ED. She was advised to avoid heavy lifting and diving. A follow-up radiograph showed resolution of the SCE. This case is an important rare entity and highlights for clinicians that pain after physical exercise may involve injuries extending beyond the area directly trained."

    "abstract": "High-energy blunt pelvic ring injuries with hemodynamic instability are complicated by a high mortality rate (up to 32%). There is no consensus on the best management strategy for these injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the high-energy blunt pelvic ring injury management protocol implemented in the authors' institution. This retrospective cohort study was performed in an academic level I trauma center. The institutional protocol incorporates urgent pelvic mechanical stabilization of hemodynamically unstable patients not responding to a pelvic belt, fluids, and transfusions. If hemodynamic instability persists, angiography ± embolization is performed. Adult patients sustaining a high-energy blunt pelvic ring injury between 2014.01.01 and 2019.12.31 were included in the study. The primary outcome was mortality at 1, 2, 30 and 60 days. The secondary outcomes were the number of packed red blood cell units transfused during the first 24 h, intensive care unit stay, and total hospitalization length of stay. 192 high-energy blunt pelvic ring injury patients were analyzed. Of these, 71 (37%) were hemodynamically unstable, and 121 (63%) were stable. The overall in-hospital mortality of the hemodynamically unstable and stable groups was 20/71 (28.2%) and 4/121 (3.3%) respectively (p<0.001). Cumulative mortality rates for hemodynamically unstable patients were 15.5% at day 1, 16.9% at day 2, 26.8% at day 30 and 28.2% at day 60, and for hemodynamically stable patients, rates were 0% at day 1 and 2, 2.5% at day 30 and 3.3% at day 60. Unstable patients required a higher number of packed red blood cell units than stable patients during the first 24 h (5.1 vs. 0.1; p<0.001). Intensive care unit length of stay and total hospitalization duration was 11.25 and 37.4 days for unstable patients and 1.9 and 20.9 days for stable patients (p<0.001). For both hemodynamically unstable and stable patients, the institutional protocol showed favorable mortality rates when compared to available literature. Comparative studies are needed to determine the management strategies with the best clinical outcome and survival."

    "abstract": "Background: Internal mammary artery pseudoaneurysms most commonly develop from thoracic penetrating trauma or procedures. However, other important etiologies should not be overlooked. Case Report: A 27-year-old female presented with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and epilepsy. On admission, the patient had pulseless electrical activity and hypertensive emergency. After the patient was successfully resuscitated, she developed status epilepticus. Laboratory workup on admission revealed a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio, elevated C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate, and acute anemia. Imaging showed a right-sided subdural hematoma with a midline shift and likely internal mammary artery pseudoaneurysm. Angiography demonstrated aneurysmal dilation, segmental narrowing, and a string of beads appearance. Because of our patient's demographics, string of beads appearance on diagnostic angiography, history of renal disease, and negative hepatitis serology, fibromuscular dysplasia was considered the etiology of the internal mammary artery pseudoaneurysm. The family opted for 2 burr holes and a subdural drain but declined further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions because of anoxic brain injury and poor prognosis. Conclusion: In this patient, the etiology of the internal mammary artery pseudoaneurysm was attributed to fibromuscular dysplasia. Although this patient's family chose comfort measures, treatment methods are available for internal mammary artery pseudoaneurysms."

    "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is considered one of the most common surgical emergencies with low morbidity and mortality. However, delay in the diagnosis may lead to perforation of the appendix. Hence, complications may arise, including necrotizing fasciitis, a rare complication of a perforated appendix. We present a case of perforated appendicitis complicated by necrotizing fasciitis leading to rapid deterioration. A 75-year-old male patient presented to our emergency room with a three-day history of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and abdominal distention. On admission, computed tomography (CT) scan showed a perforated appendix and peri-appendicular abscess. An exploratory laparotomy was performed. The appendix was resected and the wound closed. The patient was recovering well and tolerating food after the procedure. However, the patient developed progressive erythema/swelling over the right flank with new-onset leukocytosis. The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis was suspected and confirmed by careful evaluation and laboratory/radiological tests. Antibiotics were changed to clindamycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and the patient was taken back to the operation room (OR) for surgical debridement. Postoperatively, the patient was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU). He developed hearing impairment, which improved after the cessation of clindamycin. He was discharged in good condition after three weeks of hospital stay. This case report highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for necrotizing soft tissue infection in immunocompromised patients with perforated appendicitis and being cautious when prescribing clindamycin to patients at risk of hearing loss."

    "abstract": "The safety and effectiveness of prehospital clinical c-spine clearance or spinal motion restriction (SMR) decision support tools are unclear. The present study aimed to examine the available literature on clinical cervical spine clearance and selective SMR decision support tools to identify possible barriers to implementation, safety, and effectiveness when used by emergency medical service (EMS) practitioners. We performed a focused scoping review of published literature on the prehospital use of clinical c-spine clearance and SMR decision tools in adult blunt trauma patients. The Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, Turning Research into Practice and EBSCOhost online databases were searched (February 2021). The type of decision support tool and facilitators and barriers to its use were extracted from each included publication in accordance with a modified descriptive-analytical framework. Extracted data were subjected to thematic analysis. Following screening, forty-two articles were included in this scoping review. No studies conducted specifically in low resource settings were found. The majority of articles (57%) evaluated the use of specific SMR decision support tools, such as the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) and the Canadian C-spine Rule (CCR). Potential facilitators of safe and effective use were identified in 60%, and potential barriers to safe and effective use in 55% of included articles. Only one study evaluated the CCR when used by EMS practitioners, making it difficult to determine its appropriateness for implementation in the prehospital setting. This is the first scoping review, to our knowledge, that has attempted to identify the possible barriers and facilitators to their implementation, safety, and effectiveness when used by EMS practitioners. Key issues identified included terminology, guideline compliance and implementation, and a lack of context-specific evidence. These may provide important considerations for future guideline development."

    "abstract": "Unintentional eye injuries are common in small children. If left unobserved by parents or caretakers, it is challenging to assess as the kids are in distress and pain. Penetrating trauma in or near the eye requires urgent treatment as it can lead to infection and other complications. Early diagnosis and management help avoid further complications. An 11-month-old female was presented by her parents at a tertiary care clinic with inconsolable crying and swelling over the right eye's upper lid for one day. There was a history of possible trauma with a pen while the child was playing. During the examination, swelling in the right periorbital region between the eye and nasal bridge with the opening of the foreign body tract was noted. A skull X-ray with orbit showed a radiopaque nib of the pen in the right periorbital soft tissue. Emergency surgery was planned under general anesthesia. Surgery was performed and the pen was extracted from the right periorbital soft tissue lying between the eye and nasal bridge. Parents and health care providers, including pediatricians, should assess a crying child with a trauma history carefully even with no apparent clinical findings. Efforts must be done to correlate clinical findings with proper history and other needed investigations."

    "abstract": "Penetrating thoracic injury is a type of critical illness with a high mortality rate, which often involves the heart, large blood vessels, and lungs. Penetrating cardiac injury is a very serious condition, and most patients die rapidly within minutes due to hemorrhagic shock and acute cardiac tamponade. Due to the critical condition and rapid development of this type of injury, most patients die before reaching the hospital. It is rare in clinical practice and difficult to treat. Our hospital recently admitted a case of penetrating cardiac injury. In this case, a 50-year-old male was admitted to the hospital following \"a fall from a height [that] caused steel bar[s] to penetrate the chest cavity for 7 hours before he arrived at the hospital\". The patient fell from a height of 3meters at a construction site, which caused 2 steel bars to penetrate his chest. The patient presented with symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and apathy. Chest computed tomography suggested combined cardiopulmonary penetrating injury. Echocardiography suggested penetrating cardiac injury, and moderate pericardial effusion. After the patient was sent to the Emergency Department of our hospital, the relevant laboratory examinations and an emergency surgery were performed. The rescue team consisting of cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, anesthesiology, emergency department, and imaging department specified the treatment plan. Under general anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass was performed via right femoral arteriovenous cannulation. The steel bars were removed, the left atrial posterior wall and ventricular septal perforation were repaired, and the great cardiac vein was sutured. Coronary artery bypass surgery was performed at the same time, and the anterolateral lung tissue of the left lower lobe was resected. Postoperative treatment was given to prevent against infection and improve cardiopulmonary function. The patient recovered well, and he was discharged from the hospital. The results of the follow-up 1 year after surgery were normal. Timely treatment and a reasonable operation mode is essential in treating this kind of trauma. A joint diagnosis and treatment by a multidisciplinary team can enable a comprehensive assessment of the condition to be made quickly and an optimal treatment plan to be formulated."

Here, we evaluated the ability of a novel bedside ultrasound protocol (Tamponade/tension pneumothorax, Heart, Inferior vena cava, Respiratory system, Deep venous thrombosis/aorta dissection [THIRD]) to predict types of shock in the emergency department. An emergency physician performed the THIRD protocol on all patients with shock who were admitted to the emergency department. All patients were closely followed to determine their final clinical diagnoses. The kappa index, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for the initial diagnostic impression provided by the THIRD protocol, compared with each patient's final diagnosis. In total, 112 patients were enrolled in this study. The kappa index between initial impression and final diagnosis was 0.81 (95% confidence interval=0.73-0.89; P<0.001). For hypovolaemic, cardiogenic, distributive, and obstructive types of shock, the sensitivities of the THIRD protocol were 100%, 100%, 93%, and 100%, respectively; the sensitivity for a 'mixed' shock aetiology was 86%. The negative predictive value of the THIRD protocol for all five types of shock was ≥96%. Initial diagnostic judgements determined using the THIRD protocol showed favourable agreement with the final diagnosis in patients who presented with undifferentiated shock. The THIRD protocol has great potential for use as a bedside approach that can guide the rapid management of undifferentiated shock in emergency settings, particularly for patients with obstructive, hypovolaemic, or cardiogenic shock."

This retrospective observational study was conducted at the tertiary reference hospital. Consecutive patients aged 18 years and older treated for blunt thoracoabdominal trauma in the emergency department between August 2020 and February 2022 were included in the study. The ability of GPRs obtained from arterial blood gases and SI levels on admission to predict mortality and indication for surgery was evaluated by calculating areas under receiver operating characteristic curves Area under the curve (AUCs). A total of 102 patients, of which 91 in the survivor group and 11 in the non-survivor group, were analyzed. The AUCs for estimating mortality with GPR and SI were 0.854 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.742-0.967) and 0.809 (95%, 0.666-0.952), respectively.

    "abstract": "Objective evaluation of the severity of injured patients is crucial for the adequate triage, decision-making, operative and intensive care management, prevention, outcome studies and system quality assessment. This study aimed to compare six, widely- used, trauma scores as predictors of mortality, and to identify the most powerful among them in limited-resources settings. Seventy-five polytraumatized patients, admitted to the ICU of the Clinic for Emergency Surgery (Level 1 trauma center, CSS Belgrade) from June 2018-August 2020, were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were age≥16, ISS≥16 and SOFA≥5 points. Scores were evaluated using logistic regression model and analysis of areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). During the 26 months period, highly selected cases, mostly of blunt trauma (97.3%), due to a road traffic accident (68%) and free-falls (25.3%) were included. Surgery was indicated in 56 (74.7%) and non-operative treatment in 19 (25.3%) cases, with overall mortality rate at 36%. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that all six trauma scores (ISS, NISS, APACHE2, SOFA, TRISS, KTS) were significant mortality predictors (p<0.001). Observed cut-off values for ISS: 39.5, NISS: 42, APACHE 2: 25, SOFA 6.5 points are predictive for mortality in non-survivors. A multivariate analysis showed that the most powerful mortality predictors are TRISS and APACHE 2 with AUCs: 0.9 and 0.866. According to our study the most powerful mortality predictors are APACHE 2 and TRISS, even in limited-resources hospital settings, while statistically significant KTS, did not perform as expected. We propose the appliance of the KTS, as the tool for exploiting 'golden hour', ISS or NISS during admission stage and APACHE 2 or TRISS for use in the first 24 hours after admission to ICU."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST's) are rare tumours of the alimentary tract. They are often discovered incidentally during imaging or intra-operatively. In rare instances, they present acutely with life threatening gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding requiring emergency surgical intervention. A 47-year-old gentleman, who is an ex-smoker with normal body mass index (BMI), presented with acute onset of epigastric pain, dizziness, and multiple episodes of melaena. The patient deteriorated rapidly and urgent endoscopy revealed active retrograde bleeding from beyond the duodenojejunal junction. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) suggested a highly vascular ileal exophytic mass resembling a GIST. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was conducted where hemostasis was achieved via segmental enterectomy of the mass that was unexpectedly jejunal in origin. During recovery, he encountered post-operative complications that were managed conservatively and eventually was discharged with a referral to the national cancer centre. The clinical presentation of GIST is based on its size and location. Definitive diagnosis of GIST relies on histopathological findings although the clinical presentation and imaging, in particular CTA, can aid in its diagnosis. Management of GIST differs depending on the clinical presentation, size, location and whether metastasis is present. Surgical resection is the standard of treatment; however, Imatinib could be used for non-resectable tumours as well as in cases of recurrence, metastasis or as an adjuvant chemotherapy. It is important to acknowledge that small GISTs are often asymptomatic while larger ones may present with non-specific symptoms which can be misleading. This could potentially delay the diagnosis and thus treatment of GIST which can be detrimental in acute cases as illustrated here. It is important to have GIST as one of the differentials when faced with a patient presenting with non-specific GI symptoms."

A 76-year-old female presented post-fall with right-eye blunt trauma. She underwent canthotomy and cantholysis due to concern of orbital compartment syndrome in a regional hospital with emergency physicians clearing dark tissue near the lateral canthus at the time of canthotomy cantholysis. She had a traumatic expulsive iridodialysis with 360° loss of iris through the previous phacoemulsification wound in the clear cornea. The patient also had an orbital-floor fracture, which together with internal decompression through the previous phacoemulsification wound possibly prevented further damage to intraocular structures. There was good visual recovery. Herein, we propose that the combination of the orbital-floor fracture in tandem with the reopening of the previous phaco wound served as a decompressing mechanism to prevent further intraocular injury above that of total iridodialysis."

    "abstract": "In trauma patients, bleeding is an immediate major concern. At the same time, there are few cases of acute vascular occlusion after blunt trauma, and it is unclear what assessment and diagnosis should be considered for these cases. Herein, we describe a patient diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome after a hypercoagulable workup for acute renal and splenic vascular occlusion due to blunt trauma. A 20-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain after hitting a tree while riding a sled 10 h ago. He had no medical history. Radiological investigations revealed occlusion of the left renal artery with global infarction of the left kidney and occlusion of branches of the splenic artery with infarction of the central portion of the spleen. Attempted revascularization of the left renal artery occlusion through percutaneous transluminal angioplasty failed due to difficulty in passing the wire through the total occlusion. Considering the presence of acute multivascular occlusions in a young man with low cardiovascular risk, additional laboratory tests were performed to evaluate hypercoagulability. The results suggested a high possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome. Treatment with a subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin was started and changed to oral warfarin after two weeks. The diagnosis was confirmed, and he continued to visit the rheumatology outpatient clinic while taking warfarin. A hypercoagulable workup can be considered in trauma patients with acute multivascular occlusion, especially in young patients with low cardiovascular risk."

We present the case of a middle-aged hypertensive patient who had a history of unstable angina for seven days. He presented to the emergency room with chest pain, dyspnea, and unstable vital parameters. Clinical signs, electrocardiography, and echocardiography raised the suspicion of left ventricular free wall rupture with ST-segment elevation inferior wall and lateral wall MI. As a result, the patient received aggressive resuscitative measures. Later, he underwent surgical repair for cardiac rupture via cardiopulmonary bypass. Finally, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the 10th postoperative day. The window period from the onset of cardiac wall rupture to patient admission to the operating room is crucial. This case report highlights that a high index of suspicion for left ventricle free wall rupture should be considered for a patient presenting with MI and cardiogenic shock. Timely diagnosis and quick surgical intervention can deter complications and save the patient."

We report the first case of successful intrapericardial thrombus aspiration using a dedicated thrombus aspiration catheter in the early stage of pericardial thrombosis. A 76-year-old woman with non-valve atrial fibrillation underwent percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure for secondary prevention of stroke. A 24-mm Watchman device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance. Post-deployment angiography revealed LAA perforation, which led to the rapid onset of cardiac tamponade. Emergency pericardiocentesis was performed and the deep-seated device was redeployed at a more proximal position to seal the distal perforation. Pericardial bleeding was controlled after the drainage of 400 ml of blood. However, the patient re-developed cardiac tamponade following a period of stability. The patient was diagnosed with early-stage pericardial thrombosis based on echocardiographic findings of a hypoechoic effusion in the pericardial space. Thrombus aspiration using a pigtail catheter and long sheath failed; however, we performed successful intrapericardial thrombus aspiration using a dedicated thrombus aspiration catheter. We drained 120 ml of sludge-like blood, and the patient underwent successful conservative management without surgical intervention. This case report highlights the potential usefulness of a percutaneous intrapericardial thrombus aspiration technique using a dedicated thrombus aspiration catheter in selected patients with early-stage pericardial thrombosis, as a less invasive alternative to cardiac surgery."

If not rapidly diagnosed and managed, this condition can lead to sudden death. We describe the emergency handling procedures and rapid diagnostic methods for this critical emergency situation. We report a case of bilateral pneumothorax in a neonatal patient who underwent thoracoscopic esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula repair under the combined application of SLV and artificial pneumothorax. The patient suffered sudden cardiac arrest and received emergency treatment to revive her. The recognition of dangerous vital sign parameters, rapid evacuation of the artificial pneumothorax, and initiation of lateral position cardiopulmonary resuscitation while simultaneously removing the endotracheal tube to the main airway are critically important. Moreover, even though the sinus rhythm was restored, the patient's continued tachycardia, reduced pulse pressure, and depressed pulse oximeter waveform were worrisome. We should highly suspect the possibility of pneumothorax and use rapid diagnostic methods to make judgment calls. Sometimes thoracoscopy can be used for rapid examination; if the mediastinum is observed to be shifted to the right, it may indicate tension pneumothorax. This condition can be immediately relieved by needle thoracentesis, ultimately allowing the safe completion of the surgical procedure. Bilateral pneumothorax during SLV combined with artificial pneumothorax is rare but can occur at any time in neonatal thoracoscopic surgery. Therefore, anesthesiologists should consider this possibility, be alert, and address this rare but critical complication in a timely manner."

Symptoms and severity vary, ranging from asymptomatic to an imminent state of threatened cardiac arrest. This paper presents the etiology, initial work-up, and treatment of hemothorax, with an emphasis on massive hemothorax requiring an emergent thoracotomy for hemostasis. The etiology of hemothorax can be traumatic, iatrogenic, and non-traumatic/non-iatrogenic. Regardless of the etiology, the initial medical examination should be performed as in the initial trauma examination to evaluate the urgency, the amount of bleeding in the chest cavity, and the coexistence of pneumothorax. If massive hemothorax or tension pneumothorax is present, thoracic tube drainage should be started immediately. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) should be performed to identify the source of bleeding. Treatment includes fluid and blood transfusions to stabilize the circulation. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents should be neutralized, reduced, or withdrawn. Emergent thoracotomy for hemostasis is indicated for massive hemothorax with unstable circulation. Anterior-parasternal thoracotomy performed in the supine position has the advantage of rapid thoracotomy and good visualization. Endovascular therapy is effective when contrast-enhanced CT identifies the source of bleeding."

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic instability and hemorrhagic shock are frequently encountered by emergency medical services providers managing ill and injured patients during critical care transport. Although many critical care transport services commonly transfuse crystalloids and/or packed red blood cells (PRBCs), the administration of whole blood (WB) in prehospital care is currently limited. WB contains PRBCs, plasma, and platelets in a physiologic ratio to aid in oxygen delivery to tissue as well as hemostasis. This study describes a single critical care transport program's experience using WB for critically ill and injured patients and reports important clinical and safety outcomes. This study was a retrospective review of patients who were transported by a single rotor wing-based critical care transport service to 1 of 2 tertiary care receiving hospitals within a single health system. Patients who were transported between November 1, 2018, and November 30, 2019, and who received at least 1 unit of low-titer group O WB during critical care transport were included. The primary outcomes of interest included 24-hour mortality and the total 24-hour transfusion requirement. The safety outcomes included transfusion reactions, acute lung injury, acute kidney injury, and the incidence of venous thromboembolism. During the study period, there were 3,084 total patients transported by our critical care transport service. There were 71 patients who received prehospital WB, 64 of whom met the inclusion criteria. The top 3 indications for WB administration included blunt trauma (n = 27, 42.2%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (n = 15, 23.4%), and penetrating trauma (n = 11, 17.2%). The median total number of blood components transfused within 24 hours was 4.0 (interquartile range, 2.0-9.5), and the overall 24-hour mortality rate was 21.9%. The administration of WB by emergency medical services providers to critically ill and injured patients in the prehospital setting is feasible and is associated with low incidences of adverse events and transfusion reactions. Further research is needed to elucidate the benefits of WB relative to current prehospital standards of care."

    "abstract": "When evaluating trauma patients, many centers perform computed tomography of the head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, the so-called \"pan-scan.\" Here, we evaluate the utility of physical exam against pan-scan in geriatric patients who sustained ground-level falls. We performed a single-centered retrospective cohort review of consecutive patients from the trauma registry of a large, urban Level 1 trauma center. Inclusion criteria were registration during the 2019 calendar year, age ≥65, mechanism of fall from either sitting or standing, and performance of \"pan-scan\" at time of assessment. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the physical exam for significant injuries were calculated. The effect of such injuries on disposition from the emergency department and hospital were determined. An initial query for patients age ≥65 yielded 1280 patients. After exclusion of patients who did not undergo pan-scan or who had GCS <14, 751 patients were included in analysis. Median age was 84 years old. 351 patients had at least one injury identified on pan-scan. Physical exam was determined to have a sensitivity of 0.69 when compared to pan-scan as a gold standard. Patients with injury identified on CT scan had significantly more admissions, mortalities, and ICU and OR requirements. Approximately half of all patients were found to have at least one injury on pan-scan. Physical examination was insensitive at identifying such injuries which ultimately altered patient management, disposition, and outcomes. Pan-scan is recommended in this vulnerable population."

Commonly missed critical actions included misdiagnosing the tension pneumothorax as mainstem intubation, bronchospasm, pulmonary thromboembolism, and anaphylaxis. Residents rated the feedback and debriefing as \"extremely useful\" or \"very useful.\" Time constraints limit the number of residents who can sit in the \"hot seat.\" The structure of the mannequin limits the ability to diagnose pneumothorax by auscultation and ultrasound. In the future, the scenarios may also be utilized to educate student anesthesiologist assistants and other non-physician anesthesia learners."

    "title": "Epidemiology of hand injuries that presented to a tertiary care facility in Germany: a study including 435 patients.",
    "abstract": "Hand injuries compose up to 30% of all injuries in emergency care. However, there is a lack of epidemiological data reflecting patient or accident-related variables, injury types, injured anatomical structures or trauma localization. The objective of this study is (1) to provide epidemiological information on hand injuries and their patterns and (2) to visualise the frequencies of affected areas of the hand in relation to the most common trauma mechanisms using color-coded heatmaps. This prospective single-center observational trial conducted at a surgical emergency department in Germany collected data of hand trauma patients using a standardized documentation form. Demographic data, trauma-related data, diagnostic and therapeutic measures were analyzed. Color-coded heatmaps were generated marking anatomic danger zones. 435 patients with a mean age of 39.5 were included. Most patients admitted on their own initiative (79%). Leisure and sport injuries were most frequent (75%). Digiti II-V were injured most commonly (43%), followed by metacarpals (19%) and the thumb (14%). Blunt trauma and cuts accounted for most injuries (74%). Hand-graphics depicted color-coded frequencies of the affected areas of the palmar and dorsal aspect of the hand for the most common types of injury, as well as the most frequent circumstances of accident. Elective surgery was recommended in 25% of cases, and hand surgical follow-up was proposed in over 50% of cases. The dorsal aspect of the hand including the 5th metacarpal, the radial wrist and thenar region, as well as the fingertips of Digiti II/III represent anatomic danger zones to injury of the hand. Due to the large variety of potentially injured structures, diagnosis and treatment is not trivial. Specific training is required for all surgical specialties in emergency care, to increase quality of diagnostic work-up and management of hand injuries."

    "abstract": "Tracheobronchial ruptures caused by blunt chest trauma are rarely encountered but may be life-threatening. It is even rarer when the rupture is in the right middle lobe bronchus. Here we present a case of incomplete laceration of the right middle lobe bronchus after blunt trauma, which could easily be overlooked because of the absence of obvious symptoms. A 58-year-old man suffered multiple traumas after being attacked by cattle, closed chest drainage was promptly performed in the local hospital for bilateral hemopneumothorax. Three days later, the patient was transferred to our center for urgent exploratory thoracic surgery due to persistent hemothorax. We did not diagnose bronchial injury even after a bedside emergency bronchoscopy due to the adherence of bloody secretions and sputum crusts. It was not until a repeat chest CT 4 days after the initial surgery that we suspected an incomplete right middle lobe bronchial laceration, which was confirmed by postoperative bronchoscopy. The patient eventually underwent right middle lobe lung resection for a deep and wide bronchial laceration and recovered well. Clinicians should be fully aware of the possibility of this condition after blunt chest trauma and make good use of CT and bronchoscopy to help with diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "A 51-year-old woman who had previously undergone left mastectomy for left breast cancer accompanied by multiple metastasis experienced worsening dyspnea. Physical and imaging assessments of the hemodynamics suggested cardiac tamponade, and emergency pericardiocentesis was successfully performed. However, immediately after the procedure, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and showed pulseless electrical activity. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography with continuous mechanical support demonstrated massive thrombi in both pulmonary arteries. An abrupt decrease in the central venous pressure and an increase in the venous return following pericardiocentesis might result in the migration of a deep venous thrombus and fatal acute pulmonary thromboembolism."

    "abstract": "Traumatic hemorrhage is the most common cause of preventable death in civilian and military trauma. Early identification of pediatric life-threatening hemorrhage is challenging. There is no accepted clinical critical administration threshold (CAT) in children for activating massive transfusion protocols. Children 0 to 17 years old who received any transfusion in the first 24 hours after injury between 2010 and 2019 were included. The type, volume, and time of administration for each product were recorded. The greatest volume of weight-adjusted products transfused within 1 hour was calculated. The cut point for the number of products that maximized sensitivity and specificity to predict in-hospital mortality, need for urgent surgery, and second life-threatening bleeding episode was determined using Youden's index. A binary variable (CAT+) was generated using this threshold for inclusion in a multivariable logistic regression model. In total, 287 patients were included. The median (interquartile range) age was 6 (2-14) years, 60% were males, 83% sustained blunt trauma, and the median (interquartile range) Injury Severity Score was 26 (17-35). The optimal cutoff to define CAT+ was >20 mL/kg of product; this optimized test characteristics for mortality (sensitivity, 70%; specificity, 77%), need for urgent hemorrhage control procedure (sensitivity, 65%; specificity, 74%). and second bleeding episode (sensitivity, 77%; specificity, 74%). There were 93 children (32%) who were CAT+. On multivariate regression, being CAT+ was associated with 3.4 increased odds of mortality (95% confidence interval, 1.67-6.89; p = 0.001) after controlling for age, hypotension, Injury Severity Score, and Glasgow Coma Scale. For every unit of product administered, there was a 10% increased risk of mortality (odds ratio, 1.1; p < 0.001). Transfusion of more than 20 mL/kg of any blood product within an hour should be used as a threshold for activating massive transfusion protocols in children. Children who meet this CAT are at high risk of mortality and need for interventions; this population may benefit from targeted, timely, and aggressive hemostatic resuscitation.

HPVG may be considered as a nonspecific sign of a significant abdominal disease, ranging from potentially lethal diseases to benign conditions. Computed tomography (CT) can detect both the presence of gas and the underlying pathology. I report a 60-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and a high lactate level in the blood test. Because of the unknown etiology for the elevated lactate, a CT scan of the abdomen was taken, which showed that he developed intra-and extra-hepatic portal venous gas as well as in the portomesentric-portosystemic collaterals without any signs of mesenteric ischemia. The patient was treated conservatively and the HPVG completely resolved after a few days. Overall, physicians must be aware that prognosis is related to the pathology itself and is not influenced by the presence of PVG. HPVG can be caused by several benign conditions that do not necessarily require urgent exploratory laparotomy."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then, the disease has spread globally, leading to the ongoing pandemic. It can cause severe respiratory illness; however, many cases of pericarditis have also been reported. This systematic review aims to recognize the clinical features of pericarditis and myopericarditis in COVID-19 patients. Google Scholar, Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies reporting \"Coronavirus\" or \"COVID\" and \"Peri-myocarditis,\" \"heart,\" or \"retrospective.\" Case reports and retrospective studies published from May 2020 to February 2021 were reviewed. In total, 33 studies on pericarditis, myopericarditis, and pericardial infusion were included in this review. COVID-19 pericarditis affected adult patients at any age. The incidence is more common in males, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. Chest pain (60%), fever (51%), and shortness of breath (51%) were the most reported symptoms, followed by cough (39%), fatigue (15%), myalgia (12%), and diarrhea (12%). Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, elevated D-dimer, erythrocyte rate, and C-reactive protein. Cardiac markers including troponin-1, troponin-T, and brain natriuretic peptide were elevated in most cases. Radiographic imaging of the chest were mostly normal, and only 31% of chest X-rays showed cardiomegaly and or bilateral infiltration. Electrocardiography (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with around 59% ST elevation and rarely PR depression or T wave inversion, while the predominant echocardiographic feature was pericardial effusion. Management with colchicine was favored in most cases, followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and interventional therapy was only needed when patient developed cardiac tamponade. The majority of the reviewed studies reported either recovery or no continued clinical deterioration. The prevalence of COVID-19-related cardiac diseases is high, and pericarditis is a known extrapulmonary manifestation. However, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are less prevalent and may require urgent intervention to prevent mortality. Pericarditis should be considered in patients with chest pain, ST elevation on ECG, a normal coronary angiogram, and COVID-19. We emphasize the importance of clinical examination, ECG, and echocardiogram for decision-making, and NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids are considered to be safe in the treatment of pericarditis/myopericarditis associated with COVID-19."

Although pericarditis and pericardial effusion are frequent cardiac manifestations of SLE, cardiac tamponade is rarely reported, especially as the initial manifestation of the disease. We describe a 38-year-old Nigerian lady who presented with three months of progressive dyspnea. She had intermittent fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, jugular vein distension, and muffled heart sounds. Echocardiography confirmed cardiac tamponade. The ANA, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Sm antibodies were positive. She had a high ESR and low levels of blood complements. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on the 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria. She was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, oral prednisolone, and hydroxychloroquine after undergoing an emergency echo-guided pericardiocentesis. She responded well to treatment, and she is currently being followed up on an outpatient basis. Clinicians should consider SLE as a differential when evaluating patients with pericardial effusion, as an accurate and timely diagnosis could be lifesaving."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade following hiatal hernia repair is a rare and potentially fatal complication most often associated with the use of mechanical fixation devices for hiatal mesh reinforcement. Only three cases have been reported with sutures alone, and none following robotic hiatal surgery. A 54-year-old patient underwent elective robotic hiatal hernia repair with Toupet fundoplication during which a sling suture was placed to elevate the left lateral segment of liver. No mesh or mechanical fixation devices were used. Eight hours postoperatively, the patient developed hemodynamic instability. Cardiac tamponade was diagnosed on bedside echocardiogram and the patient underwent emergent pericardiocentesis with subsequent stabilization. The remainder of the postoperative course was notable for pericarditis which was treated with aspirin and colchicine. While the use of suture-based liver retraction has the advantages of avoiding an additional port and potential collision between retractor holder and robot arms, it constitutes a novel risk factor for cardiac tamponade. Prompt diagnosis via bedside echocardiography is essential and may facilitate percutaneous rather than operative management. Suture-based liver retraction in minimally invasive foregut surgery should be used judiciously until further data is available. Surgeons should maintain a high index of suspicion for tamponade in the setting of postoperative hypotension after its use."

A total of 20,289 canine trauma patients with data entered in the VetCOT trauma registry from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 INTERVENTIONS: None. Data were obtained from the VetCOT database and included patient demographics, trauma type (blunt, penetrating, both), Animal Trauma Triage (ATT) score, modified Glasgow Coma Scale (mGCS), abdominal fluid score (AFS), loss of glide sign on thoracic focused assessment with sonography for trauma (TFAST), pleural effusion on TFAST, surgical procedure performed and in what location (emergency room vs operating room), and outcome. Data from 20,289 dogs were collected over a 30-month period. The most common type of trauma was penetrating (10,816, 53.3%), followed by blunt (8360, 41.2%) and then combined blunt and penetrating trauma (1113, 5.5%). Dogs suffering only penetrating trauma had a 96.5% survival rate, blunt trauma had an 89.5% survival rate, and combined trauma had an 86.3% survival rate. Dogs suffering from both types of trauma had higher ATT scores, lower mGCS scores, and were more likely to be admitted to the ICU. Trauma type, mGCS, and ATT score were found to be associated with survival. The present study highlights that dogs suffering from a combination of blunt and penetrating trauma are more likely to suffer moderate to severe injuries, have lower survival rates, and are more likely to be admitted to the ICU compared to dogs suffering from only blunt or penetrating trauma. Trauma type, mGCS, and ATT scores were found to be associated with survival in all groups."

This study aimed to explore the prognostic value of LVH in predicting postoperative outcomes in acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients. This was a single-central retrospectively designed study. One hundred and ninety-three ATAAD patients who underwent surgical repair at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2018 to November 2021 were enrolled. Patients were divided based on their left ventricular mass index (LVMI). We compared their baseline characteristics, perioperative data, and in-hospital outcome. Then nomogram models were developed based on logistic regression to predict the postoperative outcomes. LVH presented in 28.5% (55 in 193) patients. LVH group had a higher proportion of female patients compared with the non-LVH group (32.7% vs. 17.4%, P=0.03). Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac tamponade were more prevalent in patients with LVH. LVH group had a higher risk of postoperative composite major outcomes (CMO) and operative mortality. Based on multivariable logistic regression, LVH/LVMI, Penn classification, hyperlipidemia, emergency surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass duration were applied to develop nomogram models for predicting postoperative CMO. The area under curve was 0.825 (95% CI: 0.749-0.900) for Model LVH and 0.841 (95% CI: 0.776-0.905) for Model LVMI. Nomogram models for predicting postoperative cardiac were developed based on LVH/LVMI and cardiopulmonary bypass duration. The area under curves for the models involving LVH or LVMI were 0.782 (95% CI: 0.640-0.923) and 0.795 (95% CI: 0.643-0.947), respectively. LVH and increased LVMI was associated with increased risk of postoperative CMO and cardiac events in ATAAD patients. The nomogram models based on LVH or LVMI might help predict postoperative CMO. Future research would be necessary to investigate prognostic value of LVH for long-term outcomes in ATAAD patients."

    "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a highly prevalent public health issue with multiple adverse health effects. Radiologists are well suited to assessing a patient's likelihood of IPV. Recognition of common IPV injury mechanisms and resulting target and defensive injury patterns on imaging and understanding of differences between patients who have experienced IPV and those who have not with respect to use of imaging will aid radiologists in accurate IPV diagnosis. Target injuries often involve the face and neck as a result of blunt trauma or strangulation; defensive injuries often involve an extremity. Awareness of differences in injury patterns resulting from IPV-related and accidental trauma can aid radiologists in detecting a mismatch between the provided clinical history and imaging findings to support suspicion of IPV. Radiologists should consider all available current and prior imaging in assessing the likelihood of IPV; this process may be aided by machine learning methods. Even if correctly suspecting IPV on the basis of imaging, radiologists face challenges in acting on that suspicion, including appropriately documenting the findings, without compromising the patient's confidentiality and safety. However, through a multidisciplinary approach with appropriate support mechanisms, radiologists may serve as effective frontline physicians for raising suspicion of IPV."

After three days of pericardiocentasis drainage, TB treatment was started and she was discharged for outpatient flow up. Tuberculous pericarditis is a serious tuberculosis (TB) complication that can be difficult to diagnose and often goes undetected, leading to late complications such as constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade, which lead to increased mortality. This current case illustrates a young female patient presenting with isolated TB pericarditis complicated by cardiac tamponade. She had massive improvement following pericardiocentesis and anti-TB treatment. In Africa, tuberculous pericarditis should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any patient presenting with moderate to massive pericardial effusion. A high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB pericarditis, especially in patients without known risk factors."

    "abstract": "Trauma to the head and neck results in acute facial trauma and swelling, which may occlude the airway and result in fatal hypoxia. The management is the establishment of a definitive airway. This paper reviews our experience with this clinical scenario. A retrospective study was conducted over a seven-year period from December 2012 to January 2020 at a major trauma centre in South Africa on all adult trauma patients who required a surgical airway procedure (surgical cricothyroidotomy (SC) or surgical tracheostomy (ST)). From December 2012 to January 2020, 12243 trauma patients were admitted. Of those, 242 patients required a surgical airway: 98% (238/242) underwent ST and 2% (4/242) underwent SC. A total of 3271 patients sustained trauma predominantly confined to the face and neck. The mechanism was penetrating trauma in 1077 and blunt trauma in 2194. Total of 51 patients required an emergency airway for acute head and neck trauma. There were four SCs and 47 STs. Of the four SC, three were inserted secondary to multiple failed attempts at intubation and one was inserted directly into an open tracheal injury. All of these were performed in the resuscitation room. The 47 STs were performed under conscious sedation in the operating theatre. There were eight failed intubations in the 51 patients with head and neck trauma, and of those three required an emergency SC and five required an emergency ST. The use of cricothyroidotomy in modern trauma care in our environment appears to be very limited."

    "abstract": "COVID-19 infection is a complex multi-organ disease, including the cardiovascular system, which may present with myocarditis. A 42-year-old female presented to our ED with generalized weakness, myalgia, and epigastric pain. Laboratory workup showed a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An ECG showed sinus tachycardia with low voltage. A bedside echocardiogram showed a pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. An emergent pericardiocentesis was performed with immediate hemodynamic improvement. The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU), and colchicine and ibuprofen were started for pericarditis. Pericardial fluid bacterial and fungal cultures were negative, and serum antinuclear antibodies were also negative. On day 5 of hospitalization, creatine kinase (CK) level was high compared to on presentation. COVID-induced rhabdomyolysis was suspected and was dramatically improved with IV fluids. The patient was discharged on day 7 of admission. Our case shows that COVID-19 can present with an uncommon presentation like cardiac tamponade. Further studies are warranted to better understand the pathogenesis and management of COVID-19 myopericarditis."

    "abstract": "Vascular system injuries (VSIs) are one of the main causes of preventable mortality and morbidity of trauma patients. This study aimed to evaluate baseline characteristics, presenting signs, managements, and outcomes of patients presenting to emergency department (ED) with traumatic VSIs. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with traumatic VSIs admitted to the ED of a referral tertiary trauma center, during one year. Using a pre-prepared checklist, demographics, pre-hospital care, type of VSIs, injury severity score (ISS), anatomical location of trauma, associated injuries, method of surgery, complications, and outcome were collected from patients' profiles and reported. One hundred and twelve patients with the mean age of 33.5 ± 14.7 (range = 8 - 80) years were studied (90.2% male). Most of the patients were categorized as mild or moderate in terms of their ISS. 90 (80.4%) patients had at least one soft sign and 99 (88.4%) patients had at least one hard sign. Isolated arterial injury was diagnosed in 90 (80.4%) patients, isolated venous injuries in 12 (10.7%) cases, and combined arteriovenous injuries in 10 (8.7%) patients. The most common associated injury was tendon rupture (63.4%) and nerve injuries were present in 60.7% of patients. 1 (0.9%) patient died, 6 (5.4%) patients went through amputation, and 3 (2.7%) patients were discharged against medical advice. The rest of the patients were discharged in perfect health. There was a significant correlation between trauma type (p = 0.001), upper and lower extremity trauma (p < 0.001), presence of distal ischemia and lack of pulse (p = 0.041), penetrating injury close to a major vessel (p = 0.006), type of injured vessels and arteries (p<0.001), injury to nerve (p = 0.011) and tendon (p = 0.007), presence of open fracture (p = 0.005), multiple trauma (p < 0.001), method of surgery (p < 0.001), and number of postoperative complications (p< 0.001) with poor outcome. The findings showed that the majority of the studied patients were young males, most of whom were discharged in perfect situation. Those who presented with higher ISS, or were affected by blunt trauma or injury to lower limb arteries had worse outcome than the others."

    "abstract": "Delayed splenic rupture is an often unpredictable event with high mortality. In this report, we discuss the successful management of delayed splenic rupture, presenting days after index injury, with no commonly associated injuries or blunt abdominal trauma. A 50 year old male, not on anticoagulants, presented with blunt trauma after driving his motorcycle into a tree. The patient sustained right 3-5 rib fractures, displaced right midclavicular fracture, 25 % right pneumothorax, T5-9 posterior spinous process fractures, left 2nd-5th metatarsal fractures, and scattered abrasions to the left foot, knee and hand. Focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) and admission abdominal multi-detector CT were negative for any intra-abdominal injuries. On hospital day 5, the patient acutely decompensated. FAST was grossly positive and emergent laparotomy revealed a splenic rupture. After a splenectomy, he recovered. The spleen is the most commonly injured organ in blunt abdominal trauma. Although acute injury often presents with imaging findings or sequelae of hemorrhagic shock, complications of splenic trauma have the potential to result in delayed catastrophe. Bedside ultrasonography is a useful tool to assess acute decompensation in trauma patients along with CT imaging. Prompt identification and hemorrhage control are crucial to survival after trauma. Repeat CT scans are also important for the identification of delayed splenic rupture and timely intervention. Delayed hemorrhage after blunt trauma should never be ruled out regardless of the injury complexity or length of hospital admission."

Anterior mediastinal mass can result in severe symptoms due to involvement of surrounding vital structures such as the great vessels, trachea-bronchial tree, and heart. We highlight a case of cardiac tamponade in a patient with an anterior mediastinal mass that was paradoxically worsened after decompressive pericardiocentesis. A 21-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with breathlessness and hypotension. Bedside focused cardiac ultrasound revealed cardiac tamponade which was made worse with an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the right heart chambers. The patient was intubated for respiratory failure, following which an ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was performed. Unexpectedly, his hemodynamic status worsened after aspiration of 1000 mL of pericardial fluid. A repeat focused cardiac ultrasound showed reduced pericardial effusion, but worsening of right heart chambers compression by the mediastinal mass. Re-expansion of the pericardium space with 600 mL of normal saline improved the patient's vital signs, and reduced the right heart compression. Computed tomography was deferred due to the patient's hemodynamic instability. Despite resuscitation with fluids and initiation of vasopressor, the patient's condition deteriorated. He succumbed to his illness due to obstructive shock causing multi-organ failure. The autopsy showed a large anterior mediastinal mass, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoma. This case demonstrated the therapeutic challenges of managing a shock patient with anterior mediastinal mass, and massive pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade."

    "title": "Paramedic Understanding of Tension Pneumothorax and Needle Thoracostomy (NT) Site Selection.",
    "abstract": "Introduction Tension pneumothorax is an immediate threat to life. Treatment in the prehospital setting is usually achieved by needle thoracostomy (NT). Prehospital personnel are taught to perform NT, frequently in the second intercostal space (ICS) at the mid-clavicular line (MCL). Previous literature has suggested that emergency physicians have difficulty identifying this anatomic location correctly. We hypothesized that paramedics would also have difficulty accurately identifying the proper location for NT. Methods A prospective, observational study was performed to assess paramedic ability to identify the location for treatment with NT. Participants were recruited during a statewide Emergency Medical Services (EMS) conference. Subjects were asked the anatomic site for NT and asked to mark the site on a shirtless male volunteer. The site was copied onto a transparent sheet lined up against predetermined points on the volunteer's chest. It was then compared against the correct location that had been identified using palpation, measuring tape, and ultrasound. Results 29 paramedics participated, with 24 (83%) in practice for more than five years and 23 (79%) doing mostly or all 9-1-1 response. All subjects (100%) reported training in NT, although six (21%) had never performed a NT in the field. Nine paramedics (31%) recognized the second ICS at the MCL as the desired site for NT, with 12 (41%) specifying only the second ICS, 11 (38%) specifying second or third ICS, and six (21%) naming a different location (third, fourth, or fifth ICS). None (0%) of the 29 paramedics identified the exact second ICS MCL on the volunteer. Mean distance from the second ICS MCL was 1.37 cm (interquartile range (IQR): 0.7-1.90) in the medial-lateral direction and 2.43 cm in the superior-inferior direction (IQR: 1.10-3.70). Overall mean distance was 3.12 cm from the correct location (IQR: 1.90-4.50). Most commonly, the identified location was too inferior (93%). Allowing for a 2 cm radius from the correct position, eight (28%) approximated the correct placement. 25 (86%) were within a 5 cm radius. Conclusion In this study, paramedics had difficulty identifying the correct anatomic site for NT. EMS medical directors may need to rethink training or consider alternative techniques."

    "abstract": "Sigmoid volvulus is a common cause of colon obstruction, while volvulus of the transverse colon rarely causes bowel obstruction. The occurrence of transverse colon volvulus after resection of the sigmoid colon volvulus is extremely rare. This report presents a 73-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain and peritonitis. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, and sigmoid volvulus and cecum perforation were confirmed. A right hemicolectomy, end-to-side ileotransverse colon anastomosis for the cecal perforation, and sigmoidectomy with end-colostomy (Hartmann's procedure) for the sigmoid volvulus were performed. A month later, the patient returned to the emergency room with abdominal distention and the blockage of colostomy. Abdominal CT revealed a transverse colon volvulus. A transverse and descending colon resection and ileorectal anastomosis were performed. The patient's condition was stable at the time of discharge from the hospital. The management of metachronous colon volvulus should include surgical intervention. If patients are not diagnosed immediately, their condition may deteriorate dramatically because of bowel infarction or peritonitis. It is essential to highlight this case, as many surgeons may not have attended a transverse colon volvulus after sigmoid volvulus, which might lead to high morbidity or mortality. Overall, metachronous colonic volvulus must be considered in the differential diagnosis of bowel obstruction, particularly in patients with significant risk factors. الانفتال السيني هو سبب شائع لانسداد القولون، بينما نادرا ما يتسبب انفتال القولون المستعرض في انسداد الأمعاء. ومن النادر للغاية حدوث انفتال القولون المستعرض بعد استئصال انفتال القولون السيني. يقدم هذا التقرير رجلا يبلغ من العمر ٧٣ عاما يعاني من آلام البطن والتهاب الصفاق. خضع المريض لبضع البطن الاستكشافي وتم التأكد من التواء القولون السيني وانثقاب الأعور. وتم إجراء استئصال النصف الأيمن للقولون، ومفاغرة القولون اللفائفي العرضي من طرف إلى جانب الانثقاب الأعور، واستئصال السيني مع فغر نهاية القولون (إجراء هارتمان) للانفتال السيني. بعد شهر، عاد المريض إلى الطوارئ يشتكي من انتفاخ في البطن وانسداد في فغر القولون. وكشف التصوير المقطعي المحوسب للبطن عن انفتال القولون المستعرض. تم استئصال القولون المستعرض والنازل ومفاغرة اللفائفي المستقيم. وخرج المريض من المستشفى في حالة مستقرة. يجب أن تشمل إدارة انفتال القولون متغير الزمن التدخل الجراحي. إذا لم يتم تشخيص المرضى على الفور، فقد تدهور حالتهم بشكل كبير بسبب احتشاء الأمعاء أو التهاب الصفاق. ومن الضروري تسليط الضوء على هذه الحالة لأن الكثير من الجراحين ربما لم يعالجوا انفتال القولون المستعرض بعد الانفتال السيني، مما قد يؤدي إلى ارتفاع معدلات المراضة أو الوفاة. بشكل عام، يجب مراعاة الانفتال القولوني المتغير الزمن في التشخيص التفريقي لانسداد الأمعاء، خاصة في المرضى الذين يعانون من عوامل خطر كبيرة."

    "abstract": "Ocular trauma may either be closed globe or open globe. Open globe injuries are full-thickness defects of the eyewall and are often differentiated by the mechanisms of injury from which they are caused: sharp or blunt trauma. They are ocular emergencies and can lead to substantial visual morbidity. Without timely intervention, damage is irreversible and leads to permanent vision loss. The goals of evaluation are to identify the mechanism of injury, characterize the extent of injury, and gather relevant history. If an open globe is suspected, ophthalmologic consultation should be requested. Once an open globe is diagnosed, preparations for surgery should be made immediately and steps should be taken to avoid further injury. Intraocular infection risk is relatively high, requiring immediate empiric systemic antibiotics. Emergent surgical exploration and primary closure is indicated whenever possible. After initial closure, secondary surgery and revision may be needed to improve vision outcomes, followed by extensive follow-up. In this review, best practices for evaluation and management are reviewed, with particular focus on the surgical approach and techniques."

    "abstract": "Regarding the pleural space after pneumonectomy for malignancy, a vast number of studies have assessed early drop in the fluid level, suggesting a broncho-pleural fistula, but only a small number of studies reported on the abnormal increase in the fluid level-a potentially lethal complication. In the present study, the available databases worldwide were screened and 19 cases were retrieved, including 14 chylothorax and 3 hydrothorax cases, 1 pneumothorax and 1 haemothorax case. Tension chylothorax is caused by mediastinal lymph node dissection as an assumed risk in radical cancer surgery. For tensioned haemothorax, the cause has not been elucidated, although lymphatic stasis associated with deep venous thrombosis was suspected. Tensioned pneumothorax was caused by chest wall damage after extrapleural pneumonectomy combined with low aspiration pressure on the chest drain. No cause was determined for none of the tensioned hydrothorax-all 3 cases had the scenario of pericardial resection in addition to pneumonectomy in common. Tensioned space after pneumonectomy for cancer manifests as cardiac tamponade. Initial management is emergent decompression of the heart and mediastinum. Final management depends on the fluid type (chyle, transudate, air, blood) and the medical context of each case. Of the 19 cases, 12 required a major surgical procedure as the definitive management."

Herein, we compared the pre- and postoperative outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection surgery before and after implementing the RT-PCR screening for all patients. We compared the postoperative results of 105 patients who underwent acute type A aortic dissection emergency surgery from January 2019 to October 2020 (Group I) and 109 patients who underwent the surgery following RT-PCR screening from November 2020 to March 2022 (Group II). The average waiting time from arrival at the hospital to admission to the operating room was 36 and 81 min in Groups I and II, respectively. Ruptured cardiac tamponade was observed preoperatively in 26.6% and 21.1% of Groups I and II patients, respectively. The preoperative waiting time due to RT-PCR screening did not contribute to the cardiac tamponade. Surgical complications such as bleeding (reopened chest), respiratory failure, cerebral neuropathy, or mediastinitis did not increase significantly. The number of deaths 30 days after surgery (Group I = 13 and Group II = 3) showed no significant difference between the groups. There were no cases of nosocomial COVID-19 infections. Preoperative COVID-19 screening is an important method to prevent nosocomial infections. The associated waiting time did not affect the number of preoperative ruptures or affect postoperative complications or mortality."

We included EMS activations involving TCA in adult (≥18 years) patients where resuscitation was attempted by EMS. Descriptive statistics for recommended and actual treatments were calculated and compared between blunt and penetrating trauma using χ2 and independent 2-group Mann-Whitney U tests. There were 35 state EMS protocols publicly available for review, of which 16 (45.7%) had a specific TCA protocol and 17 (48.5%) had a specific termination of resuscitation protocol for TCA. Recommended treatments varied. We then analyzed 9,565 EMS activations involving TCA (79.1% blunt, 20.9% penetrating). Most activations (93%) were managed by advanced life support. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 25.5% of activations, and resuscitation was terminated by EMS in 26.4% of activations. Median prehospital scene time was 16.4 minutes; scene time was shorter for penetrating mechanisms than blunt (12.0 vs 17.0 min, p < 0.001). Endotracheal intubation was performed in 32.0% of activations, vascular access obtained in 66.6%, crystalloid fluids administered in 28.8%, and adrenaline administered in 60.1%. Actual and recommended approaches to EMS treatment of TCA vary nationally. These variations in protocols and treatments highlight the need for a standardized approach to prehospital management of TCA in the U.S."

We report the process of diagnosis and emergency treatment for tension gastrothorax during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A 71-year-old woman with multiple surgical histories had nausea and vomiting for two days. She was transferred to our hospital with circulatory failure and loss of consciousness. She presented pulseless electric activity and received CPR immediately after arrival. The right atrium and right ventricle were collapsed in the echocardiography. A chest X-ray demonstrated a dilated intestine extending from the peritoneal cavity to the mediastinum. The nasogastric tube (NGT) drained 1000 mL of stomach content and alleviated the abdominal distension, and spontaneous circulation returned immediately after the drainage. Thoracoabdominal CT showed the stomach and the transverse colon had escaped from the peritoneal cavity to the mediastinum. We diagnosed the situation as tension gastrothorax due to an acquired diaphragmatic hernia. History of multiple surgery and multiple operative scars was the first step of the diagnostic process, and the chest X-ray during CPR was the key to the diagnosis. Tension gastrothorax can be misdiagnosed as other conditions. A chest X-ray should be preceded in non-trauma settings, unlike the setting of a tension pneumothorax in trauma patients. Gastrointestinal decompression with NGT placement could be attempted quickly to improve the hemodynamic condition."

    "abstract": "Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is a rare injury in the severely injured patient and is most commonly caused by blunt mechanisms. However, penetrating mechanisms can also dominate depending on regional and local factors. Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is difficult to diagnose and can be missed by primary diagnostic procedures in the resuscitation room. Initially not life-threatening, diaphragmatic ruptures can cause severe sequelae in the patient's long-term course if untreated. The objective of this study was to assess the epidemiology, associated injuries, and outcome of traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures based on a multicenter registry-based analysis. Data from all patients enrolled in the TraumaRegister DGU® between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. That multicenter database collects data on prehospital, intra-hospital emergency, intensive care therapy, and discharge. Included were all patients with a Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) score of 3 or above and patients with a MAIS score of 2 who died or were treated in the intensive care unit, for whom standard documentation forms had been completed and who had sustained a diaphragmatic rupture (AIS score of 3 or 4). The data has been analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U test. Of the 199,933 patients included in the study population, 687 patients (0.3%) had a diaphragmatic rupture. Of these, 71.9% were male. The mean patient age was 46.1 years. Blunt trauma accounted for 73.5% of the injuries. Primary diagnosis was established in the resuscitation room in 93.1% of the patients. Multislice helical computed tomography (MSCT) was performed in 82.7% of the cases. Rib fractures were detected in 60.7% of the patients with a diaphragmatic injury. Patients with diaphragmatic rupture had a higher mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) than patients without a diaphragmatic injury (32.9 vs. 18.6) and a higher mortality rate (13.2% vs. 9.0%). In contrast to the literature, primary diagnostic procedures in the resuscitation room detected relevant diaphragmatic ruptures (AIS ≥ 3) in more than 90% of the patients in our study population. In addition, complex associated serial rib fractures are an important diagnostic indicator."

    "abstract": "To identify demographic information, epidemiological factors, and clinical abnormalities that differentiate cats with severe trauma, defined as an Animal Trauma Triage Score (ATTS) ≥3 from those with mild injury (ATTS 0-2). Multicenter observational study utilizing data from the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care (ACVECC) Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) registry. ACVECC VetCOT Veterinary Trauma Centers. A total of 3859 cats with trauma entered into the ACVECC VetCOT registry between April 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019. None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cats were categorized by ATTS 0-2 (mild, 65.1%) and ≥3 (severe, 34.9%). There was no age difference between categories. Male animals, particularly intact animals, were overrepresented. Blunt trauma was more common than penetrating, with blunt trauma and a combination of blunt and penetrating trauma being more common in the severe trauma group. While 96.6% of cats with ATTS 0-2 survived to discharge, only 58.5% with ATTS ≥3 survived. Only 46.8% of cats with severe trauma had a point-of-care ultrasound performed, of which 8.9% had free abdominal fluid noted. Hospitalization and surgical procedures were more common in the severe trauma group. Transfusions occurred more frequently in the severe trauma group but only in 4.1% of these cats. Other than ionized calcium, all recorded clinicopathological data (plasma lactate, base excess, PCV, total plasma protein, blood glucose) differed between groups. Feline trauma patients with an ATTS ≥3 commonly present to Veterinary Trauma Centers and have decreased survival to discharge compared to patients with ATTS 0-2. Differences exist between these groups, including an increased frequency of blunt force trauma (particularly vehicular trauma), head and spinal trauma, and certain clinicopathological changes in the ATTS ≥3 population. Relatively low incidences of point-of-care ultrasound evaluation and transfusions merit further investigation."

    "title": "Small bowel perforation caused by thermal injury during colonic polypectomy: A case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Iatrogenic gastrointestinal perforation is a known uncommon complication of colonoscopy. The perforation usually occurs in the colon itself. Rarely, colonoscopic procedures can also cause the perforations of the small intestine. We describe the case of a 70-year-old man who experienced abdominal pain several hours after electrical polypectomy in the transverse colon. Urgent abdominal computed tomography scans showed a few bubbles on the frontal surface around the liver and a little extraluminal free air in the upper abdomen. Urgent exploratory laparotomy revealed a round perforation with a diameter of approximately 5 mm in the ileum 80 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, accompanied by the outflow of intestinal contents. A small bowel perforation by thermal injury was diagnosed during colonic polypectomy. The ileal perforation was repaired primarily after debridement of the perforation site and abdominal cavity. The patient recovered well after surgery. Histopathological examination of the perforation site demonstrated inflammatory necrosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Small bowel perforation should be considered after colonoscopic procedures although the incidence is exceedingly rare. Urgent exploratory laparotomy is warranted when a visceral perforation is identified after colonoscopy."

    "abstract": "Upper extremity arterial aneurysms are not common clinical conditions. It may causes ischemic gangrene or limb losses as a result of thromboembolic events due to endothelial damage. In this study, we aimed to investigate the etiology, management, and long-term outcome. A total of 55 upper extremity aneurysms between January 2009 and April 2018 were retrospectively investigated. The mean age was 41 ± 13 years, and the women and men were 13 (23.6%) and 42 (76.4%). The mean follow-up was 43 ± 18 months. The incidence of pseudoaneurysm was higher than the true aneurysm (64.5% vs. 35.5%). 30 (84%) patients who had pseudoaneurysm repaired primerely and 6 (16%) patients had patchplasty. About 58% of the true aneurysm caused by blunt trauma. 4 (21%) true brachial aneurysm patients were required emergency intervention due to distal ischemia. 16 (84.2%) patients operated using by saphenous vein graft. The primary and secondary patency was 87.5% and 93.8%. No limb or life loss occurred during follow-up. Pseudoaneurysms are more common among upper limb aneurysms and they occur mostly by iatrogenic causes. Blunt trauma can be main cause of the true aneurysm. Surgical resection of the aneurysm and interposition of saphenous vein graft provides excellent results in the long-term. los aneurismas arteriales de las extremidades superiores no son condiciones clínicas frecuentes.

    "abstract": "Duodenal injury following blunt abdominal trauma is extremely rare in children and many times, it has delayed presentation, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. A patient with complete duodenal transaction is a surgical challenge and management involves the time of presentation and extent of visceral damage. A 10-year-old boy was brought with features of bowel perforation after road traffic accident and underwent emergency laparotomy which revealed complete transaction of duodenum at D1 and D2 and pyloroduodenal junction extending toward lesser curvature. Primary closure of pyloroduodenal junction and D1-D2 was done with omental patch along with triple tube decompression (cholecystostomy, gastrostomy, and jejunostomy). The patient had an uneventful recovery. Primary closure of disturbed ends with triple diversion is a safe approach in young children with complete duodenal transaction in absence of gross peritoneal contamination and early presentation."

Clinical presentations are often non-specific and display the signs and symptoms of peritonitis. The diagnosis is usually made after exploratory laparotomy. A 70-year-old diabetic woman presented to the emergency department with sudden diffuse abdominal pain and hematuria of six hours duration. Physical examination revealed generalized peritonitis. Multi-slice abdominal and pelvic CT scans showed free air and fluid in the abdominal cavity. After proper resuscitation, the patient was transferred to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. A 2 cm full-thickness bladder rupture was noted at the dome of the bladder, which was repaired. We noticed free air in the urinary bladder wall postoperatively in the CT scan, which is the radiological sign of EC. The Pathology result was in concordance with the diagnosis. SRUB in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and EC is highlighted in this case study. Urinary bladder rupture secondary to EC should be considered When a diabetic patient with a history of urinary symptoms presents with an acute onset of abdominal pain suggestive of peritonitis. Uneventful recovery from SRUB is dependent on early diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Annular rupture is a rare and dreaded complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and even rarer when caused by predilatation balloon aortic valvuloplasty. This complication often presents as sudden cardiac tamponade with hypotension and requires urgent intervention. The traditional rescue strategy for patients with annular rupture is emergency surgical repair. However, the mortality rate is still high, considering that most patients who undergo TAVR are not candidates for conventional cardiac surgery. Therefore, there is a need for additional emergency treatment strategies to decrease mortality. This report describes a case of predilatation-induced annular rupture during TAVR that was successfully sealed at the rupture site by valve implantation. This case suggests that continuing with valve deployment may be a successful treatment for predilatation-induced annular rupture during TAVR."

    "abstract": "Delayed cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening complication of pericardial effusion in humans, has rarely been described in large animal models. We report here a pig with cardiac tamponade that developed 29 days after cardiac surgery. Case report. One 45-kg domestic pig. Open-chest surgery was performed on a pig to induce chronic heart failure. At 15 days after surgery, the pig's breathing appeared laboured; induced heart failure was considered the cause. Routine heart failure medications were administered. On day 28, the pig's status deteriorated. On day 29, echocardiography performed just before the pig's death showed a large pericardial effusion, mainly in the lateral and anterior walls of the right heart, with several fibre exudation bands. The right heart was severely compressed with an extremely small right ventricle. An emergency sternotomy was unsuccessful. Pathologic examination showed a severely thickened, fibrous pericardium. The pericardial sac was distended (up to 4.5 cm) and was full of dark brown, soft, friable material. Epicardial haemorrhage with a fresh, organised thrombus was noted in the pericardium. Delayed tamponade occurring at least 15 days after open-chest surgery is easy to misdiagnose or overlook in large animal models where attention is often focused on primary pathological model changes. To decrease mortality in animal models, researchers should be aware of potential complications and use the same level of follow-up monitoring of large animals as in clinical care."

    "abstract": "Gastric outlet obstruction is an uncommon complication of surgical treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease with aortofemoral bypass. The most frequent presenting feature of duodenal erosion due to aortic synthetic graft is upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can range from a minor \"herald\" bleed to exsanguinating hemorrhage. A 64-year-old male patient with an aortofemoral Dacron bypass due to aortoiliac occlusive disease TASC II D with a chronic graft infection required emergency resection of the right limb of the Dacron graft two years ago. The patient developed abdominal pain, postprandial vomiting and progressive weight loss with an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that showed Dacron graft material eroding into the fourth portion of the duodenum generating a gastric outlet obstruction without aortoenteric fistula and ulceration in the duodenal mucosa. The treatment goals of aortoenteric fistula are to control hemorrhage, treat infection, maintain adequate distal perfusion, graft explantation and aortic reconstructions like in this case. Traditional treatment of aortoenteric fistula is graft excision and establishing an anatomic autologous or an extra-anatomic synthetic bypass. Neo aortoiliac system procedure has shown to be the most effective and safest emerging technique today. Aortoenteric fistula is a life-threatening condition associated with high morbidity and mortality and it can also pose a diagnostic dilemma. There are many presentations of aortoenteric fistula including gastric outlet obstruction syndrome. The neo aortoiliac system procedure is the ideal curative surgical approach in stable patients."

Various aetiologies have been reported in the literature, but the condition is most commonly seen after hysterectomy in post-menopausal women. Prompt reduction of the bowel is necessary to prevent ischaemic complications. Although most cases in the past have been managed by exploratory laparotomy, the condition may be managed laparoscopically if the prolapsed bowel is viable, giving the benefit of minimally invasive surgery to the patient. A hybrid approach of laparoscopic bowel reduction and per vaginal repair of the vault is technically simple and can be performed even by non-expert surgeons in an emergency setting."

    "abstract": "Mesenteric schwannomas are rare benign tumors that arise in the mesentery. Ileal diverticula and intestinal malrotation in adults are rare findings, since they are usually asymptomatic. We present the case of an 86-year-old man, without any known previously known medical conditions, who was admitted in the emergency department with recurrent abdominal distension and intense pain. The radiological study suggested an intestinal malrotation. An exploratory laparotomy confirmed the intestinal malrotation with intermesenteric bands, as well as a mesenteric mass adjacent to an ileal diverticulum. Following a segmental enterectomy, the histology of the mass reported a mesenteric schwannoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such association. We therefore present this report to showcase the diagnostic and therapeutical challenges in managing these conditions. Os schwanomas mesentéricos são tumores benignos raros com origem nas células de Schwann do mesentério. Divertículos ileais e má-rotação intestinal em adultos são também achados raros, por serem geralmente assintomáticos. Neste artigo apresentamos o caso de um homem de 86 anos, sem antecedentes conhecidos, que recorre à urgência por um quadro de dor abdominal e distensão. O estudo imagiológico sugeria uma má rotação intestinal, pelo que se realizou uma laparotomia exploradora, onde se verificaram várias bandas intermesentéricas, bem como uma massa mesentérica adjacente a um divertículo ileal. Foi realizada lise de bandas e uma enterectomia segmentar. A avaliação anatomo-patológica mostrou tratar-se de um schwanoma mesentérico. Tanto quanto é do nosso conhecimento, este é o primeiro relato de um caso com esta associação tripla, e tem como objetivo reforçar os desafios diagnósticos e terapêuticos na abordagem destas patologias."

    "abstract": "The pathological involvement of the heart is frequent in SARS-Coronavirus-2 infection (COVID-19) with various clinical and echocardiographic manifestations during the course of the disease. A 69-year-old female patient with severe COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome undergoing mechanical ventilation developed acute left ventricular dysfunction, that successfully improved with vasoactive therapy. After 5 days, she suddenly developed hemodynamic instability due to acute onset of pericardial effusion, which required emergency pericardiocentesis. Ultrasound-guided parasternal pericardiocentesis with high-frequency linear probe and lateral-to-medial in-plane approach was performed by inserting a central venous catheter using a Seldinger technique. 700 mL of serous fluid was drained resolving the acute critical state. Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade is a rare manifestation of Covid-19. Despite the diffusion of echocardiography, emergency cardiac procedures could be particularly difficult to be performed in a pandemic scenario of limited resources and the heterogeneous skills of the professional figures involved in the management of COVID-19 patients. The spread of expertise in ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation makes this approach attractive for anesthesiologists, emergency medicine and critical care specialists too. Furthermore in this pericardiocentesis' technique, the high-frequency linear probe adds optimal spatial resolution to maintain a close control of the needle's direction. However the need of a good parasternal view and a deep ultrasound knowledge are crucial to avoid iatrogenic complications. In conclusion, ultrasound-guided lateral-to-medial parasternal pericardiocentesis with high-frequency linear probe is an alternative to treat potential lethal acute haemodynamic instability due to cardiac tamponade."

    "abstract": "A key component of trauma system evaluation is the Injury Severity Score (ISS). The ISS is dependent on the AIS, and as AIS versions are updated this effects the number of patients within a health system which are considered severely injured (ISS >15). This study aims to analyse the changes comparing AIS1998 and AIS2015, and its impact on injury severity scoring and survival prediction model in a major trauma centre. This retrospective study reviewed all blunt trauma admissions from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020 from the trauma registry of Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Patients were manually double coded with AIS1998 and AIS2015 by the same experienced trauma nurse who have completed both AIS 1998 and AIS 2015 Courses. AIS patterns and Injury Severity Scores (ISS) derived from AIS 1998 and 2015 were compared using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The area under the receiving operator curve (AUROC) was compared based on the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) model using AIS 1998 and AIS 2015. 739 patients were included. There were 34 deaths within 30 days (30-day mortality rate 4.6%). Patients coded with AIS2015 compared with AIS1998 had significant reductions in the classification of serious, severe and critical categories of AIS, with a substantial increase in the mild and moderate categories. The largest reduction was observed in the head and neck region (Z = -11.018, p < 0.001), followed by the chest (Z = -6.110, p < 0.001), abdomen (Z = -4.221, p < 0.001) and extremity regions (Z = -4.252, p < 0.001). There was a 27% reduction in number of cases with ISS >15 in AIS2015 compared with AIS1998. Rates of 30-day mortality, ICU admission, emergency operation and trauma team activation of ISS > 15 using AIS 1998 were similar to the cut off for New Injury Severity Score (NISS) >12 using AIS 2015. The AUROC from the TRISS (AIS2015) was 0.942, and not different from the AUROC for TRISS (AIS1998) of 0.936. The sensitivity and specificity were 93.9% and 82.1% for TRISS (AIS2015), and 93.9% and 76.0% for TRISS (AIS1998). Trauma centres should be aware of the impact of the AIS2015 update on the benchmarking of trauma care, and consider the need for updating the ISS cut off for major trauma definitions."

    "abstract": "Determine whether geriatric victims of blunt trauma who preferred to communicate in a language other than English waited longer for pain medication or received more imaging studies than English-speaking patients with the same age and injuries. Secondary outcomes were the type of medication administered and number of imaging studies. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all trauma activations to a single academic urban medical center from January 2019 to October 2019. We included all hemodynamically stable patients older than 65, with head or torso trauma after a low energy injury, and on at least one medication that was an anti-coagulant, anti-platelet, or chemotherapeutic. We identified 1,153 unique patients (17, 379 radiologic studies) performed from January 2019 to October 2019, with a median of 5 (4-6) radiologic studies per patient. We excluded 419 patients for whom the language used was not reported (n = 7), no imaging was not reported (n = 16), or no medication was recorded as given (n = 409), leaving 734 patients for further analysis. Of those 734 patients, 460 preferred to communicate in English, 84 in Mandarin Chinese, 64 in Spanish, 37 in Cantonese Chinese, and 35 in Korean, and 29 in Russian. Across all languages patient age and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were comparable. Those who preferred to communicate in Spanish, Russian, or Korean were more likely to be female than those who preferred English, Mandarin, or Cantonese, but this tendency was not statistically significant (χ2-test; p = 0.051, 0.15 after Bonferroni correction). We did not find a statistically significant association between preferred language and time to medication, fraction of opioids used as first-line pain medication, or number of imaging studies performed. Across all patients, the most common medications administered were acetaminophen (524/734, 71%), any opioid (111/734, 15%), followed by local infiltration or nerve block with lidocaine (49/734, 6.7%). A retrospective analysis of patients with low-risk blunt trauma found no relationship between preferred language, time to pain medication, use of opioids or number of imaging studies."

    "abstract": "Prehospital trauma team activation (TTA) criteria allow for early identification of severely injured trauma patients. Although most TTA criteria are objective, one TTA criterion is subjective: emergency provider discretion. The study objective was to define the ability of emergency department physician and nurse discretion to accurately perform prehospital triage of high risk trauma patients. All highest level TTAs arriving to our American College of Surgeons (ACS)-verified Level 1 trauma center (06/2015-08/2020) were included. Exclusions were undocumented prehospital vitals or discharge disposition. At our institution, TTAs are triggered for standard ACS TTA criteria and age > 70 with traumatic mechanism other than ground level fall. Patients meeting ≥ 1 criterion apart from \"Emergency Provider Discretion\" were defined as Standard TTAs and patients meeting only \"Emergency Provider Discretion\" were defined as Discretion TTAs. Univariable/multivariable analyses compared injury data and outcomes. 4540 patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria: 3330 (73%) Standard TTAs and 1210 (27%) Discretion TTAs. Discretion TTAs were younger (34 vs. 37 years, p < 0.001) and more frequently injured by penetrating trauma (38% vs. 33%, p = 0.008), particularly stab wounds (64% vs. 29%). Overtriage rates were comparable after Discretion vs. Standard TTAs (33% vs. 31%, p = 0.141). Blood transfusion < 4 h (31% vs. 32%, p = 0.503) and ICU admission ≥ 3 days (25% vs. 27%, p = 0.058) were comparable between groups. Discretion TTA was independently associated with increased need for emergent surgery (OR 1.316, p = 0.005). Emergency provider discretion accurately identifies major trauma, with comparable rates of overtriage as standard TTA criteria. Discretion TTAs were as likely as Standard TTAs to require early blood transfusion and prolonged ICU stay. After controlling for confounders, Discretion TTAs were significantly more likely to require emergent surgical intervention. Emergency provider discretion should be recognized as a valid method of identifying major trauma patients at high risk of need for intervention."

BSS is a rare condition characterized by hemisection or hemicompression of the spinal marrow. The herein-described case of incomplete BSS due to OLF responded to conservative treatment. However, the successful nonoperative management of this case is insufficient evidence to consider it as the standard of care. Therefore, emergency laminectomy decompression remains the standard of care for BSS."

We report the case of a 10-day-old neonate with cardiac tamponade secondary to a PICC line who was successfully treated by pericardiocentesis. An Iranian (Asian) preterm male neonate was born by Cesarean section with a birth weight of 1190 g and a first-minute Apgar score of 7. Based on an increased respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) score from 4 to 7, resuscitation measures and intubation were performed at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). On day 3 after birth, a PICC line was inserted for parenteral therapy. A chest X-ray confirmed that the tip of the PICC line was in the appropriate position. Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 72 h post-NICU admission because of the improved respiratory condition. On the day 10 post-NICU admission, he suddenly developed hypotonia, apnea, hypoxia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Resuscitation and ventilation support were immediately started, and inotropic drugs were also given. Emergency echocardiography showed a severe pericardial effusion with tamponade. The PICC line was removed, and urgent pericardiocentesis was carried out. The respiratory situation gradually improved, the O2 saturation increased to 95%, and vital signs remained stable. Dramatic improvement of the neonate's clinical responses after pericardial drainage and PICC removal were suggestive of PICC displacement, pericardial perforation, and cardiac tamponade."

She was found to have ST-elevation myocardial infarction with 100% occlusion of her left anterior descending artery, and aspiration thrombectomy was performed. Blood cultures confirmed Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia. Our team used a clinical tool to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography was warranted to investigate for infective endocarditis. The patient's transesophageal echocardiogram showed a large mobile vegetation on her mitral valve. Given the presence of infective endocarditis in the absence of known coronary artery disease, we determined that the patient had likely developed acute coronary syndrome from a septic embolus originating from her mitral valve vegetation. Further investigation for the source of the bacteremia revealed a perforation 20 cm from the anal verge at the rectosigmoid junction. After perforation repair, the patient became hypoxic and tachycardic with diffuse abdominal pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, and loss of pulse. Exploratory laparotomy revealed air in the mesentery consistent with extraperitoneal perforation of the rectum, and an end-colostomy was performed. Unfortunately, the patient subsequently died."

A rare complication of this procedure is pericardial decompression syndrome which results in a paradoxical cardiovascular collapse. A 65-year-old male with bacterial endocarditis status posts mitral and aortic valve replacement presented for an emergent subxiphoid pericardial window to relieve cardiac tamponade. After draining 850mL of pericardial fluid, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest secondary to acute right ventricular failure seen on an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Despite manual compressions and high-dose vasopressors, hemodynamics did not improve, and the patient was emergently placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support.

The splenectomy/emergency laparotomy ratio was inferior at level 1 TC for high-grade splenic injuries (30.8% for level 1 and 100% for level 2), whose patients presented higher incidence of other injuries. Splenic NOM failure was registered in only one case (3.3%). At multivariate analysis, systolic pressure, spleen organ injury scale (OIS) and injury severity score (ISS) resulted significant predictive factors for NOM, and only spleen OIS was predictive factor for splenectomy (Odds Ratio 0.14, 0.04-0.49 CI 95%, P < .01). Both level 1 and 2 trauma centers demonstrated application of NOM with a high rate of success with some management difference in the treatment and outcome of patients with splenic injuries between the two types of TCs."

    "abstract": "We sought to compare the complication rates of prehospital needle decompression, finger thoracostomy and three tube thoracostomy systems (Argyle, Frontline kits and endotracheal tubes) and to determine if finger thoracostomy is associated with shorter prehospital scene times compared with tube thoracostomy. In this retrospective cohort study we abstracted data on adult trauma patients transported by three helicopter emergency medical services to five Major Trauma Service hospitals who underwent a prehospital thoracic decompression procedure over a 75-month period. Comparisons of complication rates for needle, finger and tube thoracostomy and between tube techniques were conducted. Multivariate models were constructed to determine the relative risk of complications and length of scene time by decompression technique. Two hundred and fifty-five patients underwent 383 decompression procedures. Fifty eight patients had one complication, and two patients had two complications. There was a weak association between decompression technique (finger vs tube) and adjusted risk of overall complication (RR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.33-1.03, P = 0.061). Recurrent tension physiology was more frequent in finger compared with tube thoracostomy (13.9 vs 3.2%, P < 0.001). Adjusted prolonged (80th percentile) scene time was not significantly shorter in patients undergoing finger vs tube thoracostomy (56 vs 63 min, P = 0.197), nor was the infection rate lower (2.7 vs 2.1%, P = 0.85). There was no clear evidence for benefit associated with finger thoracostomy in reducing overall complication rates, infection rates or scene times, but the rate of recurrent tension physiology was significantly higher. Therefore, tube placement is recommended as soon as practicable after thoracic decompression."

    "title": "Developing a decision instrument to guide abdominal-pelvic imaging of blunt trauma patients: Methodology and protocol of the NEXUS abdominal-pelvic imaging study.",
    "abstract": "Although computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (A/P) can provide crucial information for managing blunt trauma patients, liberal and indiscriminant imaging is expensive, can delay critical interventions, and unnecessarily exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Currently no definitive recommendations exist detailing which adult blunt trauma patients should receive A/P CT imaging and which patients may safely forego CT. Considerable benefit could be realized by identifying clinical criteria that reliably classify the risk of abdominal and pelvic injuries in blunt trauma patients. Patients identified as \"very low risk\" by such criteria would be free of significant injury, receive no benefit from imaging and therefore could be safely spared the expense and radiation exposure associated with A/P CT. The goal of this two-phase nationwide multicenter observational study is to derive and validate the use of clinical criteria to stratify the risk of injuries to the abdomen and pelvis among adult blunt trauma patients. We estimate that nation-wide implementation of a rigorously developed decision instrument could safely reduce CT imaging of adult blunt trauma patients by more than 20%, and reduce annual radiographic charges by $180 million, while simultaneously expediting trauma care and decreasing radiation exposure with its attendant risk of radiation-induced malignancy. Prior to enrollment we convened an expert panel of trauma surgeons, radiologists and emergency medicine physicians to develop a consensus definition for clinically significant abdominal and pelvic injury. In the first derivation phase of the study, we will document the presence or absence of preselected candidate criteria, as well as the presence or absence of significant abdominal or pelvic injuries in a cohort of blunt trauma victims. Using recursive partitioning, we will examine combinations of these criteria to identify an optimal \"very low risk\" subset that identifies injuries with a sensitivity exceeding 98%, excludes injury with a negative predictive value (NPV) greater than 98%, and retains the highest possible specificity and potential to decrease imaging. In Phase 2 of the study we will validate the performance of a decision rule based on these criteria among a new cohort of patients to ensure that the criteria retain high sensitivity, NPV and optimal specificity. Validating the sensitivity of the decision instrument with high statistical precision requires evaluations on 317 blunt trauma patients who have significant abdominal-pelvic injuries, which will in turn require evaluations on approximately 6,340 blunt trauma patients. We will estimate potential reductions in CT imaging by counting the number of abdominal-pelvic CT scans performed on \"very low risk\" patients. Reductions in charges and radiation exposure will be determined by respectively summing radiographic charges and lifetime decreases in radiation morbidity and mortality for all \"very low risk\" cases.

Multicenter, retrospective study, 2014-2020. Data were extracted from a multicenter French trauma registry including nine trauma centers within a physician-led prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) system. Patients less than 18 years old were included. Those who did not receive prehospital intervention by a mobile medical team and those with missing data on TXA administration were excluded. None. Nine-hundred thirty-four patients (median [interquartile range] age: 14 yr [9-16 yr]) were included, and 68.6% n = 639) were male. Most patients were involved in a road collision (70.2%, n = 656) and suffered a blunt trauma (96.5%; n = 900). Patients receiving TXA (36.6%; n = 342) were older (15 [13-17] vs 12 yr [6-16 yr]) compared with those who did not. Patient severity was higher in the TXA group (Injury Severity Score 14 [9-25] vs 6 [2-13]; p < 0.001). The median dosage was 16 mg/kg (13-19 mg/kg). TXA administration was found in 51.8% cases ( n = 256) among patients with criteria for appropriate use. Conversely, 32.4% of patients ( n = 11) with an isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) also received TXA. Age (odds ratio [OR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2), A and B prehospital severity grade (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 4.1-12.3 and OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.9-6.9 respectively), and year of inclusion (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3) were associated with prehospital TXA administration. In our physician-led prehospital EMS system, TXA is used in a third of severely injured children despite the lack of high-level of evidence. Only half of the population with greater than or equal to one criteria for appropriate TXA use received it. Conversely, TXA was administered in a third of isolated severe TBI. Further research is warranted to clarify TXA indications and to evaluate its impact on mortality and its safety profile to oversee its prescription."

    "abstract": "Biliary stents are frequently associated with various complications; however biliary stent migration causing duodenal perforation is rare and has only been reported in few cases. We present a case of 33 years old male with pain abdomen and fever for 2 days came to Emergency department. He had undergone open common bile duct exploration (CBD), clearance of stone and placement of CBD stent. In X-ray abdomen, biliary stent migration was suspected. CECT abdomen was done for the confirmation of diagnosis which showed migrated stent with duodenal perforation. Patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and Thal patch repair, pyloric exclusion, retrograde duodenostomy and feeding jejunostomy. Post-operative period was uneventful. Biliary stents are used to relieve biliary obstruction. There is increasing use of endoscopic retrograde drainage via plastic endoprosthesis and so the related morbidities. One of the rare but serious complications is intestinal perforation and duodenal perforation is seen in most of the cases, explanation being the relative fixed position of the duodenum. Although intestinal perforation is an uncommon complication following CBD stenting, we should suspect it in patients presenting with pain and fever."

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled hemorrhage poses a severe life-threatening situation. However, traditional hemostats still have various limitations. It is urgent to develop a material with excellent biocompatibility and hemostatic ability. Evidence has shown that carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) has hemostatic properties and good compatibility. Herein, we develop an expandable hemostatic sponge by modifying CMCS with cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) through the CO-NH cross-linking method. We verified its potential as a hemostatic agent both in vivo and in vitro. The results demonstrated that the prepared carboxymethyl chitosan/cellulose nanofiber composite (CNF-CMCS) sponges could absorb blood, quickly expand to exert pressure in the wound, and exhibit an excellent coagulation ability. The CNF-CMCS sponges significantly decreased the bleeding time and blood loss in several hemorrhage models and possessed a significant advantage in treating the deep penetrating injury hemorrhage. Therefore, the sponges provide a unique application prospect and potential as a penetrating trauma hemostatic agent."

One possible explanation could be delays in emergent medical care. This study aims to assess if a disparity between races exists amongst acutely head-injured geriatric patients, as evidenced by the time it takes from emergency department (ED) presentation to performance of head computerized tomography (CT) imaging. A prospective cohort study was conducted from August 15, 2019 to August 14, 2020 at the two trauma centers in a south Florida county covering 1.5 million residents. Patients aged ≥ 65 years who sustained a head injury were identified daily. Patients who had a head injury >24 h prior, sustained penetrating trauma, or were transferred from another hospital were excluded. The primary outcome was time measured between ED presentation and CT head performance. Patients were grouped by race as selected from White, Black, Hispanic, and other. Comparisons were made using ANOVA analysis. 4878 patients were included. 90% were White. The mean times to CT head were 90.3 min for White patients, 98.1 min for Black patients, and 86.6 min for Hispanic patients. There was a significant difference comparing time to CT between the three groups (F = 2.892, p = 0.034). Comparing each group to a combined others, there were no significant differences for White vs non-White (90.3 vs 91.3, F = 0.154, p = 0.695) or Hispanic vs non-Hispanic (86.6 vs 90.5, F = 0.918, p = 0.338); however Black vs non-Black (98.1 vs 89.9, F = 4.828, p = 0.028) was significant. Geriatric Black patients who sustained head trauma were found to have a longer time from ED presentation to performance of head CT than their non-Black counterparts."

    "abstract": "To explore the association between perirenal fat thickness (PFT) and renal trauma grade. We hypothesise this association is related to a shock-absorbing effect of adiposity around the kidney. We identified all patients with renal trauma who arrived at the emergency department of a single trauma centre between 2014 and 2020. Radiology images were reviewed to measure the PFT around the uninjured kidney due to disrupted PFT around the traumatised kidney. Patients with no available images or penetrating trauma mechanism were excluded. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation between PFT and high-grade renal trauma (HGRT; defined as American Association for the Surgery of Trauma Renal Grade IV-V), adjusting for age, sex, and Injury Severity Scale (ISS). A total of 150 patients with renal trauma were included. The median (interquartile range) age was 38.5 (26-52) years and 106 (70.7%) were males. The PFT ranged between 2.1 and 50.1 mm, and 31 (20.7%) had HGRT. Interestingly, PFT only mildly correlated with body mass index (BMI; Pearson correlation coefficient 0.42, P < 0.001). Those with HGRT had significantly lower PFT compared to those without HGRT (median 9.5 vs 11.9 mm, P = 0.047). In the multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, and ISS, increasing PFT was associated with decreased odds (odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.84-0.98; P = 0.015) of HGRT. Increasing PFT is associated with lower risk of HGRT following blunt injury. These results support a protective cushion role of adiposity in renal trauma. Notably, PFT was not strongly correlated with BMI, underscoring limitations of BMI in measuring adiposity."

    "abstract": "Left ventricular (LV) free wall ruptures (LVFWRs) of myocardial infarctions (MIs) are still one of the most fatal mechanical complications after an acute MI (AMI). LVFWRs are estimated to occur in 0.01% to 0.52% of patients following an ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and are rarely reported in the setting of a non- or subtle-ST-elevation MI. We herein present a report of a 92-year-old male rescue case with an LVFWR following a small subtle-STEMI. Contrast cardiac computed tomography was useful to diagnose the LVFWR. An emergent cardiac surgery was performed. Finally, the patient's life was saved. This case demonstrates that even without clinical evidence of transmural infarction such as non- or subtle-STEMI, those patients may carry a risk of fatal complications including LVFWR, especially in older age and a first lateral wall AMI without collateral flow, as in this present case. Thus, the physicians should be aware of the possibility of LVFWRs even in the setting of an AMI without or with subtle-ST-elevation. High clinical suspicion and vigilance are the cornerstones of a timely and accurate diagnosis of LVFWR. This is the first report of a rescue case of a patient with an LVFWR associated with a subtle-STEMI."

This was a retrospective study of all children less than 18 years of age who underwent an emergency laparotomy for trauma between December 2012 and October 2020 at Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. During the eight-year period under review, a total of 136 children of which 107 were male underwent a laparotomy for trauma. The median age was 14 years. There were 80 (57.1%) blunt mechanisms, and the rest were penetrating mechanisms. A total of 46 (33%) patients required ICU admission. Thirty-four patients developed a complication. These included nine cases of pneumonia, one case of renal failure, two patients developed abdominal collections, three woundrelated complications, three neurological complications and one miscellaneous complication. There were seven (5%) deaths. The penetrating cohort were older than the blunt cohort. Solid viscera were more likely to be injured in the blunt cohort and hollow viscera more likely in the penetrating cohort. A total of 16 (11%) patients underwent damage control surgery (DCS). Of this cohort, there were three female children. Six sustained blunt trauma and ten penetrating trauma. A total of six (37%) of these children died. Emergency laparotomy for trauma in children is not infrequent in Pietermaritzburg and there is a high incidence of penetrating trauma in this cohort. The response to increased degrees of physiological derangement is the application of DCS. Ongoing efforts to develop and strengthen a paediatric trauma service appear to be justified."

A 74-year-old male presented to the urgent care of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary with blurry vision and discomfort in his left eye for three weeks. His vision was 20/50, with intraocular pressure of 13 mmHg, and slit lamp examination was significant for conjunctival congestion, 1+ anterior segment cell and flare, and diffuse keratic precipitates. His right eye was no light perception with a condensed hyphema, intraocular lens and inferonasal tube. His medical history included coronary artery bypass, prostate cancer, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. His ocular history included blunt trauma to the right eye at age 11 with development of a traumatic macular hole and later rhegmatogenous retinal detachment at age 53, repaired with multiple vitreoretinal procedures. He developed glaucoma in the right eye and was treated with a tube shunt and ultimately transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) 7 years later, 13 years prior to his presentation of the left eye. Dilated fundus examination of his left eye revealed diffuse chorioretinal folds in the macula without any discrete chorioretinal lesions. Ultrasound of the right showed serous macular detachments with scleral thickening. Presumptive diagnosis of sympathetic ophthalmia was made and oral corticosteroid therapy was initiated. Subsequent SD-OCT and en-face OCT-A demonstrated Dalen-Fuchs nodules within the macula underlying areas of resolved serous detachment, after 6 weeks of oral steroids and initiation of immunomodulatory therapy (IMT). Sympathetic ophthalmia may rarely present with very delayed onset, and TSCPC is an uncommon inciting event. These patients may develop serous detachment, choroidal folds and inflammatory nodules identifiable on exam and multimodal imaging, which can resolve when treated appropriately. OCT-A may provide utility in monitoring response to immunosuppressive treatment in these patients."

Multi-disciplinary work-up is crucial to achieving a comprehensive understanding of these patients. The present study demonstrated the experience of an acute care surgery (ACS) model for rib fracture management from a single level I trauma center over 13 years. Data from patients diagnosed with acute rib fractures from January 2008 to December 2020 were collected from the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Information, including patient age, sex, injury mechanism, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) in different anatomic regions, injury severity score (ISS), index admission department, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), total admission LOS, mortality, and other characteristics of multiple rib fracture, were analyzed. Patients who received surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) were analyzed separately, and basic demographics and clinical outcomes were compared between acute care and thoracic surgeons. A total of 5103 patients diagnosed with acute rib fracture were admitted via the emergency department (ED) of CGMH in the 13-year study period. The Department of Trauma and Emergency Surgery (TR) received the most patients (70.8%), and the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery (CTS) received only 3.1% of the total patients. SSRF was initiated in 2017, and TR performed fixation for 141 patients, while CTS operated for 16 patients. The basic demographics were similar between the two groups, and no significant differences were noted in the outcomes, including LOS, LCU LOS, length of indwelling chest tube, or complications. There was only one mortality in all SSRF patients, and the patient was from the CTS group. Acute care surgeons provided good-quality care to rib fracture patients, whether SSRF or non-SSRF. Acute care surgeons also safely performed SSRF. Therefore, we propose that the ACS model may be an option for rib fracture management, depending on the deployment of staff in each institute."

Currently, there are no published Australian guidelines on what constitutes adequate clinical information in computed tomography (CT) requests. This study aimed to determine specific items of clinical information radiologists require in CT requests for acute chest, abdomen and blunt trauma examinations, to support optimal reporting. A panel of 24 CT-reporting consultant radiologists participated in this e-Delphi consensus study. Panellists undertook multiple online survey rounds of open-ended, dichotomous and Likert scale questions, receiving feedback following each. Round 1 responses formulated lists for each CT examination. Round 2 set a threshold of 80% agreement after dichotomous scoring. Round 3 accepted items which averaged 4 or more on a 5-point Likert scale. Round 4 required panellists to rank items within the aggregated, accepted lists, based on panellists' perceived level of usefulness. The large numbers of round 1 items (chest: 101, abdomen: 76, blunt trauma: 80) were rationalised and grouped into categories to facilitate efficiency during subsequent rounds. Twenty-three chest, 24 abdomen and 17 blunt trauma items met the 80% agreement threshold in round 2. Items below threshold were included in round 3; numbering 44, 19 and 23 for chest, abdomen and blunt trauma, respectively. Through the e-Delphi process, we formulated clinical information criteria standards for three CT types. The developed standards will guide Australian referrers in providing adequate clinical information in CT requests, to support optimal reporting, diagnosis and treatment."

Purulent bacterial pericarditis remains a diagnostic challenge given its non-specific clinical and investigative features and carries exceedingly high mortality rates due to fulminant sepsis and morbidity including constrictive pericarditis in survivors. We present our management of cardiac tamponade and subsequent constrictive pericarditis due to Actinomyces meyeri PBP. A 53-year-old Caucasian male presented with acute New York Heart Association Class IV dyspnoea and chest discomfort, in the context of multiple hospital presentations over the preceding 8 weeks due to presumed recurrent viral pericarditis. On this admission, initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a large asymmetric pericardial effusion for which he underwent urgent pericardiocentesis. Serial TTE post-pericardiocentesis, however, demonstrated effusion re-accumulation and effusive-constrictive pericarditis, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Fluid culture was positive for A. meyeri. He was diagnosed with PBP, but his condition deteriorated despite appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy, necessitating semi-urgent surgical pericardiectomy. He recovered well and was discharged on Day 10 post-operatively. Unlike uncomplicated acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis, PBP portends a very poor prognosis if unrecognized and untreated. Diagnostic challenges persist given its rarity in modern clinical practice; however, PBP should be considered in cases of seemingly recurrent pericarditis. Multi-modal cardiac imaging and careful analysis of pericardial fluid including cultures and lactate dehydrogenase/serum ratios may assist in earlier recognition. In this case, source control and symptom relief were achieved only with combined intravenous antibiotics, surgical evacuation, and pericardiectomy."

    "abstract": "Reduction in patient-facing teaching encounters has limited practical exposure to Emergency Medicine for medical students. Simulation has traditionally provided an alternative to patient-facing learning, with increasing integration in courses. Rapid advancements in technology facilitate simulation of realistic complex simulations encountered in the emergency setting. This study evaluated the efficacy of high-fidelity simulation in undergraduate emergency trauma medicine teaching. A consultant trauma expert delivered an introductory lecture, followed by consultant-led small group transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) and chest drain simulations, and a splinting station. Participants then responded to a major trauma incident with simulated patients and high-fidelity mannequins. Pre- and post-surveys were administered to assess change in delegates' trauma surgery knowledge and confidence. One-group pretest-posttest research design. A higher education institution in the United Kingdom. A convenience sample of 50 pre-clinical and clinical medical students. Recall of the boundaries of the safe triangle for chest drain insertion improved by 46% (p < 0.01), and knowledge of cardinal signs of a tension pneumothorax improved by 26% (p = 0.02). There was a 22% increase in knowledge of what transoesophageal echocardiograms (TOEs) measure (p = 0.03), and 38% increased knowledge of contraindications for splinting a leg (p < 0.01). The average improvement in knowledge across all procedures when compared to baseline was 35.8% immediately post-simulation and 22.4% at six-weeks post-simulation. Confidence working in an emergency setting increased by 24% (p < 0.001) immediately, and by 27.2% (p < 0.001) at six weeks. The findings suggest that simulation training within emergency medicine can result in significant increases in both competency and confidence. Benefits were observed over a six-week period. In the context of reduced patient-facing teaching opportunities, emergency medicine simulation training may represent an invaluable mechanism for delivery of teaching."

Polytrauma patients accounted for 81.6% in the BBT group and 22.9% in the PBT group, and the mean Injury Severity Score was 38.22 ± 8.13 and 21.33 ± 6.12, respectively. Preoperative three-dimensional spiral computed tomography (CT) and/or fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) were performed in 92.1% of cases in the BBT group (n = 38) and 34.3% in the PBT group (n = 35). In the BBT group, a delay in diagnosis for over 48 h occurred in 55.3% of patients. In the PBT group, 31 patients underwent emergency thoracotomy due to massive hemothorax, and BT was confirmed during the operation. Among them, 22 underwent pulmo-tractotomy for hemostasis, avoiding partial pneumonectomy. In this series, the overall mortality rate was 6.9% (5/73), and it was 7.9% (3/38) and 5.7% (2/35) in the BBT group and PBT group, respectively (P > 0.05). All 68 survivors were followed for 6 to 42 (23 ± 6.4) mo, and CT, FB, and pulmonary function examinations were performed as planned. All patients exhibited normal lung function and healthy conditions except three who required reoperations. The difference between blunt and penetrating BTs is obvious. In BBT, patients generally have no vessel injury, and the diagnosis is easily missed, leading to delayed treatment. The main cause of death is ventilation disturbance due to tension pneumothorax early and refractory atelectasis with pneumonia late. However, in PBT, most patients require emergency thoracotomy because of simultaneous vessel trauma and massive hemothorax, and delays in diagnosis are infrequent. The leading cause of death is hemorrhagic shock."

    "abstract": "A 49-year-old female presented to the hospital with complaints of generalized weakness, subjective fevers, and chills. In the emergency department (ED), she was found to be hypotensive and tachycardic and met the sepsis criteria. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (CT A/P) with contrast revealed a liver abscess and a foreign body (FB) that was suspected to be the cause of the liver abscess. Of note, the patient had undergone a recent dental procedure due to an infected root canal, which had involved a dental screw. The patient was uncertain whether the dental screw had been removed, but she felt as though it was no longer there. At this time, the clinical suspicion was high for FB secondary to this dental procedure. The patient underwent interventional radiology (IR)-guided liver abscess drainage and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for the evaluation of the FB. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, but no evidence of the FB was found. This warranted an exploratory laparotomy (EL) to ensure the successful removal of the FB. Upon gross visualization by surgery, the FB was revealed to be a bone that the patient did not recall ingesting. However, surgical pathology evaluation revealed that the FB was actually a plastic stick. This rare case highlights the clinical approach to FB ingestion when complicated by liver abscess, as well as successful treatment with EL as opposed to laparoscopy which is the procedure of choice."

    "abstract": "Cardiac injury accounts for less than 10 % of all traumas and it is a fatal condition associated with cardiac tamponade or massive haemothorax, which requires immediate intervention, such as resuscitative thoracotomy. However, in case of haemothorax without the findings suggestive of cardiac damage such as pericardial effusion, it is difficult to determine the complications of cardiac injury, because injury of the lung or intercostal arteries is usually considered first. We describe a rare case of left atrial appendage rupture with a right-sided massive haemothorax with slight cardiac effusion. A 47-year-old man with no significant medical history was transferred to our emergency department after crashing his motorcycle into a car. A right resuscitative thoracotomy for massive haemothorax was performed, followed by hilarious clamping and pericardial drainage. We found continuous bleeding from a right dorsal pericardial injury which indicated cardiac injury. Soon after the patient was referred to the operating room, left atrial appendage rupture was found, and ligated. The postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on 15th postoperative day without complication. Left atrial appendage rupture is caused by a direct external force to the left atrium, so the pericardial injury is usually ipsilateral to the left side of the pericardium, resulting in perforation of the left thoracic cavity. Therefore, left atrial appendage rupture with a right-sided massive haemothorax is rare. In addition, when a cardiac injury is associated with a pericardial injury, most of the pericardial effusion drains into the thoracic cavity, resulting in a small amount of pericardial effusion, which make it difficult to recognize the cardiac injury. In conclusion, in blunt trauma, even in the case of a right-sided haemothorax, the possibility of cardiac injury in addition to pulmonary contusion should be considered and explored, because cardiac injury could be fatal."

    "abstract": "Despite treatment advances, trauma laparotomy continuous to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Most of the literature originates from high volume centers, whereas patient characteristics and outcomes in a Scandinavian setting is not well described. The objective of this study is to characterize treatments and outcomes of patients undergoing trauma laparotomy in a Scandinavian setting and compare this to international reports. A retrospective study was performed in the Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet (CUHR). All patients undergoing a trauma laparotomy within the first 24 h of admission between January 1st 2019 and December 31st 2020 were included. Collected data included demographics, trauma mechanism, injuries, procedures performed and outcomes. A total of 1713 trauma patients were admitted to CUHR of which 98 patients underwent trauma laparotomy. Penetrating trauma accounted for 16.6% of the trauma population and 66.3% of trauma laparotomies. Median time to surgery after arrival at the trauma center (TC) was 12 min for surgeries performed in the Emergency Department (ED) and 103 min for surgeries performed in the operating room (OR). A total of 14.3% of the procedures were performed in the ED. A damage control strategy (DCS) approach was chosen in 18.4% of cases. Our rate of negative laparotomies was 17.3%. We found a mortality rate of 8.2%. The total median length of stay was 6.1 days. The overall rates, findings, and outcomes of trauma laparotomies in this Danish cohort is comparable to reports from similar Western European trauma systems."

Our study presents a case of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis and conducts a literature review. A bibliographic research was conducted. Our research comprised 97 articles. Gender, age, symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and treatment were all included in the database of patient characteristics. A 51-year-old man complaining of a 2-day history of minor diffuse abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and constipation was presented in emergency department. Physical examination was indicative of intestinal obstruction. Laboratory tests were normal. Diffuse intraperitoneal fluid and dilated small intestinal loops were discovered on computed tomography (CT). An exploratory laparotomy was recommended, in which the sac membrane was removed and adhesiolysis was performed. He was discharged on the tenth postoperative day. There were 240 cases of abdominal cocoon syndrome in total. In terms of gender, 151 of 240 (62.9%) were male and 89 of 240 (37%) were female. Ages between 20 and 40 are most affected. Symptoms include abdominal pain and obstruction signs. For the diagnosis of abdominal cocoon syndrome, CT may be the gold standard imaging method. The surgical operation was the treatment of choice in the vast majority of cases (96.7%). Only 69 of 239 patients (28.9%) were detected prior to surgery, and CT was applied in these cases. Abdominal cocoon is a rare condition marked by recurrent episodes of intestinal obstruction. Surgical therapy is the most effective treatment option."

    "abstract": "Arytenoid cartilage dislocation is a rare and often overlooked complication of tracheal intubation or blunt laryngeal trauma. The most common symptom is persistent hoarseness. Although cases of arytenoid dislocation due to tracheal intubation are reported more frequently in otolaryngology, reports on its occurrence in the intensive care unit (ICU) are lacking. We report a case of delayed diagnosis of arytenoid cartilage dislocation after tracheal intubation in the ICU. A 20-year-old woman was referred to the ICU following a fall from a height. Her voice was normal; laryngeal computed tomography showed unremarkable findings on admission. However, due to deterioration of the patient's condition, tracheal intubation, and emergency exploratory laparotomy followed by laparoscopic surgery two d later under general anesthesia were performed. After extubation, the patient was sedated and could not communicate effectively. On the 10th day after extubation, the patient complained of hoarseness and coughing with liquids, which was attributed to laryngeal edema and is common after tracheal intubation. Therefore, specific treatment was not administered. However, the patient's symptoms did not improve. Five d later, an electronic laryngoscope examination revealed dislocation of the left arytenoid cartilage. The patient underwent arytenoid closed reduction under general anesthesia by an experienced otolaryngologist. Reported symptoms improved subsequently. The six-month follow up revealed that the hoarseness had resolved within four weeks of the reduction procedure. Symptoms of arytenoid cartilage dislocation are difficult to identify in the ICU leading to missed or delayed diagnosis among patients."

    "abstract": "Early recognition and effective treatment of internal bleeding impose a cardinal challenge for trauma teams. The reduction of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow is among the first compensatory responses to blood loss, thus being a promising candidate as a diagnostic tool for occult haemorrhage. Unfortunately, methods for monitoring the SMA flow have not been elaborated to date. Nevertheless, animal experiments suggest that exhaled methane (CH4) levels correspond to the SMA perfusion. We hypothesise that real-time detection of CH4 concentrations in the exhaled air is an applicable technique for the early recognition of haemorrhage in severely injured patients. We also hypothesise that exhaled CH4 levels reflect the volume of blood loss more accurately than conventional markers of blood loss and shock such as shock index, haemoglobin, base deficit, lactate, end-tidal carbon dioxide and sublingual microcirculatory indices. One hundred and eleven severely injured (Injury Severity Score ≥16), intubated, bleeding patients sustaining blunt trauma will be included in this prospective observational study. Blood loss will be detected with CT and estimated with CT-linked radiologic software. Exhaled CH4 concentrations will be monitored by attaching a near-infrared laser technique-based photoacoustic spectroscopy apparatus to the exhalation outlet of the ventilator on patient arrival. The primary outcome is the volume of blood loss. Need for massive transfusion and 24-hour mortality will constitute secondary outcomes. The relation of exhaled CH4 to study outcomes and its performance in predicting blood loss in comparison with conventional shock markers and microcirculatory indices will be tested. Our protocol (ID: 5400/2021-SZTE) has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04987411) and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the medical ethics committee at the University of Szeged (Ref.nr.:121/2021-SZTE RKEB).

    "abstract": "Myeloid Sarcoma (MS) are tumors containing myeloid blasts occurring in a location other than the bone marrow, including lymph nodes, skin, and soft tissues. MS presenting as polyserositis however is very rare, with only a few cases in the literature. A 20-year-old male presented with cough, shortness of breath and was found to have left upper lobe consolidation, left pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and a large anterior mediastinal mass. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. He underwent emergent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. The fluid studies showed flow cytometry findings consistent with MS/ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) phenotype. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were unremarkable and showed no immunophenotypic findings diagnostic of acute leukemia or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Cytogenetics was negative for AML abnormalities per FISH analysis. Videoassisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) with biopsy of the mediastinal mass, pericardium, and left upper lobe of the lung was consistent with MS. He was treated with induction cytarabine and idarubicin, and a follow up PET-CT scan showed complete remission. He is currently day 200 + post stem cell transplant with no evidence of disease recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated myeloid sarcoma presenting as polyserositis, without prior leukemia/ bone marrow involvement. Hence, fluid studies should involve cytometry analysis and MS should be entertained as a differential for polyserositis, even without a history of prior leukemia. Timely diagnosis can expedite aggressive chemotherapy required for a potentially life-threatening disease."

All relevant studies were searched from Pubmed, EMbase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library (January 1, 2016, to June 1, 2021). The main outcomes of this literature meta-analysis were 30-day mortality, procedural time, new pacemaker implantation, total stay in the hospital, use of the vasoactive drug, and intra-and postoperative complications and emergencies, including conversion to open, myocardial infarction, pulmonary complication, vascular complication, renal injury/failure, stroke, transesophageal echocardiography, life-threatening/major bleeding, cardiac tamponade, and emergency PCI. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) together with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A total of 17 studies, including 20938 patients, in the final analysis, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Intra-and postoperative complications (myocardial infarction, vascular complication, renal injury/failure, stroke, and cardiac tamponade) undergoing TAVI in severe AS patients under GA do not offer a significant difference compared with LA. No differences were observed between LA and GA for new pacemaker implantation, total stay in the hospital, transesophageal echocardiography, and emergency PCI. LA has lower mortality compared with GA (RR 0.69, P = 0.600), pulmonary complications (RR 0.54, P = 0.278), life-threatening/major bleeding (RR 0.85, P = 0.855), and lower times of conversion to open (RR 0.22, P = 0.746). LA has many advantages, including a shorter procedure duration (MD=-0.38, P = 0.000) and reduction of the use of the vasoactive drug (RR 0.57, P = 0.000). For TAVI, both LA with or without sedation and GA are feasible and safe. LA appears a feasible alternative to GA for AS patients undergoing TAVI."

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal tract perforations as a result of foreign body ingestion are rare. Most ingested foreign bodies pass the intestines without complications. However, in 1 % of cases intestinal perforation occurs. We present the case of a 56-year old patient with an extensive surgical medical history who presented at the emergency department with progressive abdominal pain two weeks after accidental SARS-CoV-2 swab ingestion. On presentation patient was tachycardic and had generalized abdominal tenderness. A CT scan showed free intraperitoneal air and fatty infiltration of the ileocecal anastomosis (after an ileocoecal resection at the age of 46) continuing to the distal sigmoid. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a covid swab in the abdominal cavity with an indurated area of the sigmoid without perforation. Post-operative care was uneventful, and patient was dismissed after four days. Due to his medical history and the fact he was advised to regularly self-test for COVID, he routinely performed an oropharyngeal swab. Unfortunately, this resulted in swallowing the swab. A perforation tends to happen in regions of acute angulation, such as an anastomosis. Although the CT scan suggested the perforation was at the ileocecal anastomosis, no perforation was found during surgery, while the swab was found loose in the peritoneal cavity. Initial treatment should focus on endoscopic removal. In the case of gasto-intestinal perforation, surgery becomes the treatment of choice. A foreign body can migrate to peritoneal cavity without peritonitis or visible perforation perioperative."

    "abstract": "Thoracoabdominal injuries (TAI) are an important cause of trauma-related morbidity in children. Early and correct intervention is essential to reduce mortality. We aimed to determine factors associated with mortality and the need for intensive care in TAI. The children admitted to the pediatric emergency department of a tertiary care hospital with TAI in a 6-year-period were enrolled. Demographic data; mechanism of injuries; clinical, laboratory and imaging findings; length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay; invasive procedures and medical treatments; surgical interventions; and survival outcomes were recorded. The median age of the 136 children was 9 (IQR: 5-14) years and 72.8% were male. The vast majority of injuries were caused by blunt trauma (92.7%). Pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, splenic, and liver injuries were the most common diagnoses. Motor vehicle accidents were seen in more than half of the cases (52.2%). The median length of hospital stay was 5 (IQR: 2-8) days; 21 patients were hospitalized in the ICU (15.4%). The need for intensive care was higher in patients with lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and lower Pediatric Trauma Scores (PTSs), in the presence of multiple injuries, pulmonary contusion, and pneumothorax (p<0.001). Mortality was seen in nine patients, eight of whom had multiple injuries. The mortality rate was higher in patients with pulmonary contusion and pneumothorax (p=0.002 and p=0.003, respectively). The PTS and GCS were found to be lower in patients who died in hospital (p<0.001). Prolongation of coagulation parameters and hyperglycemia was more common in the non-survivor group (p=0.005 and p=0.004, respectively). Although thoracoabdominal trauma is not common in childhood, it is an important part of trauma-associated mortality. Multiple injuries, pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, lower GCS, and PTSs can be a sign of serious injuries to which physicians must be alert."

The digestive and especially colonic location of this tumor is rare. Commonly described in elderly patient, their malignancy is unusual. We report the case of a 23-year-old girl, with learning disability, operated in emergency for acute peritonitis. Peroperatively, we discovered a peritonitis secondary to a bulky perforated cecal tumor. We performed a right colectomy and an ileostomy. The posterior margin of the resection was macroscopically involved. The diagnosis of colonic schwannoma was confirmed with immunopathological examination of the surgical specimen. Surgical exploration 4 months later and morphological investigations during 2 years showed stability of the tumoral residue in the right iliac fossa. However, we noticed, on CT scanning control 2 years postoperatively, the appearance of a mesenteric recurrence. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed the unresectability of this mesenteric mass and showed the presence of multiple parietal nodules whose biopsies revealed their neurofibromatous nature. The 4 year follow-up of the patient didn't reveal any complication rather than need to right nephrostomy due to ureter compression by the primary tumoral residue. Colonic schwannoma is a rare disease, commonly described in uncomplicated stages. The learning disability of our patient had favorized the absence of declared symptoms and promoted the evolution of the cecal swhannoma until its perforation. This complication was not described before. Local recurrence has been also rarely reported in the literature. Association with neurofibroma may be hereditary in a context of neurofibromatosis or sporadic. Colonic schwannoma may have polymorphic presentation mimicking malignant tumor in such cases. Not treated in time, it can lead to severe complications, such as tumoral perforation. Surgical resection remains the mainstay treatment. The slow evolutionary genius of schwannoma, even when incompletely resected by necessity, confirms its good prognosis."

To examine the effect of SP, patients were divided into a PCC group and an SP-only group. Missing values of age, sex, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, time from emergency call to hospital arrival, head AIS, chest AIS, abdomen/pelvis AIS, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and ISS were estimated using multiple imputation. In-hospital mortality was analyzed using multivariable analysis, and we undertook a survival analysis. We analyzed 305 patients, 150 (49.2%) in the PCC group and 155 (50.8%) in the SP-only group. The in-hospital mortality rate was 40.7% in the PCC group and 76.8% in the SP-only group. Multivariable analysis after multiple imputation showed an odds ratio of SP for in-hospital mortality 5.34 (95% confidence interval, 2.80-10.18; P < 0.01) compared with PCC. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, SP showed a significant risk of mortality (hazard ratio 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.58-2.95; P < 0.01).

Due to physiological and anatomical changes specific to pregnancy, such as changes in blood pressure and hemoglobin drop, trauma management involves certain complexities. Physical trauma is estimated to cause at least 1 complication in every 12 pregnancies. This study aims to evaluate orthopedic trauma during pregnancy and appreciate the different approaches to circumvent the resultant challenges. We reviewed 55 articles, published on orthopedic trauma during pregnancy between 2011 and 2021. The articles were identified by searching PubMed, google-scholar, Scopus, and Science-Direct. We utilized the search terms: fall in pregnancy, traumas in pregnancy, motor vehicle accident/crash in pregnancy, blunt trauma in pregnancy, pregnant trauma patient, penetrating injury during pregnancy, assault, interpersonal violence in pregnancy, and mortality and pregnancy. According to available reports, after stabilizing the pregnant patient, diagnostic procedures, including radiography, and even gadolinium-based techniques when needed, can be performed to examine extensive trauma. In contrast to elective orthopedic surgery, emergency orthopedic surgeries, including reduction of open fractures, should be performed promptly. Based on our investigation, pregnant women with orthopedic injuries that are severe, or even seemingly less severe, experience significantly increased adverse pregnancy outcomes, which include preterm birth, placental abruption, poor infant condition at birth, infant death, and even maternal death."

The assessment of blush in hepatic and splenic trauma is important for determining the need for emergency hemostatic interventions. However, the frequency and importance of blush in lung contusions are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the frequency of blush in patients with lung contusions and elucidate the relationship between blush and the clinical outcomes of patients with blunt chest trauma. In this retrospective observational study, we enrolled patients with an injury severity score of 16 or higher and a chest abbreviated injury scale (AIS) score of 3 or higher who were admitted to the emergency department of Hokkaido University Hospital from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2016. Blush was defined as active extravasation of an intravascular contrast agent recognized on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. The date of trauma, trauma severity, treatments, and outcomes were obtained from the patients' electronic medical records. During the study period, 83 patients had severe lung contusions and 13 had blush. In-hospital mortality of patients with blush was significantly higher than that of patients without blush (53 vs. 10%, P < 0.001). Patients with blush required thoracic drainage more frequently (100 vs. 71%, P < 0.001) and support through mechanical ventilation more often (100 vs. 64%, P < 0.001) and for a longer duration (median duration, 0 vs. 25 days, P = 0.001) than patients without blush. Our study revealed that blush in lung contusions was not rare and was associated with a high risk of mortality in patients with severe blunt chest trauma. Clinicians should not hesitate to intervene if blush is detected in a lung contusion of a patient with blunt chest trauma."

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic defects are rare, with most cases presenting in childhood. Diagnosis in adulthood is usually incidental or when symptoms develop. We present a case of a strangulated Bochdalek hernia complicated by possible tension pneumothorax and iatrogenic bowel injury in a healthy young male. A 23-year-old Chinese man initially presented with complaints of mild back pain and was discharged with symptomatic treatment. He presented again 3 days later, with dyspnea and left upper back pain and was haemodynamically unstable and hypoxic. A chest x-ray was reported as a moderately large left-sided pneumothorax with herniation of bowel into the left hemithorax. Needle decompression resulted in feculent fluid being aspirated with no resolution of symptoms. The patient required an immediate transfer to the operating theatre for surgical intervention of his left diaphragmatic rupture, complicated by visceral herniation and left tension pneumothorax, with accidental puncture of the herniated bowel. He underwent an emergent laparotomy with requirements for rapid lung isolation and continued aggressive resuscitation. Patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernias may present in adulthood, either incidentally or emergently. In the well adult patient with good reserves, these initial symptoms may be mild, and may be symptomatically treated with no further workup. However, patients may deteriorate rapidly once their compensatory mechanisms are exhausted. This is the first reported case of a patient with diaphragmatic rupture and bowel herniation, complicated by iatrogenic tension pneumothorax. This rare case illustrates the speed at which a diaphragmatic rupture may progress, possible pitfalls and offers insights on how a misdiagnosis may be avoided."

    "abstract": "Large pericardial effusion (LPE) is associated with high mortality. In patients with cardiac tamponade or with suspected bacterial etiology of pericardial effusion, urgent pericardial decompression is necessary. The aim of the present retrospective study was to assess the short-term results of pericardial decompression combined with prolonged drainage in LPE. This study included consecutive patients with LPE who had been treated with pericardial fluid drainage between 2007 and 2017 in the National Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases Research Institute. Echocardiographic examination was used to confirm LPE and the signs of cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis or surgical decompression were combined with pericardial fluid (PF) drainage. Short-term effectiveness of therapy was defined as less than 5 mm of fluid behind the left ventricular posterior wall in echocardiography. The analysis included 74 patients treated with pericardial fluid drainage (33 female and 41 male), mean age 58 years, who underwent pericardial decompression. Out of 74 patients, 26 presented with cardiac tamponade symptoms. Pericardiocentesis was performed in 18 patients and pericardiotomy in 56 patients. Median PF drainage duration was 13 days. In 17 out of 25 patients with neoplastic PF, intrapericardial cisplatin therapy was implemented. In 4 out of 49 patients with non-malignant PF, purulent pericarditis was recognized and intrapericardial fibrinolysis was used. Short-term effectiveness of the therapy was obtained in all of patients. Non-infective complications were noted in 16% of patients and infective ones in 10%. Pericardial decompression combined with prolonged PF drainage was safe and efficient method of LPE treatment."

    "abstract": "Ascaris lumbricoides is a parasitic roundworm that spread through feces-oral routes and is endemic in many nations with poor sanitation. We present a case of a 6-year-old boy who arrived in the emergency room with abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension, absence of bowel sounds, and abdominal tenderness. Abdominal radiographs, ultrasonography, and computed tomography established the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction by A. lumbricoides with associated acute appendicitis and surgical approach scheduled. A massive intraluminal nematode from the jejunum to the ileocecal valve was observed during an exploratory laparotomy. An ileal enterotomy was performed and the worms were removed. The patient was discharged without incident on the 12th day. Ascariasis is the most common helminthic infection worldwide; reaching peak prevalence in children aged 2 to 10. The disease is prevalent in children with environmental and socioeconomic risk factors, causing serious problems such as intestinal obstruction (IO), volvulus, intussusception, and intestinal necrosis. Ascaris lumbricoid is very prevalent in developing countries and should be kept in mind in preschool children with symptoms of sudden acute intestinal obstruction. The diagnosis of intestinal ascariasis can usually be made with plain radiography, barium examinations, and ultrasonography of the abdomen. Other modalities, such as CT, can also be used. Medical treatment of Ascaris infestation is usually successful; however, bowel obstruction may require surgery."

    "abstract": "Intra-abdominal injury due to blunt trauma accounts for 5-10% of all traumatic cases. It usually occurs secondary to motor vehicle collision, pedestrian injury, and falls. Typically these result in injury to solid abdominal organs-liver and spleen, hollow visceral organs, and rarely the abdominal vasculature. Blunt abdominal trauma causing concurrent injury to the hepatic branch of the celiac artery and the associated vein along with gastric laceration is a rare presentation and has a high mortality rate, thereby warranting prompt evaluation. While the initial stabilization should follow Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines, the adherence to nonoperative management or operative care depends upon the severity of the injury and the patient's clinical status. Here, we present an unusual case of gastric and splenic laceration with damage to the hepatic branch of celiac artery, splenic artery, and the associated vein following blunt abdominal trauma in a 12-year-old child following intentional self-harm by crashing a self-inflicted motor vehicle. Despite the negative preoperative radiological finding, the case was managed successfully with the laparotomic correction of the damaged stomach segment, splenectomy, and repair of the damaged artery, and ligation of the transected vein to control hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "The prognosis of thymoma with cardiac tamponade is generally poor. Most of the reported thymomas with cardiac tamponade were type B or type AB (mixed thymoma), and cardiac tamponade due to type A thymoma, which has a better prognosis compared to type B thymoma, is extremely rare. We encountered a case of cardiac tamponade in a 71-year-old male. He visited our emergency department due to exacerbation of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion that lasted for two weeks. Chest imaging revealed a large amount of pericardial fluid and a contrast-enhanced tumor with calcification in the anterior mediastinum. The patient underwent thoracoscopic tumor biopsy and pathological examinations revealed type A thymoma. In this case, long-term disease-free survival (7.5 years) was achieved by multidisciplinary treatment (preoperative chemotherapy, surgical excision, and postoperative radiation therapy), in accordance with the histological type. This case indicates that neoplastic cardiac tamponade, even in elderly patients, should not necessarily be regarded as a terminal cancer and requires a systematic investigation for underlying causes."

We present the case of a 45-year-old female with recent severe COVID-19 infection and early gastrointestinal symptoms who later presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation after initial discharge. She was diagnosed with a large bowel obstruction and underwent urgent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed a stricture of the distal transverse colon. Following segmental resection, the patient experienced resolution of symptoms. We hypothesize that this patient's colonic stricture arose secondary to severe COVID-19-induced bowel inflammation."

    "abstract": "Non-operative management has become increasingly popular in the treatment of renal trauma. While data are robust in blunt mechanisms, the role of non-operative management in penetrating trauma is less clear. Additionally, there is a paucity of data comparing gunshot and stab wounds. A retrospective review of patients admitted to a high-volume level 1 trauma center (Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town) with penetrating abdominal trauma was performed. Patients with renal injuries were identified and compared based on mechanism [gunshot (GSW) vs. stab] and management strategy (operative vs. non-operative). Primary outcomes of interest were mortality and failure of non-operative management. Secondary outcomes of interest were nephrectomy rates, Clavien-Dindo complication rate, hospital length of stay, and overall morbidity rate. A total of 150 patients with renal injuries were identified (82 GSW, 68 stab). Overall, 55.2% of patients required emergent/urgent laparotomy. GSWs were more likely to cause grade V injury and concurrent intra-abdominal injuries (p > 0.05). The success rate of non-operative management was 91.6% (89.9% GSW, 92.8% stab, p = 0.64). The absence of hematuria on point of care testing demonstrated a negative predictive value of 98.4% (95% CI 96.8-99.2%). All but 1 patient who failed non-operative management had associated intra-abdominal injuries requiring surgical intervention. Opening of Gerota's fascia resulted in nephrectomy in 55.6% of cases. There were no statistically significant risk factors for failure of non-operative management identified on univariate logistic regression. NOM of penetrating renal injuries can be safely and effectively instituted in both gunshot and stab wounds with a very low number of patients progressing to laparotomy. Most patients fail NOM for associated injuries. During laparotomy, the opening of Gerota's fascia may lead to increased risk of nephrectomy. Ongoing study with larger populations is required to develop effective predictive models of patients who will fail NOM."

They were managed by urgent pericardiocentesis followed by intermittent drainage of the collected pericardial effusion along with thyroxine replacement to which they responded.

    "abstract": "To investigate the 30-day survival rate of resuscitative and emergency thoracotomies in trauma patients. Moreover, factors that positively influence 30-day survival rates were investigated. A retrospective study of patients (> 16 years), between 2008 and 2020, who underwent a resuscitative or emergency thoracotomy at a level-one trauma center in the Netherlands was conducted. Fifty-six patients underwent a resuscitative (n = 45, 80%) or emergency (n = 11, 20%) thoracotomy. The overall 30-day survival rate was 32% (n = 18), which was 23% after blunt trauma and 72% after penetrating trauma, and which was 18% for the resuscitative thoracotomy and 91% for the emergency thoracotomy. The patients who survived had full neurologic recovery. Factors associated with survival were penetrating trauma (p < 0.001), (any) sign of life (SOL) upon presentation to the hospital (p = 0.005), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15 (p < 0.001) and a thoracotomy in the operating room (OR) (p = 0.018). Every resuscitative thoracotomy after blunt trauma and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole in the pre-hospital phase was futile (0 survivors out of 11 patients), of those patients seven (64%) had concomitant severe neuro-trauma. This study found a 30-day survival rate of 32% for resuscitative and emergency thoracotomies, all with good neurological recovery. Factors associated with survival were related to the trauma mechanism, the thoracotomy indication and response to resuscitation prior to thoracotomy (for instance, if resuscitation enables enough time for safe transport to the operating room, survival chances increase). Resuscitative thoracotomies after blunt trauma in combination with loss of SOL before arrival at the emergency room were in all cases futile, interestingly in nearly all cases due to concomitant neuro-trauma."

    "abstract": "Pneumothorax is a known complication following breast surgery but is likely underappreciated by anesthesiologists. Iatrogenic pneumothorax can be caused by needle injury during local anesthetic injection, surgical damage to the intercostal fascia or pleura, or pulmonary injury from mechanical ventilation. We present two cases of pneumothorax following bilateral mastectomy with bilateral pectoral blocks and immediate breast reconstruction. Both cases occurred at a freestanding ambulatory surgery center in patients with no history of lung disease. One patient was found to have bilateral pneumothoraxes after complaining of shortness of breath and chest pain in the post-operative care unit. The second patient was asymptomatic but found to have a right-sided pneumothorax on a chest X-ray (CXR) that was ordered to rule-out left-sided pneumothorax due to concern of intraoperative breach of the left chest wall. Both patients were treated with chest tubes, transferred to a nearby hospital, and discharged several days later. Anesthesiologists must be aware of this potentially life-threatening complication and consider pneumothorax in the differential diagnosis of perioperative hypoxemia, shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemodynamic collapse in patients undergoing breast surgery. Though traditionally diagnosed via radiograph, pneumothorax can be rapidly diagnosed with ultrasound. Tension pneumothorax should be decompressed immediately with a needle. A clinically significant, non-tension pneumothorax is treated with chest tube placement. Equipment necessary to treat pneumothorax should be available for emergency treatment in facilities wherever breast surgery is performed."

This study assesses the accuracy of after-hour acute trauma radiograph reporting by emergency centre (EC) doctors in an African district hospital. An institutional review board approved retrospective descriptive study over two consecutive weekends in February 2020. The radiologist report on the admission radiographs of adult trauma patients was compared with the initial EC interpretation. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for EC interpretation were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The association between reporting accuracy and anatomical region, mechanism of injury, time of investigation, and the number of abnormalities per radiograph was assessed. 140 radiographs were included, of which 49 (35%) were abnormal. EC doctors recorded (95%CI) 77% (69-84%) accuracy, 38% (25-54%) sensitivity, 97% (91-99%) specificity, 86% (65-95%) PPV and 76% (71-80%) NPV. Performance was associated with the anatomical region (p=0.02), mechanism of injury (p=<0.01) time of day (p=0.04) and the number of abnormalities on the film (p=<0.01). The highest sensitivity was achieved in reports of the appendicular skeleton (42%) and in the setting of simple blunt trauma (62%). Overall accuracy was in line with the range (44%-99%) reported in the international literature. Accurate reporting of acute trauma radiographs is challenging. Key factors impact performance. Further training of junior doctors in this area of clinical practice is recommended. Future work should focus on assessing the impact of such training on reporting performance."

A pre/post-educational intervention on a convenience sample of rural North American EMS paramedics and nurses. Measurement of location and estimated depth of placement of needle thoracostomy with traditional landmark technique was completed and then repeated using handheld ultrasound following a training session on thoracic ultrasound and correct placement of NT. A total of 30 EMS practitioners participated. Seven were female (23.3%). There was a higher frequency of dangerous structures underlying the chosen location with the landmark technique 9/60 (15%) compared to the ultrasound technique 1/60 (1.7%) (p = 0.08). Mean time-to-site-selection for the landmark technique was shorter than the ultrasound technique at 10.7 s (range 3.35-45 s) vs. 19.9 s (range 7.8-50 s), respectively (p < 0.001). There was a lower proportion of correct location selection for the landmark technique 40/60 (66.7%) when compared to the ultrasound technique 51/60 (85%) (p = 0.019). With ultrasound, there was less variance between the estimated and measured depth of the pleural space with a mean difference of 0.033 cm (range 0-0.5 cm) when ultrasound was used as compared to a mean difference of 1.0375 cm (range 0-6 cm) for the landmark technique (95% CI for the difference 0.73-1.27 cm; p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Pericardial tamponade requires timely diagnosis and management. It carries a high mortality rate. This review incorporates available evidence to clarify misconceptions regarding the clinical presentation, while providing an in-depth expert guide on bedside echocardiography. It also details the decision-making strategy for emergency management including pericardiocentesis, along with pre- and peri-procedural pearls and pitfalls. Pericardial effusions causing tamponade arise from diverse etiologies across acute and sub-acute time courses. The most frequently reported symptom is dyspnea. The classically taught Beck's triad (which includes hypotension) does not appear commonly. Echocardiographic findings include: a pericardial effusion (larger size associated with tamponade), diastolic right ventricular collapse (specific), systolic right atrial collapse (sensitive), a plethoric non-collapsible inferior vena cava (sensitive), and sonographic pulsus paradoxus. Emergent pericardiocentesis is warranted by hemodynamic instability, impending deterioration, or cardiac arrest. Emergent surgical indications include type A aortic dissection causing hemopericardium, ventricular free wall rupture after acute myocardial infarction, severe chest trauma, and iatrogenic hemopericardium when bleeding cannot be controlled percutaneously. Pre-procedure management includes blood products for patients with traumatic hemopericardium; gentle intravenous fluids to hypotensive, hypovolemic patients with consideration for vasoactive medications; treatment of anticoagulation, coagulopathies, and anemia. Positive-pressure ventilation and intravenous sedation can lower cardiac output and should be avoided if possible. Optimal location for echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis is the largest, shallowest fluid pocket with no intervening vital structures. Patient positioning to prevent hypoxia and liberal amounts of local anesthesia can facilitate patients remaining still. Safe needle guidance and confirmation of catheter placement is achieved using low-depth sonographic views, injection of agitated saline, and evaluation of initial aspirate for hemorrhage. Pericardial fluid should be drained slowly to avoid pericardial decompression syndrome. An understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, echocardiographic findings, and time-sensitive management of pericardial tamponade is essential for emergency physicians."

We performed a retrospective observational study comparing patients undergoing CT scans for trauma during the 1st and 2nd lockdown periods compared to corresponding prepandemic months. During two lockdown periods, public places such as restaurants, libraries, parks, and shops across the province were shut down. Government-led messaging advised that people should stay at home and practice social distancing. The rate of trauma-initiated CT scans and the proportion of different types of traumas were compared between time periods. There was no significant difference in overall trauma-initiated CT scans between the prepandemic and pandemic levels. Motor vehicle collision (MVC) cases decreased from 18.2% to 15.6% during the first lockdown period (p = 0.049) and also reduced from 29.1% to 25.2% during the second lockdown period (p = 0.013). Trauma from falls increased from 19.1% to 27.5% (p = 0.036) during the first lockdown, despite no significant change during the 2nd lockdown. Furthermore, the percentage of stab injuries increased from 25.0% to 38.9% while blunt trauma decreased from 68.5% to 54.3% during two lockdowns (p = 0.015).

CT occult injuries were identified by MRI and clinical exam, with MRI identifying all unstable injuries. Sixty-nine (2.0%) of patients had CS injury without acute CT abnormality. Of these, 11 (0.3%) required surgery and were considered unstable. All patients who required surgery had a neurologic deficit. Negative predictive value (NPV) of CT for unstable CS injury was 99.7%. The combination of acute CT findings and neurologic deficit ruled out unstable CS injury with 100% NPV. In the GLF population, CT alone rules out unstable CS injury with high, but not perfect NPV.

Rarely, Meckel's diverticula have been found to harbor various tumors, which go unnoticed until later in their course. The clinical presentation varies among each individual, and tumors have often metastasized or caused diverticular rupture at the time of diagnosis. This is a case of a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of alcohol abuse and asthma who presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. He denied any fever, chills, chest pain, nausea, changes in urinary patterns, recent travel, or sick contacts. He is a non-smoker but has been a heavy drinker for many years. On physical exam, he was found to have diffuse abdominal tenderness with pain greatest in the epigastric region and no bowel sounds. He was afebrile but tachycardic at 112 bpm, hypertensive at 168/98 mmHg, and tachypneic at 38 bpm. Labs showed a markedly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin and platelet count, as well as metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate levels. Abdominal CT showed a mechanical small bowel obstruction with unclear etiology. Of note was a 7.2 cm thick-walled collection in the right lower quadrant having no clear communication with any bowel loops. Despite aggressive hydration and supportive care, his abdominal exam continued to worsen, prompting an exploratory laparotomy. During the laparotomy, a perforated MD with frank succus was found. On pathology, the affected segment of the bowel revealed a CD117 and CD34 positive spindle cell gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with mild cytological atypia, no necrosis, and no regional lymph node involvement. Cultures of peritoneal fluid were positive for Klebsiella oxytoca, and the patient was started on meropenem and doxycycline. The patient showed significant improvement with the appropriate administration of antibiotics and was eventually discharged to follow-up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient for further management and monitoring of his GIST tumor. This case is unique as there are only a few reported cases of patients developing GIST inside of MDs. Despite the high five-year survival rate of typically localized GIST tumors, the complications (such as perforation in the case of our patient) caused by tumor growth inside a MD are detrimental if not diagnosed promptly. Not only does perforation increase the risk of metastasis but also the risk of peritonitis and other complications. This case calls for more research on standardization of care for patients who have MD to prevent malignant transformations as well as potential prophylactic excision of incidental MD findings in adult patients."

The main risk factors associated with intra-operative mortality were related to seasonality (winter and summer), patient age (older than 9 years), distance from the hospital, the presence of a strangulating lesion, and the bowel segment affected (small intestine). Furthermore, the main factors associated with mortality during hospitalization were the characteristics of the lesions (strangulating) and the differences between surgical centers. The models generated in this study have good predictive value and use only reliable and easily obtainable variables. The most reliable characteristics are those related to the type of colic and the location of the lesion."

    "abstract": "This research aimed to establish a scoring system for selecting candidates for urgent angioembolization (AE). Patients with blunt trauma were retrospectively identified in a nationwide trauma registry. Patients aged ≥ 15 years with a systolic blood pressure of ≥90 mmHg were included. These individuals were then categorized into development and validation cohorts based on the date of admission. Next, an eight-point scaled system was developed using odds ratios obtained from the multivariate analysis of patients' clinical factors on their arrival at the hospital, with the implementation of urgent AE as a dependent variable. The development cohort and validation cohort included 158,192 and 116,941 patients, respectively, and 3296 (2.1%) patients in the development cohort and 2,550 (2.2%) patients in the validation cohort underwent urgent AE. The frequency of transfusion within 24 h after arrival and the Injury Severity Score were similar between the two cohorts (16,867 [10.7%] vs. 11,222 [9.6%] and 10 [9-18] vs. 10 [9-17], respectively). The number of patients who were discharged and hospital-free days were comparable between the two cohorts (139,436 [94.4%] vs. 106,107 [95.6%] and 72 [53-84] vs. 73 [57-84] days, respectively). The probabilities and the observed rates of urgent AE increased proportionally from 2% at a score of ≤ 3 to almost 15% at a score of ≥ 7. In terms of predictive factors, no significant interaction was noted. The Trauma-Angio scoring system can be used as a trigger to suggest the possibility of urgent AE. 20090087, 31st July 2009."

    "abstract": "To evaluate previously published predictive survival models in a population of horses undergoing colic surgery in the midwestern United States. Retrospective cohort study; single referral hospital. A total of 260 horses met the inclusion criteria. Medical records of horses undergoing surgical treatment for colic were reviewed. Previously published models were applied to cohort data to predict outcome. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy for prediction of short-term survival were calculated. Single-variable and multivariable models performed similarly for prediction of survival, with a mean 79% sensitivity (range: 44%-94%), 48% specificity (range: 22%-83%), 63% PPV (range: 56%-72%), 73% NPV (range: 60%-83%), and 64% accuracy (range: 59%-72%). Blood lactate ≤6 mmol/l and the colic severity score (CSS) were highly sensitive for prediction of survival; however, both had poor specificity. Single-variable and multivariable predictive models did not perform as well for prediction of survival in the study cohort compared to original reports, suggesting that population-specific factors contribute to patient survival. Predictive models of survival developed in one population may be less reliable when used to predict outcome in horses undergoing colic surgery from an independent population. Additional model testing and refinement using data from multiple surgical centers could be considered to improve prediction of outcome for horses undergoing laparotomy for treatment of colic."

We describe our initial experiences of PHBT in a ground-based emergency medical service (EMS), where the transfusion protocol covers both traumatic and nontraumatic hemorrhaging patients. A descriptive retrospective analysis was performed on the records of all the patients receiving red blood cells, freeze-dried plasma, or both during prehospital care from September 2016 to December 2020. The delays of PHBT and the effects on patients' vital signs were analyzed and reported as the median and interquartile range (IQR) and analyzed using a Wilcoxon Signed rank test. 65 patients received prehospital blood product transfusions (PHBT), 29 (45%) were non-traumatic, and 36 (55%) traumatic. The main two reasons for PHBT were blunt trauma (n = 30, 46%) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (n = 20, 31%). The median time from the emergency call to the start of PHBT was 54 min (IQR 38), and the transfusion began on a median of 61 min (IQR 42) before arrival at the hospital. The median systolic blood pressure improved from a median 76.5 mmHg (IQR 36.5) before transfusion to a median of 116.60 mmHg (IQR 26.5) (p < 0.001) on arrival to the hospital. No transfusion-related severe adverse events were noted. Starting PHBT in ground-based EMS is a feasible and viable option. The PHBT began significantly earlier than it would have started on arrival to the hospital, and it seems to be safe and improve patients' physiology.

    "abstract": "The Clostridium species is a gram positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped microbe that is known to produce many toxins. Most infections by the Clostridium species involve C. botulinum, C. difficile, and C. perfringens. However, other types of Clostridium species are also clinically relevant, such as C. septicum and C. tertium. We discuss a case of a 79-year-old patient with a past medical history of prostate cancer and alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital after being found down. They were admitted to the ICU for septic shock, and initial blood cultures grew C. septicum, C. tertium, and E. coli. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed pneumoperitoneum and a loculated pericolic fluid collection concerning for colon perforation. Initially the patient had a benign abdominal exam, but later developed significant distention and tenderness that required an emergent exploratory laparotomy and total abdominal colectomy. The patient was found to have three separate colon perforations, and no malignancy on histopathology. C. septicum is a highly virulent pathogen, and there are several cases reporting C. septicum-associated endocarditis, aortitis, and endophthalmitis. It is also associated with colon and hematologic malignancies and neutropenia. Common risk factors for C. tertium include immunocompromised status, neutropenia, hematologic malignancy, exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics, cirrhosis, and intestinal mucosal damage. It seems to have low virulence and low mortality when treated correctly. It is important that any patient found to have Clostridium bacteremia be evaluated for a gastrointestinal source and treated promptly and appropriately."

We report an unusual case of HPVG in association with the drip rate of enteral nutrition (EN) after laparoscopic-assisted radical total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. A 66-year-old woman with gastric cancer was admitted to our hospital. She was diagnosed with cirrhosis of unknown cause and underwent radical total gastrectomy. The rapid infusion of postoperative early EN caused the intestine to expand quickly and injured intestinal mucosa. Hepatic portal venous gas and pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) were discovered subsequently. Early detection and timely effective intervention eventually and completely cured the patient; meanwhile, we avoided unnecessary exploratory laparotomy. Hepatic portal venous gas and PI after radical total gastrectomy can be cured with careful conservative management; the drip rate of EN should be tightly controlled and monitored during treatment after radical total gastrectomy."

The use of a Foley catheter as a replacement catheter in a Stamm gastrostomy is indicated in the absence of dedicated gastrostomy feeding tubes; however, this approach has been associated with many morbidities. In this report, an unusual case of an infant who underwent a major operation due to coiled spring jejunal intussusception caused by Foley catheter migration is described. A 6-month-old neurologically impaired premature female patient was admitted to the emergency unit with respiratory distress, nonbilious vomiting and an ineffective gastrostomy feeding tube. Her history revealed that, at the age of 2 months, she had undergone Stamm gastrostomy for enteral feeding with a Pezzer catheter. However, at the age of 5 months, the Pezzer catheter became dislodged and was replaced with a Foley catheter. The patient subsequently underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy due to intestinal obstruction. During the operation, retrograde coiled spring jejunal intussusceptions with multiple areas of local necrosis and perforations were observed. Resection of the affected jejunal segment and end-to-end anastomosis were performed. The postoperative period was long and very demanding due to the presence of several comorbidities. To our knowledge, this is the first operative demonstration of coiled spring intussusception. This case report aims to increase clinical awareness of the possibility of coiled spring intussusception following the use of Foley catheter in a gastrostomy and the difficulties encountered in the surgical course of a premature infant."

The aim of this study was to report incidence of severe hypoxemia ( PaO2 < 60 mmHg) in horses undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy and identify potential risk factors for this complication. A single center retrospective cross sectional designed was used. Clinical data of 714 horses undergoing general anesthesia for emergency explorative laparotomy were reviewed. A backward stepwise elimination procedure was used to determine the final multivariable logistic regression model; all covariables with univariable P-values <.25 were incorporated, with retention of covariables with Wald P-values <.05 at each step, in order to determine which explanatory variables would be included in the final model. The overall incidence of severe hypoxemia in our population was 15.3%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that increasing body weight (odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.01, P = .002), colon torsion (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3-6.8, P = .006), increased dead space ventilation (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.09, P ≤ .001), shorter time between induction of anesthesia and collection of arterial blood gas samples (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.98-0.99, P ≤ .001) and intratracheal aerosolized salbutamol (OR 13.5, 95% CI 7.6-24, P ≤ .001) were associated with the outcome. The incidence of hypoxemia found in our study was in line with previous literature. Increasing body weight, colon torsion and shorter time between the time of induction of anesthesia and collection of arterial blood gas samples represented risk factors for hypoxemia."

    "abstract": "Tracheal masses are rare in occurrence, but could lead to complications depending on the speed of growth, duration and degree of obstruction. Some of the complications are recurrent pneumonia and air trapping resulting in increased intrathoracic pressure. The latter phenomenon can result in obstruction of the venous return and pneumothorax. We are reporting a rare presentation of bilateral pneumothorax (presumed tensioned) in a young patient with a distal obstructive tracheal tumor. In the emergency department (ED) the patient was in respiratory distress and was found to have extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the neck, chest, and abdominal wall with hypotension. Respiratory failure from bilateral tension pneumothorax was suspected and the patient was intubated with simultaneous bilateral thoracostomy. These measures did not improve the patient's ventilation and oxygenation status. Further fiberoptic investigation revealed a distal tracheal obstructive mass. An emergency surgical intervention was required to remove the tumor. We recommend considering alternative pathologies, such as an obstructive tracheal tumor, in a patient with respiratory distress. They should especially be considered when oxygenation and ventilation are difficult, particularly when endotracheal intubation and/or tube thoracostomy fail to improve the symptoms. A high index of suspicion and a timely multidisciplinary team approach are essential when managing the life-threatening presentation of a patient with a distal tracheal tumor."

During her hospital stay, she developed abdominal distention followed by a fever and a four-point decrease in hemoglobin. A non-contrasted abdominopelvic CT scan was ordered which showed a very large retroperitoneal hematoma adjacent to the right colon with subtle active bleeding. Selective angioembolization of a distal segment of the right colic artery was performed by Interventional Radiology (IR) to achieve hemostasis and hemodynamic stability. Due to the persistent and worsening abdominal distention, a CT scan with contrast was ordered which clearly showed a submucosal hematoma in the region of the right colon extending from the hepatic flexure to the cecum. The hematoma was completely obstructing the proximal and mid ascending colon leading to a large bowel obstruction. Exploration of the abdomen showed severe bowel dilation, and frank ischemia of the hepatic flexure of the colon. Right hemicolectomy with primary ileocolonic anastomosis to evacuate the right retroperitoneal hematoma was subsequently performed. The patient was discharged on post-operative day 16 with no major complications."

Opportunities for skill sustainment have reduced due to the cessation of combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and lack of military-relevant trauma in UK civilian practice. A voluntary, anonymous online survey study was sent to all UK Defence Medical Services (DMS) surgical consultants and higher surgical trainees in Trauma and Orthopaedics, Plastic and Reconstructive, and General and Vascular surgical specialties (three largest surgical specialties in the DMS in terms of numbers). The online questionnaire tool included 20 questions using multiple choice and free text to assess respondents' subjective feelings of preparedness for deployment as surgeons for trauma patients. There were 71 of 108 (66%) responses. Sixty-four (90%) respondents were regular armed forces, and 46 (65%) worked in a Major Trauma Centre (MTC). Thirty-three (47%) had never deployed on operations in a surgical role. Nineteen (27%) felt they had sufficient exposure to penetrating trauma. When asked 'How well do you feel your training and clinical practice prepares you for a surgical deployment?' on a scale of 1-10, trainees scored significantly lower than consultants (6 (IQR 4-7) vs 8 (IQR 7-9), respectively; p<0.001). There was no significant difference in scores between regular and reservists, or between those working at an MTC versus non-MTC. Respondents suggested high-volume trauma training and overseas trauma centre fellowships, simulation, cadaveric and live-tissue training would help their preparedness. There was a feeling among a sample of UK DMS consultants and trainees that better preparedness is required for them to deploy confidently as a surgeon for combat casualties. The responses suggest that UK DMS surgical training requires urgent attention if current surgeons are to be ready for their role on deployed operations."

    "abstract": "Whether extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is indicated for patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) remains unclear. Pulmonary embolism with PEA is a good candidate for ECPR; however, PEA can sometimes include an aortic disease and intracranial haemorrhage, with extremely poor neurological outcomes, and can thus not be used as a suitable candidate. We began employing an ECPR strategy that utilised a hybrid emergency room (ER) to perform computed tomography (CT) before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) induction from January 2020. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this ECPR strategy. Medical records of patients who transferred to our hybrid ER and required ECPR for PEA between January 2020 and November 2021 were reviewed. Twelve consecutive patients (median age, 67 [range, 57-73] years) with PEA requiring ECPR were identified in our hybrid ER. Among these patients, nine were diagnosed using an initial CT scan (intracranial haemorrhage (3); cardiac tamponade due to aortic dissection (3); aortic rupture (2); and cardiac rupture (1)), and unnecessary ECMO was avoided. The remaining three patients underwent ECPR, and two of them survived with favourable neurological outcomes. Patients not indicated for ECPR were excluded before ECMO induction. Our ECPR strategy that involved the utilisation of a hybrid ER may be useful for the exclusion of patients with PEA not indicated for ECPR and decision making."

When nonsurgical management fails, urgent cardiac surgery is required. The standard surgical approach is usually through full sternotomy. However, we propose a less invasive and equally effective technique with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This single-center retrospective study in a tertiary hospital identified all patients requiring surgical intervention due to iatrogenic cardiac perforation over a period of 5 years. Patients were grouped by surgical approach, being either sternotomy or VATS. Primary endpoints were operating time, length of ICU stay, hospital stay, 30-day mortality, and all-round mortality. Twenty-five patients were identified: 11 in the sternotomy group and 14 in the VATS-group. Preoperative baseline characteristics were equal. Significant difference was found for 30-day mortality (p < .05). There was no difference for the other endpoints. VATS is a promising alternative to standard sternotomy for iatrogenic cardiac perforations after invasive cardiac procedures."

A 70-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a history of bilateral painful scrotal swelling for 7 days with fever and abdominal pain for 3 days. On his general examination, he was septic with necrotic patches in the perineum and bilateral scrotum. Imaging revealed soft tissue gas and collections in scrotum extending to the right retroperitoneum with massive collection suggestive of retroperitoneal abscess. Following resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics, immediate exploratory laparotomy was done to drain the retroperitoneal abscess followed by debridement of Fournier's gangrene. The patient remained well on follow up. Fournier gangrene is a fulminant polymicrobial infection of the perineum, scrotum and penis which when complicated by retroperitoneal extension, has a very high mortality. Majority of patients have an immunocompromised condition. Early diagnosis with prompt surgical drainage and debridement (within 6 hours) significantly reduces the mortality. High index of suspicion, careful clinical examination and timely use of imaging is crucial for early diagnosis of this rare but fatal complication of FG. Furthermore, adequate resuscitation with prompt surgical intervention is the key for a favorable outcome."

Tasks with highest self-reported increase in confidence were related to (1) diagnosis (tension pneumothorax, oxygenator failure, and ventricular tachycardia), (2) fluid administration and (3) early and efficient mobilization for ECPR, with less reported confidence increase with technical skills More than 90% of participants provided a task or behavior they would implement if a specific emergency was encountered in real-life following simulation training. Real-life application occurred following simulations with participants reporting direct impact of training on their ability to perform the skill efficiently and correctly. Implementation of ECMO multidisciplinary simulations provides structured opportunities for the team to learn and practice ECMO skills together in scenarios they may encounter without surgical presence. Ensuring competency of providers through implementation of such a program may improve patient safety through enhanced team communication, knowledge, and hands-on experience."

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) or Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a rare, autoimmune vasculitis usually affecting small and medium-sized blood vessels in its later phases. It is a diffuse, systemic, multisystem disease that is reported to present with gastrointestinal manifestations but very rarely as an acute abdomen secondary to eosinophilic peritonitis. A 28-year-old relatively healthy male with a pre-existing diagnosis of inactive pulmonary sarcoidosis presented to the emergency department with an acute abdomen. After an exploratory laparotomy, multi-specialty involvement, and extensive investigations to exclude other differentials, a diagnosis of EGPA was made. The patient was treated with systemic glucocorticoids initially, followed by a tapering course of steroids and anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibodies as maintenance upon remission. EGPA can manifest in a myriad of ways including an acute abdomen, and medical treatment is useful in managing this presentation. Surgeons should be aware of the atypical causes of acute abdomen and should routinely broaden their differential diagnosis to include medical pathologies."

    "abstract": "Background In the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of full personal protective equipment (PPE) is advocated for patients undergoing emergency surgery in whom the infection status is unknown. This study aims to determine whether PPE has any influence on the rate of surgical site infection (SSI) in patients undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy. Methodology Medical records of operated emergency cases in the general surgery department from 1st April 2020 to 24th February 2021 were studied. The surgeries done were divided into two groups: those done with full PPE (group A) and those done without full PPE (group B). The various parameters studied were the patient demography, presence of comorbidities, diagnosis, surgery done, class of surgery performed, the use of PPE, the post-operative presence, and type of SSI. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Chi-squared test was used to find the association of SSI with the use of PPE. Fisher's exact test was used to explore the association between SSI with various comorbidities, surgery performed, and the class of surgery performed. Results A total of 126 patients underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy during the study period. A total of 61 patients were in group A and 65 patients in group B. A significant association was noted between the use of full PPE and the development of SSI (p = 0.032). Diabetes mellitus, history of alcohol intake, and the class of surgery performed were found to be significantly associated with the development of SSI. Conclusion A significant association in the occurrence of SSI with the use of full PPE was observed."

    "title": "Cardiac tamponade - an unexpected \"long COVID-19\" complication.",
    "abstract": "Year 2020 has been a cornerstone in medical research due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The process of understanding the condition brought to light certain organ involvement like pulmonary or kidney damage or endocrine disbalances, while connection to other types of organ impairment remain unclear. SARS-CoV-2 has previously been incriminated in cardiac involvement, ranging from mild symptoms to more severe occurrences such as myocarditis, arrythmias or heart failure, thus complicating the acute-phase management and worsening patients' prognosis. Despite being reported as an acute manifestation in critical COVID-19, cardiac tamponade seems to also occur as a \"long- COVID19\" complication. The latter is a distinct yet unclear entity associated with remanent fatigue or cough, but more severe sequelae like vasculitis or polyneuropathy can occsur. We report the case of a 42-year-old patient admitted in the intensive care unit for severe respiratory and renal dysfunction one month after an initial mild episode of COVID-19. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission was negative. Initial imaging through CT and heart ultrasound revealed the presence of pericardial effusion but no signs of tamponade were initially obvious. Twelve hours later, the patient's state deteriorated with cardiocirculatory failure and signs of obstructive shock. Agents responsible for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) such as influenza A and B, adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, coxsackie virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae or parainfluenza viruses were ruled out. Surprisingly, RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 came back positive, although the initial test was negative. Repeated imaging confirmed massive circumferential pericardial effusion for which emergency pericardiocentesis was performed. Fluid was an exudate and histopathology reported chronic inflammation. RT-PCR testing for Mycoplasma tuberculosis in the pericardial tissue came back negative. The case is to our knowledge among the first to report cardiac tamponade one month after mild COVID-19 infection. The aim of this case report is to raise awareness in the medical community on the possibility of severe complications targeting major organs in the long-COVID-19 phase."

    "abstract": "Data on how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected consultations in ophthalmic departments are sparse. To examine the epidemiology of ophthalmic consultations in a large pediatric emergency medicine department (PED) during the first nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in Israel. The database of a tertiary pediatric medical center was retrospectively reviewed for patients aged < 18 years who attended the PED from 17 March to 30 April 2020 (first COVID-19 lockdown) and the corresponding period in 2019. Background, clinical, and disease-related data were collected from the medical charts and compared between groups. The study included 757 PED visits. There were no significant differences in demographics between the groups. The 2020 period was characterized by a decrease in PED visits (by 52%), increase in arrivals during late afternoon and evening (P = 0.013), decrease in visits of older children (age 5-10 year), and proportional increase in younger children (age 1-5 years) (P = 0.011). The most common diagnoses overall and during each period was trauma followed by conjunctivitis and eyelid inflammation. The mechanisms of trauma differed (P = 0.002), with an increase in sharp trauma and decrease in blunt trauma in 2020 (P < 0.001 for both). In 2020, 95% of traumatic events occurred in the home compared to 54% in 2019 (P < 0.001). Parents need to learn appropriate preventive and treatment measures to prevent serious and long-term ophthalmic injury while minimizing their exposure to the COVID-19. PEDs and ophthalmic pediatric clinics should consider increasing use of telemedicine and the availability of more senior physicians as consultants during such times."

    "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health issue. This study aims to characterize IPV-related injuries in trauma patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) who required hospitalization. Trauma registries of two Level 1 trauma centers were searched for assault-related ED visits by adults reporting \"abuse\" over 3 and 5 years to identify IPV victims. Imaging and electronic medical records were reviewed for demographics, injury type, hospital stay, and previous or subsequent presentations for presumed IPV. Twenty-nine of 18,465 (0.2%) individuals seen on the trauma service had reported IPV. Majority were women (90%, mean age 37) and Caucasian (69%), over 50% had psychiatric or substance use comorbidities, and 45% reported prior IPV. Blunt trauma (22/29) was more common than penetrating trauma. Soft tissue injuries dominated when including both radiologic and non-radiologic findings. Excluding two patients who were not imaged, most frequent injuries identified on imaging were to the head/face (14/27), followed by the chest (9/27; mainly rib fractures), upper extremity and abdomen (7/27 each). All spinal fractures involved the upper lumbar spine. Synchronous injuries to multiple body regions were common, particularly craniofacial and upper extremity. Twenty-eight of 29 patients scored a grade 3-4 on the IPV severity grading scale. Eight (28%) patients required intensive care unit -level care. One patient passed. Four (14%) patients had prior IPV-related ED presentations. While craniofacial and soft tissue injuries dominate, IPV can also result in serious thoracoabdominal, extremity and spinal injuries, even death. Multisystem injuries are common with synchronous craniofacial and upper extremity injuries being the most common combination."

    "abstract": "Small studies have suggested left ventricular (LV) rapid pacing has similar safety and efficacy to conventional right ventricular (RV) rapid pacing in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). However, there are limited data on the comparative rates of tamponade. The study compared the rate of cardiac tamponade between LV and RV-pacing during TAVI. Between 2008 and 2021, 1226 consecutive patients undergoing transfemoral or transaxillary TAVI were included. 470(38.3%) patients had TAVI deployment with RV-pacing and 756(61.7%) with LV-pacing. The primary outcome was the frequency and cause of cardiac tamponade. Secondary outcomes included efficacy, procedure duration and crossover rates. There was a trend to less tamponade with LV-pacing, which did not reach statistical significance [11(2.3%) vs 11(1.5%);P = 0.27]. There was no significant difference in the frequency of tamponade due to annular tear [4(0.9%) vs 9(1.2%);P = 0.59] or LV free-wall perforation [1(0.2%) vs 2(0.3%);P = 0.86]. The frequency of tamponade due to RV perforation was significantly lower in the LV-pacing group [0 vs 6(2.3%);P < 0.005)]. Two patients with tamponade due to RV perforation required emergency sternotomy of whom one died. Deployment success was similar (99% vs 99.6%;P=NS). Procedure duration was shorter with LV-pacing (70 vs 80 mins;P < 0.005). Crossover to RV-pacing was low (0.9%). There were no embolizations caused by loss-of-capture in either group. LV-pacing appears equally efficacious and is associated with a lower risk of tamponade due to RV perforation caused by the temporary pacing wire. LV-pacing was not associated with an increased risk of tamponade due to LV free-wall perforation."

    "title": "A novel in-plane technique ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis via subcostal approach.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid or blood, fills the pericardial space, and causes hemodynamic compromise due to compression of the heart. It is a potentially life-threatening condition, that requires rapid recognition and immediate treatment. Formerly, blind or surgical techniques were used, and it is associated with complications. Medical technology development has enabled us to perform the procedure safely, with the assistance of ultrasound devices. This article will highlight the novel use of an in-plane subcostal technique, as a safe option for pericardiocentesis in cardiac tamponade. A 50-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with shortness of breath and shock. He was intubated for respiratory distress. His bedside echocardiography showed cardiac tamponade. Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis was carried out using an in-plane technique, at the subcostal region, with a high-frequency linear ultrasound transducer. This particular method provided full visualization of needle trajectory throughout the procedure. It was successfully completed with no complications and patient's hemodynamic status improved post-procedure. He was successfully discharged on day 13. The in-plane subcostal pericardiocentesis is a safe, and simple approach that can be performed in the ED for patients with cardiac tamponade. We recommend this new in-plane method, with high-frequency linear transducer at the subcostal area as an alternative when cardiac window for other approaches cannot be visualized."

    "abstract": "In the setting of acute trauma where identification of critical injuries is time-sensitive, a portable chest radiograph is broadly accepted as an initial diagnostic test for identifying benign and life-threatening pathologies and guiding further imaging and interventions. This article describes chest radiographic findings associated with various injuries resulting from blunt chest trauma and compares the efficacy of the chest radiograph in these settings with computed tomography (CT). Common chest radiographic findings in blunt thoracic injuries will be reviewed to improve radiologic identification, expedite management, and improve trauma morbidity and mortality. This article discusses demographic information, mechanism of specific injuries, common imaging findings, imaging pearls, and pitfalls and exhibits several classic imaging findings in blunt chest trauma. Thoracic structures commonly injured in blunt trauma that will be discussed in this article include vasculature structures (aortic trauma), the heart (cardiac contusion, pericardial effusion), the esophagus (esophageal perforation), pleural space and airways (pneumothorax, hemothorax, bronchial injury), lungs (pulmonary contusion), the diaphragm (diaphragmatic rupture), and the chest wall (flail chest). Chest radiography plays an important role in the initial evaluation of blunt chest trauma. While CT imaging has a higher sensitivity than chest radiography, it remains a valuable tool due to its ability to provide rapid diagnostic information in time-sensitive trauma situations and is ubiquitously available in the trauma bay. Familiarity with the gamut of injuries that may occur as well as identification of the associated chest radiograph findings can aid in timely diagnoses and prompt management in the setting of acute blunt chest trauma."

    "abstract": "Delayed pneumothorax can cause an emergency room visit and be life-threatening in case of tension pneumothorax after transthoracic needle biopsy. We hypothesized that most delayed pneumothoraces are diagnosed by later enlargement of occult pneumothorax due to the low diagnostic accuracy of a chest X-ray. Lung ultrasound is a highly accurate tool for detection of pneumothorax. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound for prediction of delayed pneumothorax on chest X-ray. This prospective pilot study was performed between April 2020 and July 2020 in Chungnam National University Hospital. The participants underwent chest X-rays and lung ultrasound before, immediately after, and 3 h after transthoracic needle biopsy, respectively. The presence or absence of lung sliding at each anterior BLUE-point on an ultrasound and pneumothorax on a chest X-ray was recorded. Pneumothorax occurred in 17 (35.4%) participants, and three of them underwent chest tube replacement. Of the 17 (35.4%) cases of pneumothorax, five participants (10.4%) were diagnosed with delayed pneumothorax. Three out of five participants showed loss of lung sliding on lung ultrasound before the diagnosis of delayed pneumothorax. Therefore, the sensitivity of lung sliding on lung ultrasound for early detection of delayed pneumothorax was 60%. Two undetected cases were asymptomatic, and the pneumothoraces were exceedingly small and recovered spontaneously. Thus, sensitivity for detection of clinically meaningful delayed pneumothorax requiring chest tube replacement was 100% (2/2). Lung ultrasound can probably predict clinically meaningful delayed pneumothorax after transthoracic needle lung biopsy."

If not recognized promptly, this can rapidly progress to respiratory distress, mediastinal shift, and hemodynamic compromise. Initial clinical presentation and imaging findings closely mirror those of tension pneumothorax, confounding diagnosis and potentially leading to unnecessary interventions with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Here, we present a case of an elderly female who presented with a non-traumatic tension gastrothorax and a review of key imaging features and strategies to aid in recognition and accurate diagnosis of this emergent clinical entity."

Most of these injuries are caused by gunshots or stab wounds however the incidence of nail-gun injuries is rising due to their availability and widespread use. Cardiac injuries caused by nail-guns are often self-inflicted. These injuries almost always require operative management with a sternotomy or thoracotomy. This case report describes a 47-year-old male with two self-inflicted nail-gun wounds to the chest. He presented in a stable condition and subsequently underwent an emergency sternotomy to repair a penetrating cardiac injury. We highlight our diagnostic and operative approach to this injury and present a contemporary narrative review of similar cases. Almost all cases of penetrating trauma caused by nail-gun injuries require urgent surgery. Some cases require the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. In this case, the use of the Medtronic® urchin apical suction device, usually reserved for off pump cardiac surgery, facilitated exposure and repair of the lateral wall of the left ventricle."

    "abstract": "Tension pneumothorax following trauma is a life-threatening emergency and radiological investigation is normally discouraged prior to treatment in traditional trauma doctrines such as ATLS. Some trauma patients may be physiologically stable enough for diagnostic imaging and occult tension pneumothorax is discovered radiologically. We assessed the outcomes of these patients and compared them with those with clinical diagnosis of tension pneumothorax prior to imaging. A multicentre civilian-military collaborative network of six major trauma centres in the UK collected observational data from adult patients who had a diagnosis of traumatic tension pneumothorax during a 33-month period. Patients were divided into 'radiological' (diagnosis following CT/CXR) or 'clinical' (no prior CT/CXR) groups. The effect of radiological diagnosis on survival was analysed using multivariable logistic regression that included the covariates of age, gender, comorbidities and Injury Severity Score. There were 133 patients, with a median age of 41 (IQR 24-61); 108 (81%) were male. Survivors included 49 of 59 (83%) in the radiological group and 59 of 74 (80%) in the clinical group (p=0.487). Multivariable logistic regression showed no significant association between radiological diagnosis and survival (OR 2.40, 95% CI 0.80 to 7.95; p=0.130). There was no significant difference in mortality between the groups. Radiological imaging may be appropriate for selected trauma patients at risk of tension pneumothorax if they are considered haemodynamically stable. Trauma patients may be physiologically stable enough for radiological imaging but have occult tension pneumothorax because they did not have the typical clinical presentation. The historical dogma of the 'forbidden scan' no longer applies to such patients."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the role of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in identifying pediatric trauma patients who required lifesaving interventions (LSIs). Prospective cohort study of children age 0 to 18 years who activated the trauma team response between August 15, 2017, and February 12, 2019, at a large, urban pediatric emergency department (ED).The relationship between the lowest somatic NIRS saturation and the need for LSIs (based on published consensus definition) was investigated. Categorical variables were analyzed by χ 2 test, and continuous variables were analyzed by Student t test. A total of 148 pediatric trauma patients had somatic NIRS monitoring and met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 65.5% were male with a mean ± SD age of 10.9 ± 6.0 years. Injuries included 67.6% blunt trauma and 28.4% penetrating trauma with mortality of 3.4% (n = 5). Overall, the median lowest somatic NIRS value was 72% (interquartile range, 58%-88%; range, 15%-95%), and 43.9% of patients had a somatic NIRS value <70%. The median somatic NIRS duration recorded was 11 minutes (interquartile range, 7-17 minutes; range, 1-105 minutes). Overall, 36.5% of patients required a LSI including 53 who required a lifesaving procedure, 17 required blood products, and 17 required vasopressors. Among procedures, requiring a thoracostomy was significant.Pediatric trauma patients with a somatic NIRS value <70% had a significantly increased odds of requiring a LSI (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-4.20). Somatic NIRS values <70% had a sensitivity and specificity of 56% and 63%, respectively. Pediatric trauma patients with somatic NIRS values <70% within 30 minutes of ED arrival have an increased odds of requiring LSIs. Among LSIs, pediatric trauma patients requiring thoracostomy was significant. The role of NIRS in incrementally improving the identification of critically injured children in the ED and prehospital setting should be evaluated in larger prospective multicenter studies."

    "abstract": "Perforated peptic ulcer is a common surgical emergency condition worldwide, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if early diagnosis and immediate surgical management were not carried out. Perforation occurs in roughly 5% of PUD patients during their lifetime; this study aimed to explore the wide range of clinical presentations, associated risk factors, complications, and surgical management of perforated peptic ulcer patients. A 5-year retrospective observational study on the clinical presentation and surgical management of perforated peptic ulcer is carried out in a tertiary hospital in Mogadishu, Somalia, Department of General Surgery, from January 2017 to December 2021. We included all patients undergoing operations with an intraoperative confirmed diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer at the general surgery department. For operated patients, follow-up evaluation was performed in the outpatient department. Fifty-one patients underwent an emergency operation for perforated peptic ulcer during the study period. The sociodemographic distribution of patients was 45 (88.2%) males and 6 (11.8%) females, giving a male-to-female ratio of 7.5:1. The mean age of patients was 35.5 ± 16.8 years, and the peak frequency was in the third decade. The commonest presenting symptoms were sudden onset of severe epigastric pain in 42 (82.4%) patients. Patients who presented perforated peptic ulcer within 24 h of initiation of symptoms were free from complications. Age-group and delayed presentation > 48 h after onset of symptoms were linked to postoperative complications and were statistically significant (P 0.032 and P 0.005), respectively. Four patients died (mortality rate of 7.8%). Two patients were reoperated because of the failed primary repair, and 4 patients had > 5 cm intra-abdominal abscess image-guided percutaneous drainage, and the rest were given antibiotic therapy according to peritoneal fluid culture and sensitivity results. The most common microorganism isolated was E. coli 22% and Klebsiella 11%. Other rare microorganisms (pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp.) were identified. In half (51%) of the patients with peritoneal fluid culture, no microorganism growth was seen. The distribution of perforated peptic ulcer is common in the young age-group in the third decades of life. Delayed presentation of the disease is linked because most patients arrived from remote areas where proper facilities of health care and health education are not available and the patient might come to the hospital in an advanced stage of the disease. We suggest conducting further researches, health awareness related to complications over-the-counter drugs self-medication, and bad habit including smoking, and to improve health-seeking behaviors of society."

    "abstract": "Papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is a rare complication of myocardial infarction. Its incidence has been decreasing nowadays because of improved early revascularization techniques. When it occurs, surgical treatment is the only therapeutic lifesaving approach. We report a case of an 85-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency room with chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed inferior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was revascularized emergently with a drug-eluting stent to the obtuse marginal artery. An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted for hemodynamic support. Six hours later, the patient developed shortness of breath with persistent hypotension. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large pericardial effusion with a pseudoaneurysm in the infero-septal apex. Immediate drainage of pericardial fluid was performed. Seventy-two hours later, the patient had flash pulmonary edema. A new severe eccentric mitral regurgitation was discovered on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Findings revealed a partial posteromedial papillary muscle tear and prolapse of the A2 scallop. The patient was not a candidate for surgical replacement or percutaneous repair due to the high surgical risk and poor functional status, and she passed away on day fifteen of her hospital stay. Limited case series have shown promising benefits of percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair in selected high surgical risk patients and as a bridge to definitive mitral valve replacement. A diagnosis of PMR should be in the differential diagnosis, especially when evaluating hemodynamically unstable patients who present with prolonged symptoms."

The neck on external examination showed only a ligature mark without open wounds. The injury was identified while attempting tracheostomy as the patient had a decreased oxygen saturation and was aphonic. The patient underwent complete airway reconstruction and stenting as well as low tracheostomy with complete reconstruction and anastomosis of the esophagus. The patient was decannulated after a few weeks with the vocal cords in paramedian position and no aspiration.

    "abstract": "In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lengthy treatment and long-term steroid use are the main risk factors for developing aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections. In patients with cardiac tamponade, hemodynamic collapse may lead to acute renal and hepatic failure. We report the successful treatment of a 55-year-old woman with SLE since the age of 21. She suddenly felt chest pain approximately 2 weeks before developing fever and vomiting and was admitted to our hospital. Initially, she had severe liver dysfunction and was admitted to the hepatology department, where treatment for fulminant hepatitis was initiated. However, computed tomography (CT) showed an acute aortic dissection (DeBakey type II) and severe bloody pericardial effusion. Therefore, we performed emergency pericardial drainage. Plasma exchange therapy was initiated as emergency aortic surgery was deemed impossible due to impaired liver function tests and coagulation. Ten days later, the patient developed peritonitis due to small bowel perforation, and laparotomy was performed for abscess drainage and perforation closure. She had received steroid pulse therapy at the age of 21. At 40 years of age, she developed deep vein thrombosis due to antiphospholipid antibodies and was prescribed prednisolone. She was ambulatory at 3 months after the onset of acute aortic dissection, and CT revealed a rapidly enlarging true aneurysm in the distal arch. We performed elective aortic surgery. Although there were no antiphospholipid antibodies, surgery could have led to a devastating antiphospholipid syndrome. Therefore, we decided to treat the patient with triple therapy. Methylprednisolone was intravenously administered intraoperatively and at 1 day postoperatively. The patient was discharged without complications after returning to her usual oral prednisolone regimen. The patient described herein had a systemic circulatory failure due to cardiac tamponade, accompanied by liver failure. This condition is a significant cause of death in patients with aortic dissection-associated SLE and is extremely dangerous. However, multi-specialty intervention helped the patient recover, and she has been attending the outpatient clinic. Aortic surgery requiring hypothermia in SLE patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and a history of thrombocytopenia or thrombosis requires a multi-disciplinary treatment team, including cardiac surgeons and medical experts."

Concerns persist that complications, particularly gluteal necrosis, following TBIIAL should preclude its use, despite a lack of formal research on TBIIAL complications. This study aimed to define complications following TBIIAL for emergent control of traumatic pelvic bleeding.Study Design: Patients undergoing TBIIAL after blunt trauma (2008-2020) at our level 1 trauma center were included without exclusions. Demographics, clinical/injury data, and outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistics summarized study variables. Multivariable analysis of factors independently associated with mortality after TBIIAL was performed.Results: In total, 77 patients undergoing emergent TBIIAL after blunt trauma were identified. Median age was 46 [IQR 29-63] years. Most patients (n = 70, 91%) were severely injured (ISS ≥16), with 43% undergoing resuscitative thoracotomy prior to TBIIAL. No local complications (gluteal necrosis, iatrogenic injury, fascial dehiscence, surgical site infection) after TBIIAL occurred over the 13-year study period. In the first 28 days after injury, median hospital-, ICU-, and ventilator-free days were 0. Mortality was 70% (n = 54). On multivariable analysis, older age was the only variable independently associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 1.081, P = .028).Conclusion: Zero cases of gluteal necrosis, iatrogenic injury to surrounding structures, or surgical site infection/fascial dehiscence of the exploratory laparotomy occurred over the study period. High concern for gluteal necrosis after TBIIAL in severely injured trauma patients is unfounded and should not prevent a surgeon from obtaining prompt pelvic hemorrhage control with this technique among patients in extremis."

    "abstract": "Jejunogastric intussusception (JGI) is a rare, but potentially fatal complication that can occur following gastric surgery, and the reported incidence of JGI is as low as 0.1%. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for JGI to prevent major complications such as bowel necrosis and death. Although emergency surgery is the standard treatment, endoscopic reduction has also been reported to be effective in JGI patients without bowel necrosis. Several early recurrent cases treated with surgical or endoscopic reduction have been reported. We report an extremely rare case of JGI after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) using Child's procedure that was successfully treated with surgical reduction and fixation. An 81-year-old man who had undergone PD using Child's procedure 3 years ago presented to our hospital with epigastric pain and nausea. His vital signs were stable, and abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness with a palpable mass in the mid-epigastrium. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and gastroscopy revealed a JGI of the efferent loop, and exploratory laparotomy was immediately performed. During the operation, the efferent loop showed no adhesions and was intussuscepted through the gastrojejunostomy into the gastric lumen. An incision in the anterior wall of the stomach revealed no evidence of ischemia of the intussusceptum. The efferent loop was reduced using Hutchinson's maneuver and fixed to the afferent loop to prevent a recurrence. The postoperative course was uneventful, and there was no sign of recurrence 12 months postoperatively. JGI after PD is an extremely rare, but has severe complications. Surgery might be the optimal treatment for JGI in terms of preventing recurrence, even in cases without bowel necrosis."

As per the guidelines, pericardiocentesis can be done as a bridge to thoracotomy. However, no clear guidelines exist on the management of cardiac tamponade due to blunt cardiac injury. In the following case report, we propose a management plan for blunt cardiac injury in the emergency department. In the following case report, we describe a patient with a road traffic accident who had a blunt cardiac injury and had cardiac tamponade for whom we did not do emergency pericardiocentesis. Instead, we managed the patient with iv fluids and blood transfusion and the patient was taken up for immediate emergency thoracotomy. Not all cardiac tamponade requires pericardiocentesis. Cardiac tamponade due to injury to the low-pressure system can be best managed by initial resuscitation followed by emergency thoracotomy. We also propose a management plan for managing a patient with cardiac tamponade due to blunt cardiac injury when the injury can be visible in the low-pressure chambers."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a rare but serious manifestation of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome Type 2 (APS 2). Patients often present with symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and adrenal insufficiency, but the insidious onset of the disease may lead to delayed diagnosis, which can progress rapidly to haemodynamic instability requiring urgent intervention. A 39-year-old previously healthy male was admitted with cardiac tamponade complicated by cardiac arrest requiring emergent pericardiocentesis. An extensive work up revealed primary adrenal insufficiency and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. His positive autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and 21-hydroxylase combined with rapid improvement with initiation of corticosteroids and levothyroxine confirmed a diagnosis of APS 2. Although this disease is often difficult to diagnose given its vague symptoms, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis for young patients presenting with pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade of unknown origin. Early diagnosis and management are critical and often result in rapid improvement after appropriate treatment."

We report the case of a 59-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency department with a rapidly expanding chest wall hematoma. Six weeks earlier, he had sustained multiple rib fractures and a pneumothorax after falling 4 m from a ladder. Computed tomography angiography was used to identify two sources of active bleeding on the left dorsal scapular artery. The patient underwent surgery with evacuation of the hematoma and ligation of the artery. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days and recovered with no sequelae. A literature review revealed eight previously reported cases of chest wall hematomas exterior to the endothoracic fascia following blunt trauma. Most cases were initially diagnosed by computed tomography of the chest and finally by angiogram. Management options range from surgical drainage to angiographic embolization. This case is unusual regarding the delay in the development of the hematoma and illustrates the importance of considering this diagnosis even weeks after relevant trauma."

To determine the utility of postoperative CT performed within 48 h of emergency surgery after penetrating trauma. Trauma registry data were retrieved over a seven-year period at a single level 1 trauma center. All patients aged ≥17 years, admitted with penetrating injury, who underwent urgent surgery and postoperative CT imaging within 48 h, were included. Pre- and intraoperative medical records were compared to CT findings. Age, sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), New Injury Severity Score (NISS), 30-day mortality, injury mechanism, surgical intervention, and intensive care unit length of stay were extracted. Out of 1262 patients, 38 fulfilled the study criteria (36 men [94.7%], 2 women [5.3%]; mean age = 31.5 years. Stab wound (SW) was the most common injury mechanism (26/38, 68.4%) followed by gunshot wound (GSW; 10/38, 26.3%). Patients with GSWs were more severely injured than SW victims (median NISS = 34 [range = 3-75]; for GSWs = 34; for SWs = 26; P = 0.045). Out of 38 patients, 20 (52.6%) had additional findings at postoperative CT. Six patients (15.8%) had unidentified or underestimated findings at CT that were severe enough to warrant additional surgery or angiography. Postoperative CT imaging after emergency surgery in penetrating trauma is an important tool in evaluating the injury panorama. Out of 38 patients, 6 (15.8%) had findings at postoperative CT that warranted additional surgical or angiographic intervention."

Acute appendicitis is the most common nonobstetric surgical emergency during pregnancy, with an incidence of 1 per 500-2000 pregnancies. Delayed diagnosis and reluctance to operate on a pregnant woman predispose to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The elective termination of pregnancy or interventions to prolong it in the presence of appendicitis is controversial. We present a case of a 38-year-old Caucasian woman, G2P0, admitted to the Obstetric Emergency Department at 13 4/7 weeks of gestation with a primary complaint of severe nausea and vomiting associated with progressive diffuse abdominal pain which had started 7 days before. After the difficulty of inherent differential diagnosis, she was diagnosed with generalized peritonitis due to acute perforated appendicitis. Prompt exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy and drainage of multiple abscesses were performed. Conservative obstetrical management was assumed, with subsequent periodic monitoring of the fetal focus. Due to abdominal compartment syndrome, the abdomen was left open for 4 days. After 7 days in the intensive care unit, recovery was favorable, pregnancy remained uneventful, and a healthy full-term baby was born 27 weeks later. This case represents a successful example of how the cooperation of the obstetrics and general surgery teams and the decision of conservative obstetrical management in the surgical environment contributed to optimizing maternal health, achieving the best obstetrical outcome."

Computed tomography is a fast and easily accessible modality for detecting air in the vasculature. We report CT findings of a rare case with a thoracic gunshot wound, which demonstrate air almost in all systemic vessels like ''full body pneumoangiography''. A 42-year-old male patient with a thoracic gunshot wound was admitted to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) unit in a state of cardiac arrest. Postmortem Computed Tomography (CT) was performed and extensive air was revealed in several great vessels. We conclude that the underline causes of massive air embolism in our case are two main mechanisms: firstly, massive air enters the vasculature via bronchovascular fistula as there was bilateral lung contusion and directly through cardiac truncus, secondly while CPR was being conducted, massive air was pumped to the systemic circulation."

Sixteen participants (sex: women, 10, and men, 6; age: median, 34 years, and range, 18-67 years) were followed up at a median of 7.7 years (range, 4.7-12.8 years) after embolization. Splenic lacerations were of American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grades III to V, and 14 procedures involved proximal embolization. All individuals had measurable levels of IgM memory B cells (median, 14.30 as %B cells), splenic tissue present on ultrasound (median, 122 mL), and no history of severe infection since SAE. In conclusion, this study quantitatively demonstrated that long-term immune function remains after SAE for blunt abdominal trauma based on the IgM memory B cell levels."

    "abstract": "Splenic and hepatic pseudoaneurysm (PA) is a rare arteriovenous injury that may occur following abdominal trauma. The most frequent complication of PA is late rupture, which can lead to hemodynamic instability. The objective of this study was to describe our experience in the management of visceral PA. A retrospective study of patients under 15 years of age with blunt abdominal trauma associated with splenic and/or hepatic injury treated from 2012 to 2020 was carried out. PA formation and management were analyzed. All patients underwent CT-scan, which allowed trauma grade to be established, and also control contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in the first week following trauma. If PA was confirmed, angiography ± percutaneous embolization were performed. A total of 32 patients with blunt trauma were included. Mean age was 8.7 ± 3.2 years (2-15 years). 68.7% (n = 22) of patients were male. Median trauma grade was grade III (grades II-IV). 33.3% (n = 5/15) of patients developed splenic PA, and 5.8% (n = 1/17) of patients developed hepatic PA, with mean diagnostic time being 3.7 ± 3 (3-8) days. PA formation was associated with higher severity scores, with a mean difference of 15.6 ± 5.3 (95% CI: 4.37:26.14 p < 0.008). All PA cases - except for one, which required urgent splenectomy - were treated with embolization (85.7%) (n = 5/6). Visceral PA is underdiagnosed, with an incidence higher than reported. Imaging studies (CEUS) are required prior to discharge in the presence of severe trauma. Treatment remains controversial, but we recommend percutaneous embolization, with splenectomy being reserved for unstable patients. Los pseudoaneurismas (PA) esplénicos y hepáticos son lesiones arteriovenosas raras que se pueden desarrollar tras un traumatismo abdominal.

Estudio retrospectivo en pacientes menores de 15 años con traumatismo abdominal cerrado con lesión esplénica y/o hepática, entre 2012-2020. Se analizó el desarrollo de PA y el manejo realizado. En todos los pacientes se realizó tomografía computarizada estableciendo el grado del traumatismo, y estudio control en la primera semana postratumatismo mediante ecografía con contraste (CEUS). Si se confirmaba un PA se procedió a angiograma ± embolización percutánea.

El desarrollo de PA se asoció a mayor puntuación en el índice de severidad con una diferencia de medias de 15,6 ± 5,3 (CI 95% 4,37:26,14 p < 0,008). Todos los PA se trataron mediante embolización un 85,7% (n = 5/6) excepto una esplenectomía urgente. Los PA viscerales están infradiagnosticados, con una incidencia mayor a la reportada. Consideramos que un estudio de imagen (CEUS) debe ser realizado previo al alta en los traumatismos severos.

To determine findings and associated outcomes of exploratory laparotomies in donkeys. Descriptive retrospective study. Donkeys undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy for investigation and treatment of colic at seven UK referral hospitals between 2005-2017 were included. Data were retrieved from available hospital records. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistical analysis of outcomes of interest was performed in three steps. Thirty-three cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Clinical signs on presentation were available for 32 donkeys, of which 53.1% (17/32) presented for investigation of colic while in 46.9% (15/32) the presenting complaint was non-specific. Primary lesion location included small intestine (42.4%, 14/33), large colon (39.3%, 13/33), caecum (6.1%, 2/33), stomach (6.1%, 2/33) and 6.1% (2/33) had multiple abnormal findings without a clear primary lesion. Overall survival to discharge was 54.5% (18/33). Five donkeys (15.2%, 5/33) were euthanased at surgery and of those recovering from general anaesthesia a further 35.7% (10/28) were euthanased or died prior to discharge. Six donkeys (21.4%, 6/28) required a second laparotomy of which 4 (66.7%, 4/6) survived. Post-operative complications occurred in 82.1% (23/28) of cases and included hyperlipaemia (42.9%, 12/28), incisional complications (21.4%, 6/28), ileus (21.4%, 6/28) and persistent colic (17.9%, 5/28). When adjusted for other complications, donkeys with primary gastric lesions were less likely to have presented with severe colic compared with those with primary small intestinal lesions (OR: 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.95, p = 0.05). Only age was positively associated with death prior to discharge (OR: 1.18, 95% CI 1.03-1.36, p = 0.02). Small sample size and retrospective design. Donkeys with abdominal lesions may present with a range of signs often not including colic. Surgical findings were diverse and survival to discharge appears to be lower than in horses. Notfall-Laparotomien bei Eseln zur Untersuchung und Behandlung von Koliken werden nur selten durchgeführt und es gibt nur begrenzt Literatur zu diesem Thema. Bestimmung der Befunde und der damit verbundenen Ergebnisse von explorativen Laparotomien bei Eseln. Deskriptive retrospektive Studie. Esel, bei denen zwischen 2005 und 2017 in sieben britischen Tierkliniken eine explorative Notfall-Laparotomie zur Untersuchung und Behandlung von Koliken durchgeführt wurde, wurden in die Studie eingeschlossen. Die Daten wurden aus den verfügbaren Patientenkarteien entnommen. Die deskriptive Statistik und die schlussfolgernde statistische Analyse wurde in drei Schritten durchgeführt. Die Einschlusskriterien erfüllten 33 Fälle. Daten zu den klinischen Symptomen waren von 32 Eseln verfügbar, von denen 53.1% (17/32) zur Untersuchung einer Kolik vorgestellt wurden, während bei 46.9% (15/32) die Beschwerden unspezifisch waren. Zu den primären Läsionen gehörten der Dünndarm (42.2%, 14/33), Dickdarm (39.3%, 13/33), Blinddarm (6.1%, 2/33), Magen (6.1%, 2/33) und 6.1% (2/33) wiesen mehrere abnormale Befunde ohne eindeutige primäre Läsion auf. Die Überlebensrate bis zur Entlassung betrug 54.5% (18/33). Fünf Esel (15.2%, 5/33) wurden intraoperativ euthanasiert. Weitere 35.7% (10/28) wurden vor der Entlassung euthanasiert oder starben. Sechs Esel (21.4%, 6/28) benötigten eine zweite Laparotomie, von diesen überlebten 4 (66.7%, 4/6). Postoperative Komplikationen traten in 82.1% (23/28) der Fälle auf und umfassten Hyperlipämie (42.9%, 12/28), Inzisionskomplikationen (21.4%, 6/28), Ileus (21.4%, 6/28) und anhaltende Koliken (17.9%, 5/28). Unter Berücksichtigung anderer Komplikationen war die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Esel mit primären Magenläsionen eine schwere Kolik hatten, geringer (p = 0.05) als bei Eseln mit primären Dünndarmläsionen (OR. 0.07, 95%CI 0.01-0.95). Nur das Alter stand in einem positiven Zusammenhang (p = 0.02) mit dem Tod vor der Entlassung. WICHTIGSTE EINSCHRÄNKUNGEN: Kleine Stichprobengröße und retrospektives Design. Esel mit abdominalen Läsionen können eine Reihe von Symptomen aufweisen, zu denen häufig keine Koliken gehören. Die chirurgischen Befunde waren vielfältig und die Überlebensrate bis zur Entlassung scheint geringer zu sein als bei Pferden."

    "abstract": "The professional society guidelines recommend that transvenous lead extraction (TLE) operating teams collaborate closely with cardiac surgeons in the management of life-threatening complications. We assessed the role of cardiac surgeons participating in 3462 TLE procedures at a high-volume center between 2006 and 2021. The roles for cardiac surgery in TLE can be categorized into five areas: emergency surgical interventions for the management of cardiac laceration and severe bleeding (1.184%), cardiac surgery complementing partially successful TLE or vegetation removal (0.693%), delayed surgical treatment of TLE-related tricuspid valve dysfunction (0.751%), epicardial pacemaker implantation through sternotomy during emergency, complementing or delayed surgical interventions (0.607%), and delayed epicardial lead implantation (0.491%). Isolated damage to the wall of the right atrium was the most common cause of cardiac tamponade (53.66% of emergency surgeries) followed by injury to the right ventricle and vena cava (both 7.317%). Emergency cardiac surgery for the management of severe hemorrhagic complications is still the most common treatment option. The remaining areas include surgery complementing partially successful TLE: repair of tricuspid valve or epicardial ventricular lead placement to achieve permanent cardiac resynchronization. The experience at a single high-volume TLE center indicates the necessity of close collaboration with the cardiac surgeons whose roles appear broader than the mere surgical standby. Mortality in patients who survived cardiac surgery during TLE does not differ from the survival of other patients after TLE without complications requiring surgical intervention."

He was initially treated with emergency surgery for right ventricular free wall rupture, with an uneventful postoperative course. During follow-up, the patient complained of exercise intolerance and dyspnea on effort. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a previously undiagnosed severe tricuspid regurgitation due to flail of the anterior leaflet and a ruptured chorda. A redo operation was scheduled, and the valve was successfully repaired, with different techniques employed. This case highlights the importance of careful clinical evaluation of victims of chest penetrating trauma and how early diagnosis of hidden valvular lesions might increase the odds of valve repair.

Here, we report a case of a patient with a synovial sarcoma that occurred in the mediastinum. The initial pathological diagnosis was suspected angiofibroma after surgical resection. After surgery, the tumor recurred in the pericardium and caused cardiac tamponade. Pericardial fenestration was performed and the patient was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma. The final diagnosis was the postoperative pericardial recurrence of the mediastinal synovial sarcoma. It is important to consider follow-up on the basis of the malignant tumor, especially if the disease is rare."

    "title": "Test Characteristics of Chest Ultrasonography for Rib Fractures Following Blunt Chest Trauma: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Chest ultrasonography has been reported as an accurate imaging modality and potentially superior to chest radiographs in diagnosing traumatic rib fractures. However, few studies have compared ultrasonography to the reference standard of computed tomography (CT), with no systematic reviews published on the topic to date. Our objective was to summarize the evidence comparing the test characteristics of chest ultrasonography to CT in diagnosing rib fractures. This study was performed and reported in adherence to PRISMA guidelines. We searched 5 databases plus gray literature from inception to October 2021. Two independent reviewers completed study selection, data extraction, and a QUADAS-2 risk of bias assessment. Summary measures were obtained from the Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic model. From 1,660 citations, we identified 7 studies for inclusion, of which 6 had available 2×2 data for meta-analysis (n = 663). Of the 6 studies, 3 involved emergency department-performed ultrasonography and 3 radiology-performed ultrasonography. Chest ultrasonography had a pooled sensitivity of 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.1 to 94.3) and specificity of 98.4% (95% CI, 90.2 to 99.8) compared with CT imaging for the diagnosis of any rib fracture. The finding of a fracture on ultrasonography, defined as an underlying cortical irregularity, was associated with a +likelihood ratio (LR) of 55.7 (95% CI, 8.5 to 363.4) for CT diagnosed rib fracture, while the absence of ultrasonography fracture held a -LR of 0.11 (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.20). We were unable to detect a difference in test characteristics between emergency department- and radiology-performed ultrasonography (P=.11). The overall risk of bias of included studies was high, with patient selection identified as the highest risk domain. Chest ultrasonography is both sensitive and highly specific in diagnosing rib fractures following blunt trauma."

    "abstract": "Penetrating subclavian-axillary artery injury is a rare vascular injury associated with high morbidity and mortality rates traditionally treated with open surgical repair, however endovascular treatments have been utilized in selected cases. We report a case of a 31-year-old male with a traumatic gunshot injury to the thoracoacromial branch of the left axillary artery successfully managed with endovascular embolization at a regional trauma center. The availability of a hybrid operating suite in severely injured patients is associated with reduced time to intervention, reduced operative duration and improved clinical outcomes. Our experience demonstrates the utility and benefit of a hybrid operating theatre in a regional trauma center. The availability of a hybrid suite allowed rapid diagnostic and therapeutic angiography with a minimally invasive approach and eliminated the need for urgent open surgical management. However, the high costs associated with a hybrid operating theatre remain the major barrier for most regional centers. The availability of hybrid operating theatre at a regional trauma center allowed early diagnosis and successful management of the injury with a minimally invasive endovascular approach."

    "abstract": "In penetrating injuries, neurovascular structures are the main concern as they can be damaged either at the point of injury or are at risk of iatrogenic damage during exploration. Lapse in planning and a hasty attempt at retrieval in the emergency, often results in retention of a part of the foreign body. In this case report, we emphasize the need for exploration in the operating room to prevent potential complications from missed foreign body. A 24-year-old motorcyclist involved in a road traffic collision was received at our trauma center, with a foreign object sticking out from his lower third right arm. On clinical exam, there were no distal neurovascular deficits. A radiograph was taken and the patient was shifted to the theater. On exploration, the foreign body was removed with gentle manipulation after careful debridement, along its path of insertion. Only localized muscle injury was noted. All the surrounding neurovascular structures were intact. At 3 weeks, wound had healed with no residual symptoms. Penetrating trauma is notorious for neurovascular injuries and therefore a meticulous history taking, clinical exam, and planning is vital. Exploration in the operating room is a must for complete and safe retrieval of the foreign body."

There is no evidence from controlled trials to show the effect of these programmes on patient outcomes. We describe the protocol of a pilot study that aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing advanced trauma life support (ATLS) and primary trauma care (PTC) with standard care. We will pilot a pragmatic three-armed parallel, cluster randomised controlled trial in India, where neither of these programmes are routinely taught. We will recruit tertiary hospitals and include trauma patients and residents managing these patients. Two hospitals will be randomised to ATLS, two to PTC and two to standard care. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at 30 days from the time of arrival to the emergency department. Our secondary outcomes will include patient, provider and process measures. All outcomes except time-to-event outcomes will be measured both as final values as well as change from baseline. We will compare outcomes in three combinations of trial arms: ATLS versus PTC, ATLS versus standard care and PTC versus standard care using absolute and relative differences along with associated CIs. We will conduct subgroup analyses across the clinical subgroups men, women, blunt multisystem trauma, penetrating trauma, shock, severe traumatic brain injury and elderly. In parallel to the pilot study, we will conduct community consultations to inform the planning of the full-scale trial. We will apply for ethics approvals to the local institutional review board in each hospital. The protocol will be published to Clinical Trials Registry-India and ClinicalTrials.gov. The results will be published and the anonymised data and code for analysis will be released publicly."

    "abstract": "Congenital intestinal malrotation (CIM) is a common malformation in neonates. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention can improve the prognosis. CIM combined with congenital gastric wall defect is a potentially fatal condition. We present a severe case of CIM with gastric wall defect causing extensive gut necrosis and short gut syndrome. After three operations, the neonate survived and subsequently showed normal growth and development during infancy. A male neonate (age: 4 d) was hospitalized due to bloody stools and vomiting for 2 d, and abdominal distention for 1 d. Emergent exploratory laparotomy revealed black purplish discoloration of the bowel loops. Bowel alignment was abnormal with congestion and dilatation of the entire intestine, and clockwise mesentery volvulus (720°). The posterior wall of the gastric body near the greater curvature showed a defect in the muscularis layer (approximately 5.5 cm), and a circular perforation (approximately 3 cm diameter) at the center of this defect. Ladd's procedure was performed and gastric wall defect was repaired. Third operation performed 53 d after birth revealed extensive adherence of small intestine and peritoneum, and adhesion angulated between many small intestinal loops. We performed intestinal adhesiolysis, resection of necrotic intestine, and small bowel anastomosis. This case highlights that prolonged medical treatment may help improve intestinal salvage after surgical removal of necrotic intestines, and improve patient prognosis."

    "title": "Large Solitary Pyogenic Liver Abscesses: A Review of Their Management at a Tertiary Care Hospital.",
    "abstract": "Background and objective Liver abscesses are one of the common surgical diseases to be treated as an emergency in any tertiary care hospital in India. The formation of abscesses in the liver is still a major problem and associated with significant morbidity in developing countries. We come across all types of liver abscesses, such as amoebic (most common), pyogenic, mixed, and occasionally fungal. There have been several studies on the percutaneous modality of treatment for pyogenic liver abscesses. Most of the studies suggest that percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) offers a better approach than aspirations for treating pyogenic liver abscesses. However, a few recent studies suggest that percutaneous aspiration leads to equally good results when compared to percutaneous drainage. In this study, we aimed to review the management of solitary large pyogenic liver abscesses and to assess the effectiveness of ultrasonography (USG)-guided aspiration in the procedure.  Methods A retrospective study was carried out at the Department of General Surgery of our institute. In this study, a total of 27 patients treated for solitary pyogenic liver abscess were included. All patients with a large liver abscess greater than 5 cm without the features of frank peritonitis were included. These patients were followed up regularly for six months. Results The single-attempt USG-guided aspiration was successful in 70.3% of patients. Repeat USG-guided aspiration was performed in 18.5% of patients. In 7.4% of patients, a USG-guided percutaneous pigtail catheter was placed. And only 3.7% of cases required exploratory laparotomy.  Conclusion Based on our findings, USG-guided aspiration is a fairly efficient method for treating a large solitary pyogenic abscess with acceptable results, shorter hospital stays, and minimal complications."

    "abstract": "Even if the vascular repair is successful, the frequency of limb loss is still high when popliteal artery injury is associated with postischemic syndrome due to blunt trauma or a prolonged ischemic time. Because prolonged ischemia interferes with an injured foot rescue, shortening of the ischemic time is a major aim of surgeons. We present two types of transient external arterial bypass and two cases of ischemic extremities due to main arterial injury. Even though the injured extremities had no circulation for more than 6 h, a transient external arterial bypass supplied circulation immediately, and they were reconstructed successfully. Although transient external arterial bypass is a dated technique, it is a recommended option, especially in the management of acute traumatic ischemia of the extremities to shorten the ischemic time and provide immediate reperfusion, which will bring the opportunity to save the ischemic limbs."

Existing REBOA literature focuses on blunt trauma without a clearly defined role in penetrating trauma. This study compared clinical/injury data and outcomes after REBOA in penetrating vs blunt trauma. All patients in the Aortic Occlusion for Resuscitation in Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (AORTA) database, an observational American Association for the Surgery of Trauma dataset of trauma patients requiring aortic occlusion, who underwent REBOA were included (January 2014 through February 2021). Study groups were defined by mechanism: penetrating vs blunt. Subgroup analysis was performed of patients arriving with vital signs. Univariable/multivariable analyses compared injuries and outcomes. Seven hundred fifty-nine patients underwent REBOA: 152 (20%) penetrating and 607 (80%) blunt. Patients undergoing penetrating REBOA were less severely injured (injury severity score 25 vs 34; p < 0.001). The most common hemorrhage source was abdominal in penetrating REBOA (79%) and pelvic in blunt REBOA (31%; p = 0.002). Penetrating REBOA was more likely to occur in the operating room (36% vs 17%) and less likely in the emergency department (63% vs 81%; p < 0.001). Penetrating REBOA used more zone I balloon deployment (76% vs 64%) and less zone III (19% vs 34%; p = 0.001). Improved or stabilized hemodynamics were less frequent after penetrating REBOA (41% vs 62%, p < 0.001; 23% vs 41%, p < 0.001). On subgroup analysis of patients arriving alive, improvement or stabilization in hemodynamics was similar between groups (87% vs 86%, p = 0.388; 77% vs 72%, p = 0.273). Penetrating REBOA was not independently associated with mortality (odds ratio 1.253; p = 0.776). Despite lower injury severity, REBOA was significantly less likely to improve or stabilize hemodynamics after penetrating trauma. Among patients arriving alive, however, outcomes were comparable, suggesting that penetrating REBOA may be most beneficial among patients with vital signs. Because hemorrhage source, catheter insertion setting, and deployment zone varied significantly between groups, existing blunt REBOA data may not be appropriately extrapolated to penetrating trauma. Further study of REBOA as a means of aortic occlusion in penetrating trauma is needed."

    "abstract": "Background Brachial artery lacerations are limb-threatening injuries requiring emergent repair. Concomitant peripheral nerve symptoms are often only identified postoperatively. This study evaluated the prevalence of peripheral nerve deficits among this population as the indications for early nerve exploration have not been definitively established. Methods We reviewed all patients sustaining a brachial artery injury at one pediatric and two adult Level I Trauma Centers between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2017. We recorded patient demographics, comorbidities, intoxication status, injury mechanism, concomitant injuries, type of repair, and intraoperative peripheral nerve exploration findings. Pre-and post-operative and long-term peripheral nerve function examination findings were analyzed. Differences between categorical variables were determined with Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results Thirty-four patients sustained traumatic brachial artery lacerations requiring operative repair. Injury mechanisms included tidy (clean cut) laceration (n=11, 32%), gunshot wound (n=9, 26%), blunt trauma (n=8, 24%), and untidy laceration (n=6, 18%). Preoperatively, 15% had a normal peripheral nerve examination, 26% had localizable symptoms, 38% had non-localizable symptoms, and 21% were taken to the operating room without formal nerve assessment. Thirty-two percent underwent formal nerve exploration, and 81% underwent nerve repair. At an average follow-up of 2.5 years, 27% of patients underwent exploration, and 39% did not have localizable peripheral nerve deficits (p=0.705). Conclusions Brachial artery injuries are associated with a clinically significant risk for long-term peripheral nerve symptoms. Early nerve exploration in patients with peripheral nerve symptoms after a brachial artery injury may be warranted, although there is no statistically significant likelihood for improved peripheral neurological outcomes."

At 2 years of age, patient accidentally ingested a caustic liquid alkali and underwent emergency tracheostomy, exploratory laparotomy, and tube gastrectomy. 11 years after, patient was seen at the outpatient department for decannulation. On nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, a supraglottic stenosis with a central 1-mm opening was visualized. Patient underwent transoral carbon dioxide laser excision of supraglottic stenosis.

Patient was discharged well with no immediate complications and was successfully decannulated 1 month post operation with good voice outcome. No recurrence of stenosis at one year post operation. Accidental caustic ingestion commonly occurs in the pediatric age group. A frequent complication of accidental caustic ingestion is strictures. The use of transoral carbon dioxide laser in the surgical treatment of supraglottic stenosis is a suitable option for pediatric patients as this offer several advantages such as less post operative edema, good intraoperative control of hemorrhage, few post-operative complications and is less invasive compared to open laryngeal procedures. This case exhibits the importance of close monitoring for pediatric patients after caustic ingestion in order to diagnose complications earlier."

The degree of malignancy is extremely high. The pathogenesis of ileal perforation caused by NHL remains unclear, as well as the chromosome and immune system abnormalities, which may be related to NHL, and are indistinguishable from other benign and malignant conditions and are clinically nonspecific. We describe an 84-year-old man with abdominal pain for 4 days, which was aggravated for 3 h. The pain was in the upper abdominal region and was initially considered to be due to gastrointestinal perforation. He had persistent insidious pain, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and fever. Physical examination indicated that the patient had pain all over the abdomen; also, rebound pain and muscle tension, and bowel sounds were reduced on auscultation. An abdominal CT scan showed free gas in the abdominal cavity. The patient was diagnosed with peritonitis due to hollow viscus perforation. A prompt exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings showed perforations in the ileum that are approximately 40 cm from the ileocecal region, which were 3-8 mm in size. A segmental distribution was observed, and the intestinal contents overflowed with purulent discharge around the perforation surface. Resection and ileostomy were performed, and the clinical histopathological examination confirmed T-cell lymphoma. The patient was advised to visit the Oncology Department for further chemotherapy. Timely emergency surgery is the key to the treatment of ileal perforation caused by T-cell lymphoma. Resection and ileostomy were performed as intervention measures, and subsequent histopathological examination manifested T-cell lymphoma."

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of hyaluronic acid gel in the reduction of post-operative bowel obstruction symptoms in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy due to small bowel perforation and presenting with peritonitis. Methods In this experimental study, 78 patients were evaluated. All had presented to the emergency department with peritonitis secondary to small bowel perforation. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and after thorough lavage, a loop stoma was formed on the right side of the abdomen with an injection of hyaluronic acid gel injected into the abdominal cavity before the closure of the abdomen. Postoperative obstructive symptoms at one, three, and six months were evaluated. All patients underwent stoma reversal at three months. Results Obstructive bowel symptoms were seen in 18 patients (23.07%) patients. The cumulative incidence of obstructive symptoms at three months was only 8.97% but after the second intervention without protective gel, it increased to 23.07% at six months. Conclusions Cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel was effective in the reduction of post-operative bowel obstructive symptoms due to adhesions in patients who had presented with peritonitis due to small bowel perforation and had undergone exploratory laparotomy with stoma formation."

Preoperative diagnosis is challenging as the typical presentations of appendicitis are not usually seen. The diagnosis of appendicular knotting is usually an intraoperative surprise. A 34-year-old male patient (BMI-20.86 kg/m2) presented to the surgical emergency unit with colicky central abdominal pain of 2-days duration, which later involved the whole abdomen. In association with this, he had a history of frequent vomiting of ingested matter which later became bilious. The abdominal examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding and rigidity. On midline exploratory laparotomy, the inflamed appendix which was adherent to the distal part of the ileum was observed. The appendix and the encircled segment of the distal ileum were both gangrenous, and the patient underwent resection of the bowel segment in addition to appendectomy. Whenever an appendix wraps around an intestine or its tip adheres with small bowel, cecum, or posterior peritoneum forming a ring-like structure, and a segment of a bowel herniates through an opening can cause a closed-loop obstruction with or without strangulation. The management for ileo-appendicular knotting associated with gangrenous bowel could be appendectomy and resection of the bowel segment. Postoperatively, the patient had developed diarrhea caused by ileocecal resection, which later subsided by medication. Ileo-appendicular knotting is a rare cause of small intestinal obstruction, and it's challenging to diagnose during the preoperative period. As surgeons dealing with acute abdomen in routine clinical practice, knowledge of this unusual case is helpful for clinical suspicion and evidence-based management."

He had similar symptoms one month ago and was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rupture with hemoperitoneum, therefore he underwent trans-arterial embolization (TAE). However, the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed less possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma. Contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed possible umbilical vein contrast agent extravasation.

    "abstract": "Point of care ultrasound is an important tool for diagnosis of musculoskeletal and vascular pathology in patients presenting to the emergency department. Superficial vascular and soft tissue structures are well-visualized at the bedside using modern ultrasound systems and have image characteristics that can be rapidly identified. This report describes the use of point of care ultrasound to distinguish between rapidly progressive soft tissue infection and vascular injury following penetrating trauma from a cat scratch. Ultrasound allowed the physician to rapidly make accurate decisions about the next necessary steps in the patient's care. Point of care ultrasound provides immediate diagnostic information to supplement indeterminate physical examination findings. In this case, it allowed the treating physician to make the diagnosis of arterial injury using ultrasound image characteristics. An integrative approach to ultrasonography of superficial musculoskeletal and vascular structures could enhance clinical decision making and improve care of patients with similar complaints."

    "title": "Impending perforation near ileocecal junction due to phytobezoar impaction and intraluminal polyp: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Bezoars and polyps are an uncommon cause of mechanical intestinal obstruction. There are four different kinds of bezoars: phytobezoars, made of vegetables and fibers; trichobezoars, resulting from the ingestion of hair and frequently an expression of psychiatric disorders; lactobezoars, which are formed of milk curd; and pharmacobezoars, caused by drugs and medications. Signs and symptoms classically vary from abdominal pain to constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. We present a rare case of impending perforation along with an intraluminal polyp near ileocecal junction due to phytobezoar impaction. Our patient was a 59-year-old Sindhi female with a known history of interstitial lung disease and hypertension who presented to the emergency department with complaints of abdominal pain and constipation for 1 week, vomiting for 5 days, and abdominal distension for 2 days. After a preoperative examination and her failure to respond to conservative therapy, she was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy. A hard intraluminal mass was suspected to be obstructing the small bowel at the site of impending perforation. This mass was a phytobezoar along with an intraluminal polyp. Resection of the affected segment was performed, followed by ileoileal anastomosis, and a drain was left. The patient was discharged 1 week later and was found to be well with no complaints at 3 weeks follow-up. Early diagnosis of bezoars is important for early intervention and prevention of complications. Our case is unique as phytobezoar with intraluminal polyp is a rare clinical finding. Moreover, the signs and symptoms with which the patient presented are nonspecific and can be seen with multiple surgical emergencies."

    "abstract": "Several advancements in hemorrhage control have been advocated for in the past decade, including balanced transfusions and earlier times to intervention. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of these advancements on outcomes of blunt trauma patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. This is a 5-year (2013-2017) analysis of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program. Adult (18 years or older) blunt trauma patients with early (≤4 hours) packed red blood cell (PRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions and an emergency (≤4 hours) laparotomy for hemorrhage control were identified. Time-trend analysis of 24-hour mortality, PRBC/FFP ratio, and time to laparotomy was performed over the study period. The association between mortality and PRBC/FFP ratio, patient demographics, injury characteristics, transfusion volumes, and American College of Surgeons verification level was examined by hierarchical regression analysis adjusting for interyear variability. A total of 9,773 blunt trauma patients with emergency laparotomy were identified. The mean ± SD age was 44 ± 18 years, 67.5% were male, and median Injury Severity Score was 34 (range, 24-43). The mean ± SD systolic blood pressure at presentation was 73 ± 28 mm Hg, and the median transfusion requirements were PRBC 9 (range, 5-17) and FFP 6 (range, 3-12). During the 5-year analysis, time to laparotomy decreased from 1.87 hours to 1.37 hours ( p < 0.001), PRBC/FFP ratio at 4 hours decreased from 1.93 to 1.71 ( p < 0.001), and 24-hour mortality decreased from 23.0% to 19.3% ( p = 0.014). On multivariate analysis, decreased PRBC/FFP ratio was independently associated with decreased 24-hour mortality (odds ratio, 0.88; p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.89; p < 0.001). Resuscitation is becoming more balanced and time to emergency laparotomy shorter in blunt trauma patients, with a significant improvement in mortality. Future efforts should be directed toward incorporating transfusion practices and timely surgical interventions as markers of trauma center quality. Therapeutic/care management, level III."

    "abstract": "Duodenal injuries are rare due to their preserved retroperitoneal location. They are mostly observed after deep penetration or high-impact blunt trauma. They are difficult to diagnose and treat. Our purpose was to report a case of duodenal injury after blunt trauma with the review of the literature. A 20-year male patient was brought to Emergency Department with abdominal pain after an accident, in which he was stuck between a reversing truck and a pole. Rigidity in all abdominal quadrants was detected. Free pelvic fluid was observed in computed tomography (CT). There was a grade II laceration at the fourth part of the duodenum. The laceration was primarily sutured, and a naso-jejunal tube was placed. The patient was discharged on postoperative day-8 with uneventful recovery. In suspicion of duodenal trauma, a meticulous anamnesis, careful physical examination, proper imaging technique at appropriate timing, and surgical exploration are important to reduce morbidity and mortality. Imaging findings of retroperitoneal organ injuries can be non-specific. We suggest that surgical exploration should be the first choice of treatment in cases with acute abdomen findings.

She had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTCD) one year prior for choledocholithiasis with acute cholangitis in her home country, Scotland. Unfortunately, while visiting family in the United States, her PTCD became dislodged, and she developed progressive worsening abdominal pain. Computerized tomography of her abdomen showed pneumobilia, perigastric inflammation, a contracted gallbladder, small bowl inflammation with a likely transition point at the mid-jejunum, and a probable duodenal mass. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy with intraoperative findings of choledochoduodenal fistula with coincident gastric and small bowel obstruction (SBO) secondary to three large, mixed gallstones. One 3 cm gallstone was located at the pylorus and two (2.3 and 3 cm) gallstones were isolated in the mid-jejunum, with one of those causing isolated transmural pressure necrosis with subsequent perforation. Bouveret syndrome is a rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) that manifests via an acquired cholecystoenteric fistula. Our patient presented with a concomitant GOO and SBO with perforation of the mid-jejunum. Timely diagnosis of Bouveret syndrome is essential, as most causes require emergent surgical intervention."

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) is an effective treatment for recurrent symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) despite medical therapy. Complications include cardiac tamponade, pulmonary vein stenosis, and rarely atrial-esophageal fistula (AEF). We present a case of a 77-year-old male patient with a history of persistent AF status post posterior left atrial isolation 50 days prior, who presented to the emergency department with bilateral lower extremity weakness ongoing for an hour. In addition, he reported a non-productive cough, chest discomfort, and dysphagia. He was hypertensive, febrile, tachycardic, and with tachypnea on initial assessment. Initial labs revealed leukocytosis with elevated troponin level. Brain imaging confirmed subacute infarcts suggestive of embolic disease. Tissue plasminogen activator was contraindicated. He was admitted for management of altered mental status and sepsis of an unknown origin. Due to associated chest discomfort and dysphagia, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest with contrast obtained revealed a small focus of air between the posterior wall of the left atrium and the esophagus. A few hours later, he deteriorated with worsened hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and he was taken to the operating room for open-heart surgery due to concern for AEF. Peri-operatively, a left atrial fistula measuring 0.5 cm was identified and closed. Also, a fibrinous material (3 × 4 cm) was identified and removed in the left inferior pulmonary vein. On post-operative day 1, he underwent an upper endoscopy, and a 1 cm esophageal defect was closed. Biopsy from fibrinous material was positive for polymicrobial organisms (lactobacillus, candida, and prevotella), while blood cultures grew Streptococcus anginosus. Despite treatment with aggressive intravenous antibiotics, the patient deteriorated with poor neurological function and ventilator dependency. A multidisciplinary team reached a consensus agreement for palliative measures. To our knowledge, this case represents one of the few cases documenting life-threatening infective endocarditis with septic emboli as a complication of AEF from RFA. Therefore, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion due to associated grave prognosis."

We report an alcoholic patient who initially presented to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory failure and acute-on-chronic pancreatitis with massive pancreatic pleural effusion. Subsequently, he developed insidiously pancreatitis-related intra-abdominal, mediastinal pseudocysts, and unexpectedly sudden onset of cardiac tamponade. Although tamponade-related haemodynamic instability improved soon after timely diagnosis and emergent pericardial drainage, his recovery period was prolonged. His serum amylase and lipase were persistently elevated until definitive treatment with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-assisted removal of pancreatic duct stones. Pancreatitis-related cardiac tamponade is rare but lethal without prompt diagnosis and management. We reviewed pancreatitis-related thoracic complications, particularly for cardiac tamponade, and discussed about the pathophysiology and management options."

He consulted us the day after the trauma with significant palpebral edema making the examination difficult. An emergency CT scan of the orbit and brain showed the presence of a right intraorbital foreign body. The patient underwent removal of the foreign body by an anterior orbitotomy with general antibiotic therapy and a simple postoperative course. Penetrating trauma to the orbit should raise the suspicion of the presence of a foreign body. A CT scan should be performed to specify its location. The extraction of the foreign body can be a challenge that requires an experienced surgical team."

Serial abdominal radiographs progressed to show distention of small bowel and air fluid levels. Operative intervention was undertaken with diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. On exploratory laparotomy, 24 cm of a fibrosed, ischemic closed-loop ileal segment densely adherent to the tip of a Meckel's diverticulum was identified and resected, followed by primary reanastamosis. Histologic findings confirmed ectopic gastric tissue. Symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum is often secondary to intestinal obstruction and hematochezia, findings which are caused by incarcerated inguinal hernia or ileocolic intussusception.

Patients who sustained severe multiple injuries accompanied by TAD following a car accident (n = 6) and falls from a height (n = 3) were treated in the emergency department of our hospital from October 2017 to July 2021. Data of these patients, including seven men and two women (average age, 53 ± 15.2 years; range, 18-83 years) were analysed retrospectively. Upon hospital arrival, the multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) trauma team, composed of doctors and nurses, immediately performed resuscitation following the Green Channel Consultation and Treatment Process for Severe Multiple Injuries. Life-threatening injuries were managed urgently. Blood tests and blood preparation and bedside B-scan ultrasonography and CT were performed. Aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted decisively in patients suspected of TAD so that endovascular graft exclusion (EVGE) with the aortic covered stent can be performed promptly, followed by emergency management, second-stage surgery, and intensive care according to the injury control strategy. This study included nine patients suffering from severe multiple injuries accompanied by Stanford type B TAD, with injury severity scores ranging from 35 to 43 points. Six patients underwent EVGE while receiving emergency treatment, whereas two patients who also had intracranial haemorrhage underwent selective EVGE. One case of TAD missed in the emergency department was detected 13 days after hospitalisation; therefore, the patient promptly underwent EVGE. Emergency procedures performed included exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy (n = 2), thoracic closed drainage (n = 5), haemothoracotomy (n = 3), second-stage fracture surgery (n = 4), and tracheotomy (n = 1). Postinjury complications included haemorrhagic shock, coagulation disorders, hyoxaemia, pulmonary infection, renal insufficiency, and hypoproteinaemia; however, all patients recovered after intensive care treatment. Aortic CTA after EVGE revealed the disappearance of the dissection and the resorption of the intermural haematoma. However, varying degrees of stenosis or occlusion were observed in the left subclavian artery. Nine patients with severe multiple injuries were treated satisfactorily by the MDT, without fatalities, and all patients were discharged for rehabilitation. In this study, procedures including resuscitation, urgent aortic CTA for definitive diagnosis, prompt EVGE, emergency injury control surgery, second-stage definitive surgery, intensive care treatment, and rehabilitation were rationally performed by the emergency MDT trauma team. Overall, this continuous and seamless process is a key factor for the successful treatment of patients with severe multiple injuries accompanied by TAD."

Several cases of DKA without marked hyperglycemia have been reported and are defined as euglycemic DKA (eu-DKA). The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) is associated with the occurrence of eu-DKA, of which, dapagliflozin is one of the agents. In this study, we report a case of dapagliflozin-associated eu-DKA following surgery for pancreatic carcinoma. A 57-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain after surgery for pancreatic carcinoma. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed because of suspicion of gastrointestinal perforation based on a CT scan. The surgeons observed that the stomach was significantly dilated but not perforated. Meanwhile, the patient developed shock and severe acidosis. A further examination confirmed the diagnosis of dapagliflozin-associated eu-DKA. We reviewed the precipitating factors and mechanisms of SGLT2i-associated eu-DKA and discussed the treatment and prevention of this condition. Clinicians need to be alert of the occurrence of SGLT2i-associated eu-DKA in patients treated with this drug in the perioperative period."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a cardiovascular emergency caused by occlusion of one or more pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate from a deep venous thrombosis (subsequently called an embolus), typically in the large veins of the lower limb or pelvis. It is a common cause of preventable hospital death and a cause of mortality in obstetrics setting because it largely remains under diagnosed especially in a resource poor setting. Mrs OG, a 30-year-old primigravida, had a spontaneous delivery of a baby boy. A few hours after delivery, she had two episodes of syncope and was resuscitated with intra-venous fluids and blood transfusion. Further evaluation, with an abdominopelvic ultrasound scan, showed that she had supra-levator haematoma necessitating emergency exploratory laparotomy. During the induction of anaesthesia for the surgery, she had a cardiac arrest and was again resuscitated with cardiac compression and intravenous adrenaline. She was transferred to ICU on account of cardio-respiratory instability. On the 2nd day post operation, the chest physician reviewed and noted history of cough, haemoptysis and breathlessness of two days duration. She had an associated unilateral (right) leg swelling, with presence of cyanosis, tachypnoea and tachycardia with SPO2 fluctuating between 82-92% (while on oxygen with nasal prongs). The clinical probability of PE using Well's scoring system was high (11.5). In the absence of computerized tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography and ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan, a Doppler ultrasound of both legs was done which showed dilation of the proximal one-third of the right femoral vein with meshwork of thrombi. She was subsequently commenced on Enoxaparin and intra-venous fluids and antibiotics. She also received supplementary oxygen. The Prothrombin time and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were monitored over the period. She slowly but progressively improved and was discharged home on oral warfarin. The index patient had cardiopulmonary arrest and expectedly, needed urgent intervention with embolectomy or thrombolytic therapy. In the absence of these, anticoagulation with vasopressor agents, supplementary oxygen and close monitoring was able to sustain the patient. Pulmonary embolism is a killer condition with 10% of the patients dying within one hour of onset. Most times, mortality occurs in patients who were never diagnosed. The best prospect for reducing mortality in patients with PE lies in improving diagnosis. L’embolie pulmonaire (EP) est une urgence cardiovasculaire causée par l’occlusion d’une ou plusieurs artères pulmonaires par des thrombus provenant d’une thrombose veineuse profonde (appelée par la suite embole), généralement dans les grosses veines du membre inférieur ou du bassin. Il s’agit d’une cause fréquente de décès hospitalier évitable et d’une cause de mortalité en obstétrique car elle reste largement sous-diagnostiquée, en particulier dans un contexte de ressources limitées. Mme OG, une primigeste de 30 ans, a accouché spontanément d’un petit garçon. Quelques heures après l’accouchement, elle a eu deux épisodes de syncope et a été réanimée avec des fluides intraveineux et une transfusion sanguine. Une évaluation plus poussée, avec une échographie abdomino-pelvienne, a montré qu’elle avait un hématome supra-levatorien nécessitant une laparotomie exploratoire d’urgence. Pendant l’induction de l’anesthésie pour la chirurgie, elle a fait un arrêt cardiaque et a été réanimée par compression cardiaque et adrénaline intraveineuse. Elle a été transférée aux soins intensifs en raison de son instabilité cardio-respiratoire. Le deuxième jour après l’opération, le médecin thoracique a examiné et noté une histoire de toux, d’hémoptysie et d’essoufflement depuis deux jours. Elle présentait un gonflement unilatéral (droit) de la jambe, une cyanose, une tachypnée et une tachycardie avec une SPO2 fluctuant entre 82 et 92 % (sous oxygène avec des pinces nasales). La probabilité clinique d’EP en utilisant le système de notation de Well était élevée (11,5). En l’absence d’angiographie pulmonaire par tomodensitométrie et de scintigraphie de ventilation et de perfusion (V/Q), une échographie Doppler des deux jambes a été réalisée et a montré une dilatation du tiers proximal de la veine fémorale droite avec un maillage de thrombus. Elle a ensuite été mise sous Enoxaparine, fluides intraveineux et antibiotiques. Elle a également reçu de l’oxygène supplémentaire. Le temps de prothrombine et le rapport international normalisé (INR) ont été surveillés pendant toute la période. Elle s’est lentement mais progressivement améliorée et a été renvoyée chez elle sous warfarine orale. Le patient de référence a fait un arrêt cardio-pulmonaire et, comme on pouvait s’y attendre, a dû subir une intervention urgente avec embolectomie ou thérapie thrombolytique. En l’absence d’une telle intervention, une anticoagulation avec des agents vasopresseurs, un supplément d’oxygène et une surveillance étroite ont permis de maintenir le patient en vie. L’embolie pulmonaire est une maladie mortelle, 10% des patients décèdent dans l’heure qui suit son apparition. La plupart du temps, la mortalité survient chez des patients qui n’ont jamais été diagnostiqués. La meilleure perspective pour réduire la mortalité chez les patients atteints d’EP réside dans l’amélioration du diagnostic. Embolie pulmonaire, milieu pauvre en ressources, diagnostic, prise en charge."

    "abstract": "Background: The aim of this analysis was to assess the factors that influence the severity of pancreatic trauma cases, also underlining the importance of early and accurate diagnosis and proper management of each case. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of patients that were presented to the Clinical Emergency Hospital of Bucharest, Romania, in several periods of time: 1985-1990 (50 patients); 1990-1999 (102 patients); 2000-2005 (56 patients); 2012-2019 (48 patients). Results: The mean age was around 40 years old, with predominance of male incidence in all the groups and traffic accidents (blunt trauma) as the main cause of injury. Most patients (almost 50% in each group) were operated on within the first 24 hours from hospital presentation. The general mortality rate varied: 42% (1985-1990), 23.5% (1990-1999), 12.7% (2000-2005) and 33% (2012-2015). Pancreatic mortality rate was 6% (1985-1990 and 1990-1999), 3.5% (2000-2005) and 8% (2012-2019). Conclusions: During the last 35 years, the preoperative diagnosis in patients with trauma of the pancreas remained a challenge and the treatment of the pancreatic trauma suffered a very interesting evolution- from the very frequent laparotomy to the nonoperative management and the damage control. These procedures produced a significant decreasing of the negative or nontherapeutic laparotomies. For the effectiveness of treatment, methods must be correlated with the lesion score."

    "abstract": "Gall stone ileus is one of the rare complications of patients with cholelithiasis and usually affects elderly females. The usual sites for the stone to get impacted are the distal ileum and ileocaecal valve. Computed tomography (CT) remains diagnostic and surgery is the treatment of choice. A 60-year-old diabetic female, who was diagnosed with gall stone-induced pancreatitis one month ago, presented to the surgical emergency department with complaints of right upper abdominal pain with recurrent vomiting and constipation of five days duration. The patient was managed conservatively. A provisional diagnosis of subacute intestinal obstruction was kept and a barium meal follow-through (BMFT) was requested. However, BMFT was inconclusive. After two weeks, she presented again to the emergency department with clinical features of subacute intestinal obstruction. The patient was planned for exploratory laparotomy in view of recurrent episodes of obstruction and the presence of peritonism. Intraoperatively, we encountered a cholecystogastric fistula with a gall stone of size approximately 6.5x4 cm impacted at approximately 60 cm from the ileocaecal junction and dilated proximal small bowel loops. The surgical procedure comprised enterolithotomy and cholecystectomy along with repair of cholecystogastric fistula done. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. Gall stone ileus is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction. Gall stone ileus presenting with a recent history of pancreatitis further makes the suspicion very unlikely."

    "abstract": "This case discusses a 10-year-old boy who presented in significant respiratory distress with cardiac tamponade with associated gross ascites and hepatomegaly, requiring urgent transfer for pericardiocentesis. On further investigation, he was found to have multiple pulmonary emboli and evidence of panserositis. An underlying rheumatological cause was suspected in the absence of any evidence of infection or malignancy, and blood tests were positive for anti-double stranded DNA, anticardiolipin and antiglycoprotein antibodies as well as HLA B51. In his medical history, he has previously had mouth ulcers, chronic anaemia of undetermined cause and erythema multiforme. These symptoms, along with clinical presentation, mean a diagnosis of Behcet's disease and associated antiphospholipid syndrome was felt to be most likely. Anticoagulation therapy was commenced for treatment of the emboli, and colchicine was started for management of Behcet's disease. The patient was discharged clinically well from the hospital and continues under specialist rheumatological and haematological follow-up."

    "abstract": "Police transport (PT) of penetrating trauma patients has the potential to improve survival rates. There are no well-established guidelines for PT of penetrating trauma patients. This study examines the association between survival rate to hospital discharge of adult penetrating trauma patients and mode of transport (PT versus ground ambulance [GA]). A retrospective, matched cohort study was conducted using the United States (US) National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB). All adult penetrating injury patients transported by police to trauma centers were identified and matched (one-to-four) to patients transported by GA for analysis. Descriptive analysis was carried out. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were tabulated and stratified by the transport mode. Out of the 733 patients with penetrating injuries, ground Emergency Medical Services (EMS) transported 513 patients and police transported 220 patients. Most patients were 16-64 years of age with a male (95.6%) and Black/African American race (79.0%) predominance. Firearm-related injuries (68.8%) were the most common mechanism of injury with the majority of injuries involving the body extremities (62.9%). Open wounds were the most common nature of injury (75.7%). The overall survival rate to hospital discharge was similar for patients transported by GA and by police (94.5% versus 92.7%; P = .343). In this study, patients with penetrating trauma transported by police had similar outcomes to those transported by GA. As such, PT in penetrating trauma appears to be effective. Detailed protocols should be developed to further improve resource utilization and outcomes."

Very few cases have been documented with respect to survival from such an injury. To highlight the optimal management of such cases, namely through timely and safe transport to a trauma centre, maintaining a high degree of clinical suspicion for tamponade, early diagnostic ultrasound use, pericardial decompression, haemorrhage control and situational control. A case report delineating the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to an individual with right atrial appendage rupture. Subsequent post-operative and convalescent course till hospital discharge.A young male patient involved in a high-speed motor vehicle accident was hypotensive at the scene with altered sensorium. Transport to a trauma centre was delayed due to entrapment and geographical location. An ultrasound done on arrival identified cardiac tamponade, which was successfully treated with an emergent left lateral thoracotomy, pericardial decompression, and haemorrhage control from a ruptured right atrial appendage, with definitive closure in the operating theatre. Whilst rare, haemodynamic compromise in the absence of obvious thoracic trauma following high-energy, rapid deceleration mechanisms should raise suspicion for right atrial appendage rupture with pericardial tamponade. Aggressive resuscitation, early diagnostic ultrasound use and urgent pericardial decompression are essential in maximising the likelihood of positive outcomes."

Pericardial fluid gradually increased and state of shock was seen due to cardiac tamponade. Drainage was performed through sheaths and hemodynamic condition was stabilized. It was judged that urgent surgical repair was necessary. When cardiopulmonary bypass was attached and right atrial incision was made under cardiac arrest, two sheaths were piercing from right atrial to pericardial transverse sinus on the dorsal side of ascending aorta. After removing the sheaths, the perforation was closed directly inside and outside right atrial wall. The postoperative course was generally good."

This study verified the predictive capacity of mREMS in-hospital mortality in patients of blunt and penetrating trauma with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the performance of this index compared with the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score, Injury Severity Score, New Injury Severity Score, and Trauma and Injury Severity Score. METHODS: This is a retrospective, correlational study that analyzed trauma patients 18 years or older, who attended at a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied in the analyses. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 987 patients, 359 (36.4%) with TBI (225 blunt and 134 penetrating trauma). Regarding mREMS, the area under the ROC curve for TBI patients for in-hospital mortality was 0.506 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.404-0.609) for penetrating injuries and 0.486 (95% CI, 0.402-0.571) for blunt injuries; the values in patients without TBI were 0.629 (95% CI, 0.554-0.703) and 0.618 (95% CI, 0.552-0.684), respectively. In relation to the other indices the mREMS presented the lowest area under the curve/ROC for penetrating and blunt TBI, and the Rapid Emergency Medicine Score for extracranial injuries. CONCLUSION: The mREMS showed no prognostic capacity for patients with TBI, and it presented the worst performance in relation to the Injury Severity Score, New Injury Severity Score, and Trauma and Injury Severity Score to discriminate cases of in-hospital mortality when considering trauma patients with and without TBI."

    "abstract": "Femur fractures are painful, and use of systemic opioids and other sedatives can be dangerous in pediatric patients. The fascia iliaca compartment nerve block and femoral nerve block are regional anesthesia techniques to provide analgesia by anesthetizing the femoral nerve. They are widely used in adult patients and are associated with good effect and reduced opioid use. Ultrasound (US) guidance of nerve blocks can increase their safety and efficacy. We sought to report on the use and safety of US-guided regional anesthesia of the femoral nerve performed by emergency physicians for femur fractures in 6 pediatric emergency departments. Records were queried at 6 pediatric EDs across North America to identify patients with femur fractures managed with US-guided regional anesthesia of the femoral nerve between January 1, 2016, and May 1, 2021. Data were abstracted regarding demographics, injury pattern, nerve block technique, and analgesic use before and after nerve block. Eighty-five cases were identified. Median age was 5 years (interquartile range, 2-9 years). Most patients were male and had sustained blunt trauma (59% low-mechanism falls). Ninety-four percent of injuries were managed operatively. Most patients (79%) received intravenous opioid analgesia before their nerve block. Ropivacaine was the most common local anesthetic used (69% of blocks). No procedural complications or adverse effects were identified. Ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia of the femoral nerve is widely performed and can be performed safely on pediatric patients by emergency physicians and trainees in the pediatric emergency department."

Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignancy that is predominantly seen in men with advanced age with aggressive course. Ninety percent of cases are adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is very difficult to detect as is usually asymptomatic with no early signs. At least 80% of tumors are unresectable by the time of diagnosis. Despite substantial improvement in the survival rates for other major cancer forms, pancreatic cancer survival rates have remained relatively unchanged since 1960s. Multidisciplinary therapy with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery performed at high volume centers remains the best chance for cure. We report a rare case of a small T1 pancreatic head carcinoma with underlying chronic pancreatitis presenting with cancerous pericardial effusion and tamponade. Despite the small size of the primary tumor, the extensive pattern of lymphatic occlusion can lead to mesenteric and mediastinal lymphatic spread to the pericardium. US guided emergent pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 750 cc of serosanguinous fluid. Cytopathological examination of the fluid revealed poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    "abstract": "Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing inflammatory disease of the medium and small arteries which has variable clinical manifestations, course, and organ involvement. Intestinal necrosis resulting from PAN is rare, and successful treatment of such cases is even more uncommon. Here, we report the first successful treatment of PAN with intestinal necrosis in a young Chinese child. A 5-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with a 5-day history of abdominal pain. The patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy, which showed skipping necrosis of the intestinal wall. Intestinal resection and anastomosis failed to improve his abdominal pain. The patient's blood pressure remained high (140/120 mmHg), despite captopril treatment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and D-dimer level were also elevated at (106.00 mm/h and 11.16 mg/L, respectively), as was the 24-hour urine protein (197.6 mg/24 h). Echocardiography revealed that the diameters of the left and right coronary arteries were increased (0.45 and 0.49 cm, respectively). Ultrasound showed polyarteritis in the anterior tibial, radial, iliac, and renal arteries. Histopathologic examination revealed elastic fiber rupture and partial mesenteric arteriolar stenosis with occlusion. After 2 months of treatment with systemic methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone, the patient's abdominal pain was relieved. Furthermore, the patient's ESR and D-dimer levels had reduced to 5 mm/h and 0.63 mg/L, respectively; his 24-hour urine protein was normal (60.0 mg/24 h); and his blood pressure had dropped to 101/46 mmHg. The left and right coronary arteries had reduced to 0.35 and 0.38 cm in diameter, respectively; however, no significant improvement was observed in the other vessels involved. Unfortunately, the child's parents did not continue to seek medical attention; therefore, his long-term outcome is unknown. In this case, the patient was operated on immediately after symptom onset. The postoperative infection was also quickly controlled, avoiding the occurrence of septic shock. Vascular B-ultrasound and pathology aided in establishing a clear and timely diagnosis, which allowed systematic medical treatment to be delivered, achieving good short-term results."

    "abstract": "Terrorist events in the form of explosive devices have occurred and remain a threat currently to the population and the infrastructure of many nations worldwide. Injuries occur from a combination of a blast wave, energised fragments, blunt trauma and burns. The relative preponderance of each injury mechanism is dependent on the type of device, distance to targets, population density and the surrounding environment, such as an enclosed space, to name but a few. One method of primary prevention of such injuries is by modification of the environment in which the explosion occurs, such as modifying population density and the design of enclosed spaces. The Human Injury Predictor (HIP) tool is a computational model which was developed to predict the pattern of injuries following an explosion with the goal to inform national injury prevention strategies from terrorist attacks. HIP currently uses algorithms to predict the effects from primary and secondary blast and allows the geometry of buildings to be incorporated. It has been validated using clinical data from the '7/7' terrorist attacks in London and the 2017 Manchester Arena terrorist event. Although the tool can be used readily, it will benefit from further development to refine injury representation, validate injury scoring and enable the prediction of triage states. The tool can assist both in the design of future buildings and methods of transport, as well as the situation of critical emergency services required in the response following a terrorist explosive event. The aim of this paper is to describe the HIP tool in its current version and provide a roadmap for optimising its utility in the future for the protection of national infrastructure and the population."

Although an intra-peritoneal source of infection was not detected preoperatively, an exploratory laparotomy was performed at 3 h after her arrival. During the surgery, bilateral salpingitis was observed. Peritoneal drainage was performed. Meropenem was administered and she was extubated on the next day. GAS was detected in the vaginal fluid culture and ascitic fluid culture. Antibiotics therapy was completed on postoperative day 9 and the patient was discharged on day 10 without any complications. A literature review was performed using the following algorithm: \"(group A streptococcus OR streptococcus pyogenes) AND (peritonitis)\". All case reports and case series published in English after 1990 were reviewed. Fifty-six reports including 65 cases were eligible. There was a strong sex difference, with 80% of cases being female.

Selective immobilization has been shown to be safe and effective for emergency medical services use, but it is unclear whether such protocols reduce unnecessary and potentially harmful immobilization practices. This study evaluated the impact of a selective spinal immobilization protocol on practice patterns in a regional trauma system. All encounters for traumatic injury in the Tidewater Emergency Medical Services region from 2010 to 2016 were extracted from the Virginia Pre-Hospital Information Bridge. An interrupted time series analysis was used to assess practice change after system-wide protocol implementation in 2013. Intravenous access was used as a nonequivalent outcome measure in the absence of an appropriate control group. A total of 63,981 encounters were analyzed. At baseline, 16.7% of patients underwent full immobilization. The preprotocol slope was slightly positive (0.2% per month; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.2%). Slope and level changes after protocol implementation did not differ from those observed for intravenous access (-0.4% vs. -0.4% per month [ p = 0.4917] and -1.6% vs. -1.1% [ p = 0.1202], respectively). Cervical spinal immobilization became more common over the postimplementation period (0.1% per month; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.1%). Rates of immobilization for isolated penetrating trauma remained unchanged. Implementation of a selective spinal immobilization protocol did not reduce prehospital immobilization rates in a regional trauma system. Given the entrenched nature of immobilization practices, more intensive education and training strategies are needed. Efforts should prioritize eliminating immobilization for isolated penetrating trauma given its association with increased mortality. Therapeutic/Care Management; Level IV."

    "abstract": "Congenital bowel malrotation resulting in midgut volvulus is traditionally regarded as a diagnosis of infancy. Rarely, congenital bowel malrotation is diagnosed in adolescents or adults and requires a high index of suspicion. Presentations can be acute or chronic, and physical examination findings are nonspecific. Diagnosis is primarily achieved through abdominal computed tomography (CT) or during exploratory laparotomy. The pathophysiology in late-onset malrotation is similar to neonatal malrotation, with a division of Ladd's bands - peritoneal fibrous bands that connect the cecum to the right lower quadrant retroperitoneum - as the definitive treatment. We present a case of congenital bowel malrotation in an adolescent with persistent and worsening migratory abdominal pain. An 18-year-old female presented to the emergency department with two days of poorly localized abdominal pain and nausea. Initial evaluation was unremarkable and she was discharged home with a diagnosis of constipation. She returned two days later with worsening abdominal pain and new onset emesis. Given her persistent and worsening symptoms an abdominal CT was performed, which revealed malrotation of the bowel. Taken together, her CT findings and abdominal symptoms were concerning for symptomatic congenital bowel malrotation and she underwent a Ladd procedure. She remained asymptomatic both at discharge and at two-week postoperative follow-up. Symptomatic congenital bowel malrotation is more common in older children and adults than has traditionally been thought. Physicians must consider this diagnosis in their differential when working up a patient for acute or chronic intermittent abdominal pain to prevent potentially severe sequelae."

On chest CT findings, the knife was observed to be inserted through the 4th intercostal space, penetrating the lungs. The tip of the knife appeared to be anchored to the dorsal side of the 9th intercostal space. We found no damage to the heart, only a 2-cm-long and 1-cm-deep cut in the lingular segment area. We confirmed that the amount of bleeding in the inserted drain was an indicator of non-macrovascular injury. In cases of chest trauma, chest tube drainage and hemodynamics should always be observed, and the potential need for emergency surgery should be considered."

Clinical characteristics, endoscopic and imaging diagnostic features, histological findings, surgical procedures and outcomes in these patients were studied. Three patients were included in this case series. Mean age of presentation was 49.0 years with two male and one female patient. All three patients presented with melena and hemodynamic instability, resuscitated with adequate blood transfusions. Routine endoscopic assessment were inconclusive.

    "abstract": "Bowel obstruction is a surgical emergency that leads to a high rate of admissions. Twenty percent of patients with acute abdominal pain will be diagnosed with bowel obstruction; eighty percent of them are of small origin. It is classified based on etiology to either mechanical or functional. Mechanical obstruction is a physical barrier that obstructs the passage of bowel content; it could be caused by adhesion, tumors, volvulus, hernias, strictures, and gallstone ileus. Functional obstruction is usually due to impaired peristalsis or metabolic disorders. In this article, we report a case of an 80-year-old gentleman with no previous surgical history who was found to have a bowel obstruction. Diagnostic imaging and colonoscopy showed that his clinical presentation was due to gallstone ileus with cholecysto-enteric fistula and sigmoid mass. He underwent exploratory laparotomy with small bowel resection and sigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis and diverting ileostomy. The final pathology showed early moderately differentiated polyp adenocarcinoma T1N0 and was kept on surveillance. The novelty of this case is the presentation of two different abdominal pathologies, which lead to large and small bowel obstruction. Thus, the management decision was challenging, and a thorough workup is advisable in such cases."

Multiple blunt intra-abdominal organs that rupture in conjunction with a ruptured aorta are terrible and rare. A 65-year-old man sustained critical injuries during a traffic collision between a motorcycle and truck. The Injury Severity Score was 42 points,. After open abdominal exploration, we repaired the left diaphragmatic rupture with a 13-cm-long tear of IV grade (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma), resected partial small bowel, simple suture of the transverse colon, and Hartmann procedure in the descending colon. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed 22 h after laparotomy. Reconstruction of the head depicting a cheekbone fracture and inferior to the left orbital bone was performed on the 14th day. The patients survived and were discharged from the hospital, at 22 days without morbidity or mortality. Diaphragmatic rupture provides a signal to relate head, thoracic, and abdominal blunt trauma. If the patient sustains more serious life-threatening injuries that require emergency laparotomy or craniotomy, and aortic repair may be delayed. Laparotomy is the best initial surgical method in this case. TEVAR is a feasible and gold standard procedure for the treatment of patients with the necessary indications. It is essential to evaluate the level of organ damage to properly coordinate the specialists. The timing of the operation and therapeutic alternatives should be decided for each patient."

Pneumothorax has been established as a complication in the literature. However, tension pneumothorax remains a rare presentation with higher mortality. We report a case of secondary tension pneumothorax in a patient following apparent recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonitis. Eight days after resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonitis symptoms, a 51-year-old Caucasian man with no pre-existing pulmonary disease was brought into the emergency department following 48 hours of progressive shortness of breath. Further clinical assessment revealed reduced breath sounds in the right lung, blood pressure was 116/95 mmHg, and jugular venous pressure was not elevated. Chest x-ray showed right-sided tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift. Insertion of a chest drain led to rapid resolution of symptoms, and the patient was discharged following full re-expansion of the lung. The period of recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 is variable. Clinicians should consider tension pneumothorax as a possible complication of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonitis in patients presenting with type 1 respiratory failure, even after resolution of pneumonitis symptoms and a considerable time period following initial contraction of coronavirus disease 2019."

    "abstract": "Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency, caused by rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardium resulting in reduced ventricular filling which may result in pulmonary oedema, shock and death. The common causes of cardiac tamponade include malignancy, uraemia, infectious/idiopathic pericarditis, connective tissue diseases, post-cardiac surgery etc. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying cause of the tamponade along with pericardiocentesis improves the prognosis, otherwise untreated cardiac tamponade universally results in death. We report a rare case of 32-year-old man, who presented with cardiac tamponade due to a pancreatico-pericardial fistula secondary to pancreatitis and was successfully treated by endoscopic therapy."

    "title": "Association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) patterns and mortality: a retrospective case-control study.",
    "abstract": "Background: Low and medium income countries (LMICs) such as Kenya experience nearly three times more cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to high income countries (HICs). This is primarily exacerbated by weak health systems especially at the pre-hospital care level. Generating local empirical evidence on TBI patterns and its influence on patient mortality outcomes is fundamental in informing the design of trauma-specific emergency medical service (EMS) interventions at the pre-hospital care level. This study determines the influence of TBI patterns and mortality. Methods: This was a case-control study with a sample of 316 TBI patients. Data was abstracted from medical records for the period of January 2017 to March 2019 in three tertiary trauma care facilities in Kenya. Logistic regression was used to assess influence of trauma patterns on TBI mortality, controlling for patient characteristics and other potential confounders. Results: The majority of patients were aged below 40 years (73%) and were male (85%). Road traffic injuries (RTIs) comprised 58% of all forms of trauma. Blunt trauma comprised 71% of the injuries. Trauma mechanism was the only trauma pattern significantly associated with TBI mortality. The risk of dying for patients sustaining RTIs was 2.83 times more likely compared to non-RTI patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-4.93, p=0.001]. The type of transfer to hospital was also significantly associated with mortality outcome, with a public hospital having a two times higher risk of death compared to a private hospital [OR 2.18 95%CI 1.21-3.94, p<0.009]. Conclusion: Trauma mechanism (RTI vs non-RTI) and type of tertiary facility patients are transferred to (public vs private) are key factors influencing TBI mortality burden. Strengthening local EMS trauma response systems targeting RTIs augmented by adequately resourced and equipped public facilities to provide quality lifesaving interventions can reduce the burden of TBIs."

    "title": "Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation can be safely performed without invasive hemodynamic monitoring: A multi-center study.",
    "abstract": "Arterial invasive monitoring is the most common method in the USA for hemodynamic monitoring during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. Although studies have shown favorable comparison between non-invasive and invasive hemodynamic monitoring (IHM) in non-cardiac procedures under general anesthesia, limited data is available for complex cardiac procedures such as AF ablation in the USA. With progressive improvement in AF ablation procedural safety, particularly with routine use of intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) to monitor for pericardial effusion, it is unclear if invasive hemodynamic monitoring provides any advantage over non-invasive methods. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring is non-inferior to invasive hemodynamic monitoring during AF ablation under general anesthesia in patients without major cardiac structural abnormality. A multi-center retrospective data of AF ablation from July 2019 to December 2020 was extracted. A total of three hundred and sixty-two patients (362) were included, which were divided into group A (non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring) and group B (invasive hemodynamic monitoring). The primary outcome was to compare procedural safety between the two groups. Out of 362 patients, 184 (51%) received non-invasive and 178 (49%) received invasive hemodynamic monitoring with similar baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference between the two groups in complication rates (groin hematoma, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade). Mean procedure time was longer in group B with 3.35% arterial site discomfort. Urgent arterial access was required in only 1 patient in group A. This retrospective multicenter study strongly suggests that catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation under general anesthesia can be safely performed with noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring without requiring arterial access, with potential benefit in procedural duration and cost."

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in combination with shock has been associated with hypocoagulability. However, recent data suggest that TBI itself can promote a systemic procoagulant state via the release of brain-derived extracellular vesicles. The objective of our study was to identify if TBI was associated with differences in thrombelastography indices when controlling for other variables associated with coagulopathy following trauma. We hypothesized that TBI is independently associated with a less coagulopathic state. Prospective study includes all highest-level trauma activations at an urban Level I trauma center, from 2014 to 2020. Traumatic brain injury was defined as Abbreviated Injury Scale head score greater than 3. Blood samples were drawn at emergency department admission. Linear regression was used to assess the role of independent predictors on trauma induced coagulopathy. Models adjusted for Injury Severity Score (ISS), shock (defined as ED SBP<70, or ED SBP<90 and ED HR>108, or first hospital base deficit >10), and prehospital Glasgow Coma Scale score. Of the 1,023 patients included, 291 (28%) suffered a TBI. Traumatic brain injury patients more often were female (26% vs. 19%, p = 0.01), had blunt trauma (83% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001), shock (33% vs. 25%, p = 0.009), and higher median ISS (29 vs. 10, p < 0.0001). Fibrinolysis shutdown (25% vs. 18%) was more common in the TBI group (p < 0.0001). When controlled for the confounding effects of ISS and shock, the presence of TBI independently decreases lysis at 30 minutes (LY30) (beta estimate: -0.16 ± 0.06, p = 0.004). This effect of TBI on LY30 persisted when controlling for sex and mechanism of injury in addition to ISS and shock (beta estimate: -0.13 ± 0.06, p = 0.022). Traumatic brain injury is associated with lower LY30 independent of shock, tissue injury, sex, and mechanism of injury. These findings suggest a propensity toward a hypercoagulable state in patients with TBI, possibly due to fibrinolysis shutdown. Prognostic and Epidemiologic; Level III."

A retrospective, single-centre study was conducted over a 4-year period (1/1/16-31/12/19) of children (<16 years old) presenting to the Emergency Department with penetrating trauma. Clinical, radiographic, and demographic data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Fifty-eight patients in >60 attendances were reviewed. Most (44/60, 73%) underwent some imaging, with almost half (28/60, 47%) having both computed tomography (CT) and radiography. Of cases with only a single injury site (35/60, 58%), CT was performed in 19/35 (54%) with 13/19 (68%) covering more than one body area. Of the multi-injury site cases (26/60, 42%), CT was performed in 16/25 (64%) with 14/16 (88%) involving multiple body areas. The most common injuries were solid-organ lacerations and soft-tissue and vascular injuries according to body site involved. Contrast-enhanced CT across multiple body parts should be performed for multiple stab wounds or visible injuries involving the torso. Isolated penetrating injuries may only require CT of a single body part unless the entry wound crosses body parts. An imaging algorithm is suggested, which may be applicable to other paediatric trauma units."

This is a single-center, retrospective, electrocardiogram-based artificial intelligence (AI) system study that included 107 ECGs from 98 pneumothorax patients. Seven patients received needle decompression due to tension pneumothorax, and the others received thoracostomy due to instability (respiratory rate ≥ 24 breaths/min; heart rate, < 60 beats/min or > 120 beats/min; hypotension; room air O2 saturation, < 90%; and patient could not speak in whole sentences between breaths). Traumatic pneumothorax and bilateral pneumothorax were excluded. The ECGs of 132,127 patients presenting to the emergency department without pneumothorax were used as the control group. The development cohort included approximately 80% of the ECGs for training the deep learning model (DLM), and the other 20% of ECGs were used to validate the performance. A human-machine competition involving three physicians was conducted to assess the model performance. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) of the DLM in the validation cohort and competition set were 0.947 and 0.957, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of our DLM were 94.7% and 88.1% in the validation cohort, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of all physicians. Our DLM could also recognize the location of pneumothorax with 100% accuracy. Lead-specific analysis showed that lead I ECG made a major contribution, achieving an AUC of 0.930 (94.7% sensitivity, 86.0% specificity). The inclusion of the patient characteristics allowed our AI system to achieve an AUC of 0.994. The present AI system may assist the medical system in the early identification of pneumothorax through 12-lead ECG, and it performs as well with lead I ECG alone as with 12-lead ECG."

Our institutional WBCT protocol allows for easy inclusion of the lower extremities, circumventing the need for diagnostic radiographs of the lower extremities. We hypothesized that this WBCT protocol would decrease time in the ED, reduce time to ED discharge, and decrease the number of lower extremity radiographs obtained in this patient population. To assess patient throughput in the ED by determining total time in the ED, number of lower extremity radiographs, cost of radiographs, and total cost of imaging before and after the implementation of a WBCT protocol for trauma. The trauma registry from an urban level 1 trauma center was searched for blunt trauma patients 6 months before and 6 months after the implementation of a WBCT protocol for trauma. Time between admission and discharge from the ED, total number of radiographs, total radiographs cost, total cost of ED imaging, and radiation dose estimations before and after WBCT implementation were calculated. There was a statistically significant decrease in time in the ED (76 min, p = 0.033) and number of lower extremity radiographs (decreased by 2 per patient, p < 0.01) following the implementation of the WBCT for trauma protocol. The cost of radiographs was decreased by 28.5% (p = 0.013) but the total cost of ED imaging was increased by approximately 4 × (p < 0.0001). Calculated effective radiation dose to the lower extremities increased by a factor of 1.9 × after implementation of WBCT for trauma. Implementation of a WBCT protocol for trauma resulted in statistically significant decreased time in the ED and decreased the number of radiographs at the expense of increased imaging costs and radiation exposure."

The epidemiological parameters associated with ocular trauma vary in different populations, especially in children. The objective of this study was to assess the ocular trauma epidemiology in children less than 18 years of age. In this cross-sectional study, 145 children (under 18 years) with ocular trauma who referred to the emergency department of Bu-Ali-Sina Hospital in Sari, Iran were enrolled from November 2017 to January 2019. Of the participants, 57.9% were men, 70.4% had blunt trauma, 97.2% had a unilateral eye injury, and 54.5% had a right eye injury. The most risk factor for trauma was stationery (51.0%). Almost half of the patients (52.9%) had corneal injuries. The most trauma locations were at home (67.4%). Most patients (95.0%) had normal relative afferent pupillary defects. Blunt (52.6% vs. 47.4%) and penetrating (72.5% vs. 27.5%) traumas was higher in boys than girls (p=0.03). Most frequent part of eye injuries in blunt and penetrating traumas was related to the cornea (P=0.04).

Preoperative diagnosis of SBV is a challenge because of the absence of pathognomonic clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings. Surgery represents the correct treatment of SBV. A 69-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of abdominal pain, inability to pass gas or stool, nausea, vomiting. Physical examination revealed abdominal distension, generalized abdominal pain without guarding or rebound tenderness, a partially reducible and painless right inguinal hernia. Laboratory tests reported neutrophilic leukocytosis. Abdominal computed tomography revealed massive gastroduodenal dilatation with pneumoperitoneum and small bowel loops in the right inguinal sac. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy: a jejunal volvulus (JV) located within the right inguinal hernia sac, causing gastrointestinal obstruction, was devolvulated and a right prosthetic inguinal hernia repair was also performed. The patient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day. Secondary SBV is due to any congenital or acquired lesions and rarely occurs among adults in Western countries. This is the first literature report of a JV located within an inguinal hernia sac causing gastrointestinal obstruction. Secondary JV represents an extremely rare abdominal emergency necessitating early diagnosis to prevent the development of intestinal ischemia, bowel necrosis and peritonitis. Diagnosis of JV needs a high index of suspicion and may be facilitated by imaging, often it is made intraoperatively. Surgery represents the appropriate treatment of JV."

    "abstract": "Subclavian (SC) and transapical (TA) approaches are the main alternatives to the default femoral delivery for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of this study was to compare complications and morbidity/mortality associated with SC and TA in a long-term time frame. From January 2007 to July 2015, 1506 patients underwent TAVI surgery in 36 United Kingdom TAVI centers. Primary outcomes were complications according to VARC-2 criteria. The secondary outcome was long-term survival. The enrolled patients were distributed as follows: 1216 in the TA group and 290 in the SC group. There were no differences in the rates of acute myocardial infarction, emergency valve-in-valve, paravalvular leak, balloon post dilatation, cardiac tamponade, stroke, renal replacement therapy, vascular injuries, and 30-day mortality among the groups. Conversely, the rate of permanent pacemaker implantation (p = .02), the procedural time duration (p = .04), and the 12-month mortality (p = .03) was higher in SC than in TA, while in-hospital length of stay was reduced in SC than in TA (p = .01). Up to 8 years, the long-term mortality was not different among groups (p = .77), and no difference in long-term survival between self- versus balloon-expandable devices was found (p = .26). According to our results, TA provided the best 12-month survival compared to SC, while the long-term survival up to 2900 days is not significantly different between groups, so SC and TA may both represent a safe non-femoral access if femoral is precluded."

If left untreated it can lead to serious consequences such as rupture and fatal haemorrhage. A 17 year old male presented to the emergency department with a history of intermittent progressive epigastric pain with no preceding significant symptoms of a possible cause. He was initially treated conservatively until the intensity of pain was so severe an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was justified. A pseudoaneurysm of the SMA was found. Full inflammatory and immunological workup was unremarkable. Repeat CT scan showed the SMA pseudoaneurysm was larger, mandating surgical intervention; the vascular surgeon suggested an exploratory laparotomy. Intra-operatively, unexpectedly, a wooden foreign body measuring 5.0 × 0.3 × 0.5 cm was seen once the aneurysm sac was opened. The pseudoaneurysm was repaired and the abdomen closed after ascertaining that all other organs were intact. The patient had a simple recovery with no complications and was discharged home. The follow up CT scans were unremarkable. Pseudoaneurysm of the SMA in the paediatric age group is an extremely rare and life threatening phenomenon. The clinical presentation may be subtle, leading to delayed diagnosis. Early surgical intervention may be lifesaving and prevent further complications."

These tumors are usually clinically silent and are discovered on autopsy. We present a case of a 62-year-old woman, known diabetic, hypertensive, and hypothyroid patient, who presented with complaints of abdominal distention and obstipation with multiple episodes of vomiting undigested food particles for three days. She had been passing dark tarry stools infrequently for over a month. She complained of a progressive loss of appetite and 5 kg weight loss over a month. Her examination revealed pallor and irregular pulse with a rate of 94/min. She had a distended non-tender abdomen and absent bowel sounds. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen showed circumferential thickening of the descending colon, causing acute stenosis with multiple liver metastases and enlarged pericolic lymph nodes. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated, 55.45 ng/mL. She underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy with transverse loop colostomy. Histopathology report showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. ECG showed atrial fibrillation and two-dimensional echocardiogram showed right ventricular metastasis. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) thorax was done to confirm the diagnosis. The common sites of metastases from colorectal cancer are the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs. When cardiac metastasis occurs, it often presents with features of heart failure. Our patient presented with atrial fibrillation. As the incidence of cardiac metastasis is quite rare, there is no standard established treatment. Certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX regimen), have been shown to improve cardiac metastases. Due to the extensive spread of primary cancer in our patient, she was planned for palliative chemotherapy; however, the patient expired before initiation of therapy."

    "abstract": "A 19-year-old with blunt trauma and repeated nose blowing presented with orbital emphysema and orbital compartment syndrome. Orbital emphysema is the abnormal presence of air within the orbit, typically secondary to trauma. Most cases will resolve with observation alone, however orbital compartment syndrome is a feared complication that necessitates urgent decompression. A superior fornix, trans-conjunctival approach was safely utilized to decompress the orbit while avoiding unwanted complications. Various decompression techniques have previously been described, most of which describe trans-palpebral approaches. The key safety benefit to the trans-conjunctival approach is direct visualization of the needle tip adjacent to the superior fornix, therefore posterior to the equator of the globe. With the needle positioned parallel to the curvature of the globe at the equator, the posterior sclera surface curves away from the tip, rendering it difficult to pierce the globe. In addition, the needle needs to be advanced only 3-4 millimeters and traverses only the conjunctiva and Tenon's to enter the central surgical space - the most direct route to the air pocket. The trans-conjunctival approach lowers the risk of damage to eyelid neurovascular structures and is less painful."

    "abstract": "Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) represents less than 0.5% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Clinical manifestations are non-specific and diagnosis is delayed in the majority of patients. 85-year-old woman reporting accidental fall at home 20-days earlier, was admitted with diagnosed of acute abdomen from suspected two-stage rupture of the spleen. The patient complained of pain in the upper abdomen. Blood-chemical tests did not show anemia and leukocytosis, but showed increased CA19.9, CA125, LDH and beta2- microglobulin. Contrast-enhanced CT showed left pleural, perisplenic, perihepatic, and Douglas blood effusion, a neoformation of the body-tail of the pancreas with peri-pancreatic blood layer, splenomegaly due to the presence of a hypodense area as from intraparenchymal hematoma, with an apparently undamaged splenic capsule. The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, that revealed the presence of modest free serohematic effusion from oozing of the pancreatic neoformation. The local spread of the disease prevented any attempt at surgical resection. Bleeding was checked with the addition of topical hemostats (Tabotamp®) and biopsy sampling of the pancreatic mass was performed. A final histological diagnosis of large cell NHL of centro-follicular origin, double expressor for the CMYC and BCL2 protein, was achieved. The age of the patient, the poor general conditions, the associated pathologies, the locally advanced spread of the disease and the histological aggressiveness, were contraindications to chemo-radiotherapy treatments. The initial misdiagnosis was due to the history of recent trauma, the uncommon clinical presentation, the underestimation of the serum increase in markers and the interpretation of the CT. Acute Abdomen, Hemoperitoneum, Primary Pancreatic Lymphoma. Il linfoma pancreatico primitivo (PPL) rappresenta meno dello 0.5% di tutte le neoplasie pancreatiche. Le manifestazioni cliniche di esordio non sono specifiche e la diagnosi è tardiva nella maggioranza dei pazienti. OSSERVAZIONE PERSONALE: Donna di 85 anni, ricoverata presso l’Ospedale Universitario “A. Fiorini” di Terracina- Polo Pontino, con diagnosi di addome acuto da sospetta rottura in due tempi della milza. Al ricovero la pz lamentava dolore a carico dei quadranti addominali superiori e riferiva caduta accidentale in casa avvenuta 20 giorni prima. Presentava esami ematochimici negativi per anemia e leucocitosi (Hb12.7g/dl; GB9.8x10/UL), significativo incremento del CA19.9 (196 U/ml), del CA125 (138 U/ml), delle LDH (1044 U/L) e della beta2-microglobulina. La CT torace-addome-pelvi con mdc mostrava versamento a densità ematica in sede pleurica sinistra, perisplenica, periepatica e nel Douglas e una neoformazione del corpo-coda pancreas con falda ematica peripancreatica. La milza appariva di dimensioni notevolmente aumentate, con presenza di area ipodensa di 12.5x10.6 cm di diametro come da ematoma intraparenchimale, con capsula splenica apparentemente indenne. La pz veniva sottoposta a laparotomia esplorativa urgente per sospetto emoperitoneo. All’apertura della cavità peritoneale si dimostrava la presenza di modesto versamento libero sieroematico da stillicidio della neoformazione pancreatica. La diffusione locale della malattia impediva ogni tentativo di resezione chirurgica. Si procedeva a controllo del sanguinamento con apposizione di emostatici topici (Tabotamp®) e a prelievo bioptico dalla neoformazione pancreatica. Si poneva diagnosi istologica finale di Linfoma Non-Hodgkin a grandi cellule di origine centro- follicolare, doppio espressore per la proteina CMYC e BCL2 all’immunoistochimica. L’età della pz, le scadenti condizioni generali, le patologie associate in trattamento poli-farmacologico, la diffusione localmente avanzata della malattia e l’aggressività istologica controindicavano il trattamento chemioradioterapico. CONCLUSIONE: La diagnosi di PPL è molto difficile e tardiva nella maggioranza dei pz, poichè le manifestazioni cliniche di esordio sono di solito aspecifiche; così come nel caso da noi riportato in cui il sanguinamento intraretro- peritoneale era difficilmente riconducibile ad una malattia pancreatica. I riferito trauma addominale, la sintomatologia clinica aspecifica, la CT in cui non erano state evidenziate le alterazioni caratteristiche dei linfomi extranodali, la sottovalutazione dell’aumento dei livelli plasmatici dei marcatori CA19-9 e CA125, delle LDH e della beta2- microglobulina, sono state nel nostro caso la causa di errata diagnosi e indicazione al trattamento chirurgico in urgenza."

    "title": "Transmediastinal penetrating trauma.",
    "abstract": "Penetrating transmediastinal injury (TMI) is associated with a high mortality rate and presents a challenging diagnostic scenario. Previous dogma mandated surgical exploration or extensive and invasive investigations for all patients sustaining transmediastinal penetrating trauma, regardless of hemodynamic status. Since the late 1990s, the paradigm has changed, with most centers adopting a tiered approach to management based on clinical presentation. Transmediastinal penetrating trauma is a rare injury pattern and can result from gunshot wounds, stab wounds, blast injuries, and other missiles. The most predominant source, however, remains gunshot wounds, accounting for the vast majority of these injuries. A systematic approach in the emergency department to diagnosis and management should be undertaken and patients in extremis or with hemodynamic compromise rapidly identified. The unstable patient forgoes further investigations and the surgeon must use knowledge about the hypothesized trajectory, results of limited imaging, chest tube output, and anticipation of resuscitative maneuvers to select the best operative approach. In patients who are sufficiently stable to undergo CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest, the trajectory of the missile or impalement can often be deduced and this is used to guide further investigation or operation. In those where ambiguity remains, more focused tests such as echocardiography, pericardial window, esophagoscopy or esophagography, and bronchoscopy can be used to assess the mediastinal structures. For the stable patient, management proceeds with cautious and expeditious investigations to determine the extent of underlying organ-specific injuries. Thus, in patients with this injury pattern, determination of the patient's clinical status is critical to determine the appropriate course of management."

    "abstract": "Intestinal malrotation is usually diagnosed in early childhood. It results from failure of the normal gut rotation during embryological development. We present a case of a 62-year-old woman with a delayed presentation of an intestinal malrotation. She was admitted in the emergency department with an acute intestinal obstruction. Exploratory laparotomy revealed Ladd's band with caecum volvulus and intestinal malrotation. Ladd's procedure and right hemicolectomy were performed with uneventful recovery. Since both caecum volvulus and intestinal malrotation are rare events, particularly in adulthood, clinical diagnosis is challenging. Our aim is to increase the awareness of surgeons about this rare association as a cause of acute intestinal obstruction."

The development of mediastinitis in a patient after haemithyroidectomy under general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation due to esophagus injury is a very rare condition. Our patient's early post-operative period was complicated by severe pain behind the sternum not associated with acute coronary syndrome. On the second post-operative day, our suspicions of mediastinitis were not definitively supported by diagnostic tests. On the fourth post-operative day, the patient experienced septic shock, necessitating emergent repeated oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, which located the injury of oesophagus. Emergent torachotomy for mediastinitis, gastrostomy and mediastinal drainage was conducted on the fourth post-operative day. Despite aggressive surgical and critical care management, the patient died 3 days after. Death was caused by mediastinitis complicated by severe sepsis and multiple organ failure. On autopsy, the damage to the posterior wall of the oesophagus occurred as a result of penetrating trauma to cervical and thoracic spine osteophytes during hemithyroidectomy. The pathology section revealed that acute angle osteophytes located at the cervical level injured the oesophagus when the pressure was applied in removing part of the thyroid gland with malignant neoplasia."

    "abstract": "There is a plethora of trauma scoring systems currently in place. A lot of these scoring systems, however, are complex and thus have a limited utility in the emergency department. The present study was conducted to evaluate the relatively easy to calculate quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) Score in blunt trauma victims. We ought to study its utility in predicting outcomes in blunt trauma patients and its usefulness to guide resource allocation in the emergency department. A prospective observational study was performed on blunt trauma patients who had presented to the emergency department of our tertiary care center, over a period of 6 months. Their qSOFA scores were calculated and these patients were observed for their course in the hospital. The predictive validity of this score was then studied for the outcome prediction in these patients. A total of 246 patients were enrolled. Maximum 36.4% of patients had a qSOFA score of 0 and 10.1% were with a score of 3. Higher qSOFA scores were associated with higher in-hospital mortality, higher needs for an ICU admission, higher needs for mechanical ventilation. However, it did not reliably predict the need for an emergency surgery in these patients. qSOFA score serves as a reliable tool to predict adverse outcomes in blunt trauma victims. It helps with the quick allocation of resources in the emergency department."

    "abstract": "Exploratory laparotomy is considered the gold standard treatment for women with suspected uterine rupture. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopy as an alternative for laparotomy for the management of hemodynamically stable women with suspected postpartum uterine rupture. We conducted a case series study including all women who were diagnosed with postpartum uterine rupture following vaginal delivery in a university-affiliated tertiary hospital, between November 2012 and July 2021. Until 2016, all women with suspected post-partum uterine rupture underwent laparotomy. Following 2016, a new tailored protocol based on laparoscopy for the management of postpartum uterine rupture in hemodynamically stable women was implemented. A comparison was made between women who underwent emergent laparoscopy to laparotomy. During the study period 17 women were diagnosed with postpartum uterine rupture. From January 2012 to January 2016, four cases of uterine rupture were diagnosed, all of whom underwent laparotomy. Since 2016, thirteen cases of uterine rupture were diagnosed, of whom seven women (54%) underwent laparoscopy and 6 (46%) laparotomy. The median time interval from delivery to surgery was 70.5 min IQR (40-179) in the laparotomy group and 202 min IQR (70-485) in the laparoscopy group. The median operative time for laparoscopic surgery was 80 min (IQR 60-114) and 78 min (IQR 58-114) for the laparotomy group. Four women who underwent laparotomy (40%) and one who underwent laparoscopy (14.2%) were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery. Blood products transfusion was required in six women who had laparotomy (60%) and one who had laparoscopy (14.2%). Median hospitalization period was 5 d IQR (4-5) in the laparotomy group as compared to 3 d IQR (3-4) in the laparoscopy group. There were no conversions to laparotomy in the laparoscopy group. In hemodynamic stable women laparoscopic surgery for suspected postpartum uterine rupture is feasible and safe."

    "abstract": "Obstructive shock describes any disease process that causes physical obstruction to blood flow into or out of the heart which results in impaired systemic oxygen or nutrient delivery. Common etiologies include cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolus. However, several other causes exist and should prompt consideration in the correct clinical circumstances. In this report, we describe a 72-year-old female patient with history of hepatic cysts presenting with respiratory distress, mottled extremities, and abnormal vital signs. Contrast enhanced computed tomography scans showed a massive hepatic cyst which was compressing her vena cava and heart, causing hemodynamic instability. The patient was admitted to the ICU and the hepatic cyst was drained percutaneously, but ultimately, she succumbed to her illness post-operatively. This report highlights the importance of keeping a broad differential when considering etiologies of undifferentiated shock as well as the need for additional research regarding management of rare causes of obstructive shock."

    "abstract": "Syphilitic aortitis is a rare complication of tertiary syphilis, which can lead to aortic aneurysm formation, aortic valvular insufficiency, and ostial coronary stenosis. Syphilis has re-emerged worldwide over recent decades and vascular surgeons should be aware of its cardiovascular manifestations. Atypical clinical presentation, such as hemoptysis and a computed tomography angiography pattern of a thicker aneurysmal wall with ulcer-like aneurysm projections, should raise suspicion of syphilitic aortic aneurysm. An early diagnosis and appropriate surgical and medical therapies significantly contribute to successful treatment and favorable prognosis. Herein is reported the case of an 82-year-old male patient, positive for syphilis infection, with impending aortic arch aneurysm rupture treated with a hybrid arch repair. After 7 months, the patient was brought to the emergency room in cardiac arrest. Unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers were performed, and an autopsy showed cardiac tamponade due to rupture of the ascending aorta. A aortite sifilítica é uma complicação rara da sífilis terciária, que pode levar a formação de aneurisma aórtico, insuficiência valvar aórtica e estenose ostial coronariana. Ao longo das últimas décadas, a sífilis ressurgiu ao redor do mundo, e os cirurgiões vasculares devem estar atentos às suas manifestações cardiovasculares. Apresentações clínicas atípicas, como a hemoptise, e um padrão na angiotomografia computadorizada de parede aneurismática mais grossa com projeções de aneurisma com aparência de úlcera devem levantar a suspeita de aneurisma sifilítico da aorta. O diagnóstico precoce e terapias cirúrgica e clínica adequadas contribuem significativamente para um tratamento bem-sucedido e prognóstico favorável. Relatamos o caso de um paciente do sexo masculino, de 82 anos, que apresentou infecção por sífilis com ruptura iminente de aneurisma do arco aórtico. Ele foi tratado com reparo híbrido do arco. Após 7 meses, o paciente deu entrada na emergência com parada cardiorrespiratória. As manobras de reanimação cardiopulmonar foram realizadas, mas não obtiveram sucesso, e a autópsia mostrou tamponamento cardíaco devido à ruptura da aorta ascendente."

    "abstract": "Resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) is an intervention that can be performed in the prehospital setting for relieving cardiac tamponade and/or obtaining vascular control of suspected sub-diaphragmatic haemorrhage in patients in traumatic cardiac arrest. The aim of this retrospective case study is to compare the rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in RTs performed for both penetrating and blunt trauma over 6 years in a mixed urban and rural environment. The electronic records of a single helicopter emergency medical service were reviewed between 1st June 2015 and 31st May 2021 for RTs. Anonymised data including demographics were extracted for relevant cases. Data were analysed with independent t-tests and Χ2 tests. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Forty-four RTs were preformed within the 6 years (26 for blunt trauma). Eleven ROSCs were achieved (nine blunt, two penetrating) but no patient survived to discharge. In contrast to RTs for penetrating trauma, twelve of the RTs for blunt trauma had a cardiac output present on arrival of the prehospital team (p = 0.01). Two patients had an RT performed in a helicopter (one ROSC) and two on a helipad (both achieving ROSC), likely due to the longer transfer times seen in a more rural setting. Four of the RTs for blunt trauma (15%) were found to have a cardiac tamponade versus seven (39%) of the penetrating trauma RTs. Prehospital RT remains a procedure with low rates of survival but may facilitate a ROSC to allow patients to reach hospital and surgery, particularly when distances to hospitals are greater. A higher-than-expected rate of cardiac tamponade was seen in RTs for blunt trauma, although not caused by a right ventricular wound but instead due to underlying vessel damage."

    "abstract": "The impact of interhospital transfer on outcomes of patients undergoing emergency general surgery (EGS) procedures is incompletely studied. We set out to determine if transfer before definitive surgical care leads to worse outcomes in EGS patients. Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database (2013-2019), a retrospective cohort study was conducted including nine surgical procedures encompassing 80% of the burden of EGS diseases, performed on an urgent/emergent basis. The procedures were classified as low risk (open and laparoscopic appendectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy) and high risk (open cholecystectomy, laparoscopic and open colectomy, lysis of adhesions, perforated ulcer repair, small bowel resection, and exploratory laparotomy). Time to surgery was recorded in days. The impact of interhospital transfer on outcomes (mortality, major complications, 30-day reoperations, and 30-day readmissions) and length of stay, according to procedure risk and time to surgery, were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression and inverse probability treatment of the weighting with treatment effect in the treated. A total of 329,613 patients were included in the study (284,783 direct admission and 44,830 transfers). Adjusted mortality (3.1% vs. 10.4%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.28; p < 0.001), major complications (6.7% vs. 18.9%; AOR, 1.39; p < 0.001), 30-day reoperations (3.1% vs. 6.4%; AOR, 1.22; p < 0.001), and length of stay (2 vs. 5) were higher in transferred patients. Transfer had no effect on 30-day readmissions (6% vs. 8.5%; AOR, 1.04; p = 0.063). These results were also observed in high-risk surgery patients and in the late surgery group. The results were further confirmed after robust propensity score weighting was performed. We have demonstrated that delays to surgical intervention affect outcomes and that interhospital transfer of EGS patients for definitive surgical care has a negative impact on mortality, development of postoperative complications, and reoperations in patients undergoing high-risk EGS procedures. These findings may have important implications for regionalization of EGS care. Prognostic/epidemiological, level III."

    "abstract": "Transcatheter correction of superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect (SVASD) is being considered as an alternative to surgery in selected patients. We present the case of a 42-year-old woman with SVASD and partial anomalous venous connection of the right upper pulmonary vein (RUPV), who underwent transcatheter correction with self-expanding aortic stent graft, following feasibility assessment by balloon occlusion. Hemodynamic parameters and angiography demonstrated successful closure of the SVASD without any residual shunt and unobstructed return of RUPV to the left atrium. She developed cardiac tamponade after a few hours despite pericardial drain and underwent emergency exploratory thoracotomy. This revealed leak from a small rent in the ascending aortic wall adjacent to superior vena cava (SVC) caused by barbs of the stent protruding from SVC, without any leak in SVC. This was repaired with suture and further Teflon was placed around the barbs in SVC to prevent further injury. We also discuss the possible reason for this complication, considering our successful previous two cases with the same stents. This case highlights the importance of assessing the relationship between SVC and aorta to decide about the cranial placement of the aortic stent either by computed tomography prior or by contrast aortogram during the procedure. <Learning objective: Transcatheter correction of superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect is becoming an appropriate alternative option for cardiac surgery. There are multiple reports of this technique in the literature - mostly with balloon expandable stents, and few with self-expanding stents placed in superior vena cava (SVC). We present an unanticipated complication of self-expanding aortic stent in this situation and its management, highlighting the need for assessing the relationship between SVC and aorta to decide about the appropriate placement of stent.>."

    "abstract": "Approximately 10% of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have intracranial bleeding (complicated mTBI) and 3.5% eventually require neurosurgical intervention, which is mostly available at centers with a higher level of trauma care designation and often requires interhospital transfer. In 2018, the Brain Injury Guidelines (BIG) were updated in the United States to guide emergency department care and patient disposition for complicated mild to moderate TBI. The aim of this study was to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the updated BIG (uBIG) for predicting the need for interhospital transfer in Canadian patients with complicated mTBI. This study took place at three level I trauma centers. Consecutive medical records of patients with complicated mTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13-15) who were aged ≥ 16 years and presented between September 2016 and December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a penetrating trauma and those who had a documented cerebral tumor or aneurysm were excluded. The primary outcome was a combination of neurosurgical intervention and/or mTBI-related death. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed. A total of 477 patients were included, of whom 8.4% received neurosurgical intervention and 3% died as a result of their mTBI. Forty patients (8%) were classified as uBIG-1, 168 (35%) as uBIG-2, and 269 (56%) as uBIG-3. No patients in uBIG-1 underwent neurosurgical intervention or died as a result of their injury. This translates into a sensitivity for predicting the need for a transfer of 100% (95% CI 93.2%-100%) and a specificity of 9.4% (95% CI 6.8%-12.6%). Using the uBIG could potentially reduce the number of transfers by 6% to 25%. The patients in uBIG-1 could be safely managed at their initial center without the need for transfer to a center with a higher level of neurotrauma care. Although the uBIG could decrease the number of transfers, further refinement of the criteria could improve its specificity."

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing epidemic associated with higher rates of metabolic disease, heart disease and all-cause mortality. Heavier patients may require more advanced resources and specialized equipment. We hypothesize that increasing patient weight will be associated with longer prehospital on-scene times. We reviewed electronic patient care records for patients transported by two urban 9-1-1 emergency medical services (EMS) agencies. We collected age, sex, estimated patient weight, vital signs (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry), provider impression, method of moving patient to ambulance, and on-scene times. We selected patients with time-sensitive diagnoses of stroke, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and trauma and compared on-scene times for patients who weighed above or below 300 pounds. We performed descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for discrete variables. We constructed a generalized linear model to determine the effect of patient weight adjusted for covariates. For a three-year period (May 1, 2018 to April 30, 2021) 48,203 patients were transported with an EMS impression of stroke, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and trauma. 23,654 (49.1%) patients were female, and the median age was 52 (IQR 34-68) years. The median weight was 175.0 (IQR 150.0-205.0) pounds. Patients above a dichotomous weight categorization of 300 pounds experienced a longer median scene time with any time-sensitive diagnosis (12.6 versus 11.9 min p < 0.001), STEMI (16.0 versus 13.1 min, p = 0.014) and blunt trauma (12.6 versus 11.9 min, p < 0.001)). They were more likely to be hypoxic (p < 0.001) and more likely to experience cardiac arrest (p < 0.001). They were less likely to walk to the ambulance (22.1% versus 32.2%, p < 0.001). Patient weight above 300 pounds was associated with significantly longer on-scene time. These patients were more likely to be hypoxic, sustain a cardiac arrest, and less likely to walk to the ambulance."

Volvulus or intussusception of the small bowel with presence of MD as the lead point is the most commonly reported etiology of Meckel's related obstructions. We report an interesting case of a small bowel obstruction caused by the intussusception of an MD within its own lumen. The case involves a 30-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with acute, severe abdominal pain with an abdominal computed tomography (CT) showing a distal high-grade SBO. Decision was made to take the patient to the operating room urgently due to his clinical examination and radiologic imaging, specifically CT scan. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed and subsequently converted to an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed the intussuscepted MD with focal necrosis into the distal small bowel causing an SBO. A segmental small bowel resection with hand sewn primary anastomosis was performed. The case presents an interesting challenge in deciding when to take a patient with an SBO to the operating room versus initial conservative management and what the treatment should be if an MD is encountered. In addition, the case emphasizes the importance of history and physical exam findings in coordination with radiologic imaging in helping to make appropriate decisions in a timely manner for operative vs conservative management of an SBO. It reminds us that, Meckel's diverticulum, although less commonly the cause of a small bowel obstruction in the adult population, needs to be on the differential diagnosis and we need to have a high clinical suspicion for this possibility to ensure appropriate treatment in a timely manner."

It is also known to increase the risk of death and prolong the length of hospital stay in various surgical groups. The main objective of this study is to analyse the anaemia rate on admission to the emergency department and the impact of anaemia on in-hospital mortality. Data from the TraumaRegister DGU® (TR-DGU) between 2015 and 2019 were analysed. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 16 years and most severe Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score ≥ 3. Patients were divided into three anaemia subgroups: no or mild anaemia (NA), moderate anaemia (MA) and severe anaemia (SA). Pre-hospital data, patient characteristics, treatment in the emergency room (ER), outcomes, and differences between trauma centres were analysed. Of 67,595 patients analysed, 94.9% (n = 64,153) exhibited no or mild anaemia (Hb ≥ 9 g/dl), 3.7% (n = 2478) displayed moderate anaemia (Hb 7-8 g/dl) and 1.4% (n = 964) presented with severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dl). Haemoglobin (Hb) values ranged from 3 to 18 g/dl with a mean Hb value of 12.7 g/dl. In surviving patients, anaemia was associated with prolonged length of stay (LOS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed moderate (p < 0.001 OR 1.88 (1.66-2.13)) and severe anaemia (p < 0.001 OR 4.21 (3.46-5.12)) to be an independent predictor for mortality. Further significant predictors are ISS score per point (OR 1.0), age 70-79 (OR 4.8), age > 80 (OR 12.0), severe pre-existing conditions (ASA 3/4) (OR 2.26), severe head injury (AIS 5/6) (OR 4.8), penetrating trauma (OR 1.8), unconsciousness (OR 4.8), shock (OR 2.2) and pre-hospital intubation (OR 1.6).

The first case is a 38-year-old male who fell eight metres from a motorbike jump. He arrived in our emergency department in extremis. The second case is an 81-year-old female driver who presented following a motor vehicle crash. Both patients had massive right haemothorax and haemodynamic instability, so were transferred to the operating theatre for emergency thoracotomies. Both patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the 37 cases of azygos vein injury, including our two, 36 were due to blunt trauma and one from penetrating trauma. Sixteen survived to hospital discharge, producing a 43% mortality rate. Only one of these survivors was managed non-operatively, the remainder underwent emergency thoracotomy and azygos vein ligation. The mortality rate reduced to 31% in those who underwent thoracotomy (n = 29). Presentation was predominantly with shock (83%) and right hemithorax white-out on chest x-ray (81%). Azygos vein injuries are a rare but important cause of thoracic haemorrhage in high-impact blunt trauma. They are often fatal, so management relies on expedient transfer to theatre."

We hypothesized that utilization of an emergency department operating room (EDOR) for resuscitation of patients with abdominal trauma at an urban Level I trauma center would be associated with decreased time to laparotomy and improved outcomes. We included patients 15 years or older with abdominal trauma who underwent emergent laparotomy within 120 minutes of arrival both at our institution and within a National Trauma Data Bank sample between 2007 to 2019 and 2013 to 2016, respectively.

Treatment in the EDOR was associated with decreased time to incision (25.5 minutes vs. 40 minutes; p ≤ 0.001), ICU LOS (1 vs. 3.1 days; p < 0.001), transfusion requirement within 24 hours (3 units vs. 5.8 units packed red blood cells; p = 0.025), hospital LOS (5 days vs. 8.5 days, p = 0.014), and ventilator days (1 day vs. 2 days; p ≤ 0.001). There were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality (22.5% vs. 15.0%; p = 0.14) or outcome-free days (4.9 days vs. 4.5 days, p = 0.55). The use of an EDOR is associated with decreased time to hemorrhage control as evidenced by the decreased time to incision, blood transfusion requirement, ICU LOS, hospital LOS, and ventilator days. These findings support DOR for patients sustaining operative abdominal trauma. Therapeutic/Care Management, Level III."

    "abstract": "To date, there is no evidence concerning the emergency surgical management of severe trauma patients (STP) with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI) presenting a life-threatening intracranial hematoma and a concomitant extra-cranial noncompressible active bleeding. Current guidelines recommend stopping the extra-cranial bleeding first. Nevertheless, the long-term outcome of STP with STBI mainly depends from intracranial lesions. Thus, we propose a combined damage-control surgical strategy aiming to reduce the time spent with intracranial hypertension and to hasten the admission in the intensive care unit. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the benefits of combined cranial and extra-cranial surgery of STP on the long-term outcome. We retrospectively searched through the database of STBI of a level 1 trauma center facility (Sainte-Anne Military Teaching Hospital, Toulon, France) from 2007 until 2021 looking for patients who benefited from combined cranial and extra-cranial surgery in an acute setting. The research yielded 8 patients. The mean age was 35 years old (±14) and the male to female sex ratio was 1.7/1. The trauma mechanism was a fall in 50% of the cases and a traffic accident in 50% of the cases. The median Glasgow coma scale score was 8 (IQR 4) before intubation. The median Injury Severity Score was 41 (IQR 16). Seven patients (88%) presented hypovolemic shock upon admission. Six patients (75%) benefited from damage-control laparotomy among, whom 4 (67%) underwent hemostatic splenectomy. One patient benefited from drainage of tension pneumothorax, and one patient benefited from external fixator of multiple limb fractures. Seven patients (88%) benefited from decompressive craniectomy for acute subdural hematoma (5 patients) or major brain contusion (2 patients). One patient (12%) benefited from craniotomy for epidural hematoma. Three patients presented intraoperative profound hypovolemic shock. Six patients (75%) presented a favorable neurologic outcome with minor complications from extra-cranial surgeries and 2 patients died (25%). Performing combined life-saving cranial and extra-cranial surgery is feasible and safe as long as the trauma teams are trained according to the principles of damage control. It may be beneficial for the neurologic prognostic of STP with STBI requiring cranial and extra-cranial surgery."

    "abstract": "Blunt traumatic tracheobronchial injury is rare, but can be potentially life-threatening. It accounts for only 0.5%-2% of all trauma cases. Patients may present with non-specific signs and symptoms, requiring a high index of suspicion with accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. A 26-year-old female was brought into the emergency department after sustained a blunt trauma to the chest from a high impact motor vehicle accident. She presented with signs of respiratory distress and extensive subcutaneous emphysema from the chest up to the neck. Her airway was secured and chest drain was inserted for right sided pneumothorax. CT of the neck and thorax revealed a collapsed right middle lung lobe with a massive pneumothorax, raising the suspicion of a right middle lobe bronchus injury. Diagnosis was confirmed by bronchoscopy. In view of the difficulty in maintaining her ventilation and persistent pneumothorax with a massive air leak, immediate right thoracotomy via posterolateral approach was performed. The right middle lobar bronchus tear was repaired. There were no intra- or post-operative complications. She made an uneventful recovery. She was asymptomatic at her first month follow-up. A repeated chest X-ray showed expanded lungs. Details of the case including clinical presentation, imaging and management were discussed with an emphasis on the early uses of bronchoscopy in case of suspected blunt traumatic tracheobronchial injury. A review of the current literature of tracheobronchial injury management was presented."

Dissection may cause thrombus formation or vasospasm, leading to the clinical presentation of acute myocardial infarction. Diagnosis can be difficult as traumatic chest pain has several etiologies; therefore, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is necessary in all cases of thoracic trauma [1-3]. Thirty-eight-year old female, with no significant past medical history, presented to a freestanding emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain and right shoulder pain after a blunt trauma water sport accident. Upon selective angiography of left and right coronary artery and left heart catheterization, the patient was found to have an occluded distal left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient underwent aspiration thrombectomy of the proximal LAD artery and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of distal LAD artery, which decreased the stenosis from 100% to less than 10%. The patient was discharged home on hospital day three with follow up in one month.Coronary artery dissection should be considered in blunt thoracic trauma particularly in cases of unexplained chest pain, regardless of the mechanism of injury, age of patient or comorbidities. Patients should be evaluated with an ECG, troponin, and possibly an echocardiogram to rule out this type of injury."

Patients may have delayed presentation when the diaphragmatic defect enlarges and allows abdominal content to herniate into the thoracic cavity. Here, we present the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath at rest for two days duration. He reported having shortness of breath for the last five years, but he attributed it to his smoking. The shortness of breath was associated with cough productive and vague abdominal pain. The patient had an unremarkable relevant medical history. He reported having a motor vehicle accident five years ago that was severe but he did not sustain any significant injuries or fractures. Upon examination, the patient appeared in respiratory distress. Respiratory examination revealed diminished air entry on the left hemithorax and the abdominal examination revealed increased generalized tenderness with increased bowel sounds. The patient underwent a thoracic computed tomography scan, which unexpectedly demonstrated a huge left-sided diaphragmatic defect with bowel loops observed to occupy the left hemithorax completely. The patient was stabilized and shifted to emergency laparotomy during which the hernia content was reduced and the defect was closed with a mesh. The patient reported the resolution of his symptoms after the surgery. Intensive chest physiotherapy exercises were performed. After six months of follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with no active complaints. The diaphragmatic hernia may have delayed presentations after several years of blunt abdominal trauma. The case highlighted the importance of initial imaging studies after blunt trauma may not identify the diaphragmatic defect."

This systematic review and meta-analysis analyze outcomes in patients with thoracic trauma receiving PH-RT and ED-RT. PubMed, JAMA Network, and CINAHL electronic databases were searched to identify studies published on ED-RT or PH-RT between 2000-2020. Patients were grouped by location of procedure and type of thoracic injury (blunt versus penetrating). A total of 49 studies met the criteria for qualitative analysis, and 43 for quantitative analysis. 43 studies evaluated ED-RT and 5 evaluated PH-RT. Time from arrival on scene to PH-RT >5 min was associated with increased neurological complications and time from the initial encounter to PH-RT or ED-RT >10 min was associated with increased mortality. ISS ≥ 25 and absent signs of life were also associated with increased mortality. There was higher mortality in all PH-RT (93.5%) versus all ED-RT (81.8%) (P = 0.02). Among ED-RTs, a significant difference was found in mortality rate between patients with blunt (92.8%) versus penetrating (78.7%) injuries (P < 0.001). When considering only blunt or penetrating injury types, no significant difference in RT mortality rate was found between ED-RT and PH-RT (P = 0.65 and P = 0.95, respectively). ED-RT and PH-RT are potentially life-saving procedures for patients with penetrating thoracic injuries in extremis and with signs of life. The efficacy of this procedure is time sensitive. Moreover, there appears to be a greater mortality risk for patients with thoracic trauma receiving RT in the PH setting compared to the ED setting. More studies are needed to determine the significance of PH-RT mortality."

For the first time in the literature, this report addresses the presentation of iatrogenic perforation of the colon while inserting the peritoneal catheter of VP shunt. Here, we present the case of a 15-year-old boy who is known to have cerebral palsy and congenital hydrocephalus with a VP shunt since birth. He presented to the ER with a history of headache and episodes of vomiting and was diagnosed with VP shunt dysfunction. The patient was taken for an emergency operation for shunt revision and a new shunt was placed. Then the next day he developed signs and symptoms of peritonitis with the distal part of the catheter protruding from the anal cavity, the patient was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, the distal catheter was removed and replaced with external ventricular drainage, intra-operatively it was shown that the catheter was inserted directly into the colon causing bowel perforation, This report raises important questions about the nature of VP shunt bowel perforation and discusses management options."

    "abstract": "In industrialized countries, high energy trauma represents the leading cause of death and disability among people under 35 years of age. The two leading causes of mortality are neurological injuries and bleeding. Clinical evaluation is often unreliable in determining if, when and where injuries should be treated. Traditionally, surgery was the mainstay for assessment of injuries but advances in imaging techniques, particularly in computed tomography (CT), have contributed in progressively changing the classic clinical paradigm for major traumas, better defining the indications for surgery. Actually, the vast majority of traumas are now treated nonoperatively with a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality compared to the past. In this sense, another crucial point is the advent of interventional radiology (IR) in the treatment of vascular injuries after blunt trauma. IR enables the most effective nonoperative treatment of all vascular injuries. Indications for IR depend on the CT evidence of vascular injuries and, therefore, a robust CT protocol and the radiologist's expertise are crucial. Emergency and IR radiologists form an integral part of the trauma team and are crucial for tailored management of traumatic injuries."

We previously designed a bundle of emergency medical services traumatic shock care (\"EMS-TruShoC\") for prehospital providers in resource-limited settings. We assess how EMS-TruShoC changes clinical outcomes of critically injured prehospital patients. This is a quasi-experimental educational implementation of a simplified bundle of care using a pre-post design with a control group. The intervention was delivered to EMS providers in Western Cape, South Africa. Delta shock index (heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure, reported as change from the scene to facility arrival) from the 13 months preceding intervention were compared to the 13 months post-implementation. A difference-in-differences analysis examined the difference in mean shock index change between the groups. Data were collected from 198 providers who treated 770 severe trauma patients. The patient groups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. Over all time-points, both groups had an increase in mean delta shock index (worsening shock), with the largest difference occurring 4-months post-implementation (0.047 change in control arm, 0.004 change in intervention arm; -0.043 difference-in-differences, P = 0.27). In pre-specified subgroup analyses, there was a statistically significant improvement in delta shock index in the intervention arm in patients with penetrating trauma cared for by basic providers immediately post-implementation (-0.372 difference-in-differences, P = 0.02). Overall, there was no significant difference in delta shock index between the EMS-TruShoC intervention versus control groups. However, significant improvement in shock index in one subgroup suggests the intervention may be more likely to benefit penetrating trauma patients and basic providers."

However, a known but very uncommon cause of SBO is malignancies, which are more complicated than those caused by adhesions and hernias, and associated with poorer prognoses; of these, small bowel adenocarcinoma is an even rarer etiology of SBO. The majority of SBO cases that are treated have resolution of symptoms and do not have recurrence/persistence of the condition; however, reports suggest that approximately one-fifth of SBO cases that are treated will result in recurrence/persistence of SBO requiring repeat admission. Here we report the case of an 89-year-old female with a past medical history of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, inferior vena cava filter placement, iron deficiency anemia, diverticular disease, internal hemorrhoids, sick sinus syndrome, emphysema, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism, who presented with diarrhea and intermittent dark stool. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) while in the emergency department initially showed possible ischemic bowel and SBO. After an exploratory laparotomy with small bowel resection and adhesiolysis, pathological analysis of a resected specimen showed infiltrating small bowel adenocarcinoma. Persistence of symptoms necessitated subsequent abdominal imaging, which demonstrated persistent SBO, which was treated with a second exploratory laparotomy with small bowel resection and end ileostomy."

An echocardiogram showed a moderate size pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis was done and a drain was left in place. Of note, the patient reported remarkable resolution of the back pain after the fluid was taken out. The serial echocardiogram post pericardiocentesis showed minimal drainage, hence the drain was taken out, and the patient was observed for clinical monitoring 24 hours post drain removal.

A prospective cohort study was conducted from September 2018 to September 2019. Five hundred patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients received torso-CECT scan only if they had at least one positive ER test. The validity of the single component of the protocol and the global validity of the ER tests to detect torso injuries was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive value, positive (+ LR) and negative (- LR) likelihood ratio. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of torso injuries. One hundred and seventy patients received a torso-CECT scan because of positive ER tests. ER tests showed a global sensitivity for torso injuries of 86.96% (95% CI 80.17-92.08) specificity of 83.98%(95% CI 79.79-87.60), PPV of 67.42% (95% CI 61.83-72.54), NPV of 94.41% (95% CI 91.63-96.30) + LR of 5.43 (95% CI 4.25-6.93), - LR of 0.16 (95% CI 0.10-0.24).

COVID-19 involves a systemic hypercoagulable state and arterial/venous thrombosis which induces unfavorable prognosis. Herein, we present a first case in East Asia where an acute superior mesenteric artery (SMA) occlusion associated with COVID-19 pneumonia was successfully treated by surgical intervention. A 70-year-old man presented to his local physician with a 3-day history of cough and diarrhea. A real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test showed positive for COVID-19, and he was admitted to the source hospital with the diagnosis of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight days later, acute onset of severe abdominal pain appeared with worsening respiratory condition. Contrast CT showed that bilateral lower lobe/middle lobe and lingula ground glass opacification with distribution suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia and right renal infarction. In addition, it demonstrated SMA occlusion with intestinal ischemia suggesting extensive necrosis from the jejunum to the transverse colon. The patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy with implementing institutional COVID-19 precaution guideline. Upon exploration, the intestine from jejunum at 100 cm from Treitz ligament to middle of transverse colon appeared necrotic. Necrotic bowel resection was performed with constructing jejunostomy and transverse colon mucous fistula. We performed second surgery to close the jejunostomy and transverse colon mucous fistula with end-to-end anastomosis on postoperative day 22. The postoperative course was uneventful and he moved to another hospital for rehabilitation to improve activities of daily living (ADLs) on postoperative day 45. As of 6 months after the surgery, his ADLs have completely improved and he has returned to social life without any intravenous nutritional supports. Intensive treatment including surgical procedures allowed the patient with SMA occlusion in COVID-19 pneumonia to return to social life with completely independent ADLs. Although treatment for COVID-19 involves many challenges, including securing medical resources and controlling the spread of infection, when severe abdominal pain occurs in patients with COVID-19, physicians should consider SMA occlusion and treat promptly for life-saving from this deadly combination."

Newborns are the most affected age group, nevertheless, adult malrotation can manifest, but in a much rarer incidence rate. Clinical awareness must be present when faced with a surgical abdomen in an adolescent patient because this pathology can have several misleading signs and symptoms which may eclipse the true preoperative diagnosis and masquerade as another, and this could result in implementing a different therapeutic approach. Swift clinical informed judgments must be made and acted upon to limit the morbidity and mortality resultant from this pathology. We present the case of a 15-year-old female, who was brought to our Emergency Department (ED) with a 5-day-history of biliary emesis which evolved into obstipation with continuous and excruciating abdominal pain. Computed Tomography (CT) scan indicated gastric and duodenal dilation in addition to a \"Whirlpool sign\". Exploratory laparotomy was done, and a Ladd's procedure was performed. We treated our patient by performing Ladd's procedure and adhesiolysis. Diagnosis is conventionally established pre-/intraoperatively based on radiological imaging and clinical suspicion. Therapeutic methods for this pathology are primarily surgical in nature. Midgut Malrotation is a rare entity, thus, it is crucial to further study this type of clinical presentation and keep it in mind to be able to make an accurate diagnosis to reach the optimal outcome for patients who present with acute surgical abdomen."

    "abstract": "Occam's razor instructs physicians to assume one single cause for multiple symptoms, whereas Hickam's dictum encourages them to suspect multiple concurrent pathologies. Although the general practice is to follow Occam's razor, occasionally Hickam's dictum reigns supreme. Here we present one such case, where the concurrent presence of two life-threatening pathologies posed clinical challenges in diagnosis and management. Although cardiac tamponade and pulmonary embolism (PE) are known complications of malignancy, their concomitant existence is rare. Here we report a patient who presented with shortness of breath found to have both cardiac tamponade and submassive PE. Although the cardiac tamponade was initially diagnosed in the Emergency Department by bedside ultrasound and treated with pericardiocentesis, only a few hours later, when she deteriorated, the submassive PE was diagnosed, which was treated with heparin infusion and subsequently transitioned to a newer oral anticoagulant. The patient was later diagnosed as having primary breast cancer and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? This raised unique diagnostic challenges, as both cardiac tamponade and PE present with obstructive shock. The increased right heart pressure from the PE could have paradoxically protected the patient from the tamponade effects of the pericardial effusion. Furthermore, the presence of cardiac tamponade may also mask the typical echocardiographic features of PE. The concurrent presence of two pathologies raised challenges and dilemmas in management. This case shows that physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion of two pathologies when the patient deteriorates after the first pathology has been appropriately treated."

Hospital and late outcomes were assessed in patients with age >80 years. Eighteen patients (15%) were octogenarians with seven males (39%) and median age of 82 years (range, 80-89). Hypertension was present in six patients (33%). None had diabetes mellitus, Marfan, or bicuspid aortic valve. Dissection was intramural hematoma in six (33%) and DeBakey type I in 15 patients (83%). Cardiac tamponade with shock was present in seven patients (39%). Ascending aortic grafting was performed in 17 patients, and additional hemiarch replacement in one patient. The hospital mortality rate was 17% (3/18). Fourteen patients (82%) were alive and well at discharge. Emergency surgery for AAAD using a standard conservative approach showed an improved outcome in octogenarians. The majority of patients could return home with an acceptable living."

    "abstract": "A 67-year-old man presented to the emergency department for two weeks of progressive shortness of breath with orthopnea and new-onset back pain. On admission, vital signs were normal, and physical exam was remarkable for jugular vein distention with the rest of the cardiovascular exam in normal limits. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large circumferential pericardial effusion with M-mode analysis revealed diastolic collapse of the right ventricle (RV) and > 40% tricuspid inflow respiratory variation in Doppler. Emergency pericardiocentesis yielded 800 cm3 of yellow-colored fluid. Subsequently, the patient underwent lymph node biopsy showing tumor cells consistent with squamous cell carcinoma of unknown origin. This case highlights the use of bedside echocardiogram and M-mode imaging for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade."

    "abstract": "The use of the extremity tourniquet in military environments has reduced preventable deaths due to exsanguinating hemorrhage, leading to increased use in civilian settings. However, the outcomes of contemporary prehospital tourniquet use in civilian settings are not well-described nationally. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes following prehospital tourniquet use by emergency medical services (EMS) in the United States. All trauma activations reported to the National EMS Information System 2019 (NEMSIS) were included. Patients who had ≥1 tourniquet applied were identified. Descriptive analyses were used to compare characteristics between tourniquet and no-tourniquet cohorts. Coarsened exact matching was performed to generate a k2k match (on age, sex, lowest-systolic blood pressure, initial patient acuity, provider's initial impression, injury mechanism, and presence of upper/lower extremity injuries) and used to compare outcomes. Trauma patients who may have potentially benefited from tourniquet application (extremity injury, shock index ≥1 and no documented tourniquet application) were identified. A total of 7,161 tourniquets were applied among 4,571,379 trauma activations (1.6/1000 activations). Patients in the tourniquet cohort were younger (40 ± 18 vs 52 ± 26 mean ± SD years), more hypotensive (16.1% vs. 2.5%) and had higher initial acuity (65.0% critical/emergent vs. 20.6%) [p < 0.01 for all]. A total of 7,074 patients in the tourniquet cohort were matched with 7,074 patients in the non-tourniquet cohort. Post-match analysis revealed that the patients in tourniquet cohort had a higher final acuity (80.8% vs. 75.0%, p < 0.01), lower scene-time (15.4 ± 13.6 vs. 17.0 ± 14.2 mean ± SD minutes, p < 0.01), and higher survival-to-hospital (83.6% vs. 75.1%, p < 0.01). A total of 141,471 trauma patients who may have potentially benefited from tourniquet application were identified. Prehospital tourniquet use by EMS in the United States is associated with lower scene-time and improved survivability to hospital. Results indicate that patients might benefit from wider tourniquet use in the civilian prehospital setting."

    "abstract": "A uterine/ovarian artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of pelvic surgical interventions such as oocyte retrieval. This complication can be life-threatening due to the risk of rupture and blood extravasation. We report the case of a 30-year-old, nulliparous, married woman with a rare uterine/ovarian artery pseudoaneurysm due to in vitro fertilization. The patient has a history of sickle cell disease and primary infertility with multiple failed ovulation induction. She presented to the emergency department (ED) with hypotension following ovum retrieval for in vitro fertilization. Upon examination, we noted that the patient had tense ascites. A focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) in the ED revealed internal bleeding. The diagnosis of a uterine artery pseudoaneurysm was established. She underwent an exploratory laparotomy to control bleeding due to her instability. Computed tomography and FAST scans help make an accurate diagnosis, and this case highlights that early intervention by embolization is essential to stabilize the patient and improve patient outcomes."

A 22-year-old motorcyclist presented to the emergency department following a collision with an automobile. Clinical examination demonstrated a bulging mass at the lower abdomen, resulting from impact with the motorcycle handlebar. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen revealed a disruption of both rectus abdominis muscle and linea alba at the lower abdomen with loops of small bowels and mesentery herniating through the defect, associated with multiple air pockets and pneumoperitoneum. Exploratory laparotomy showed TAWH containing loops of small bowel and mesentery in addition to mesenteric tears. Small bowel resection with primary anastomosis and repair of the anterior abdominal wall defect using interrupted polypropylene sutures was performed.

    "abstract": "A 2-month-old puppy was brought to a veterinary hospital with diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia. The test for canine parvovirus was positive, and she was hospitalized for supportive care. Her gastrointestinal symptoms initially improved; however, vomiting and lethargy developed again in the second week of hospitalization. Abdominal ultrasonography results were suspicious of a duodenal perforation. Cytology of the abdominal effusion confirmed septic peritonitis; therefore, emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. The surgery was successful, and the puppy recovered fully. When symptoms recur or deteriorate in patients with parvoviral infection, surgically curable complications may be disregarded if supportive therapy is continued without additional investigative examinations. This report highlights the usefulness of abdominal ultrasound in conjunction with fluid cytology to identify subsequent complications when the clinical signs of parvovirus deteriorate. Key clinical message: This case report demonstrates duodenal perforation as a complication of parvoviral infection. Abdominal ultrasonography and peritoneal fluid cytology can be crucial for the early recognition of intestinal complications requiring immediate successful perioperative treatment. Perforation duodénale chez un chiot infecté par le parvovirus canin. Un chiot de 2 mois a été amené dans un hôpital vétérinaire avec de la diarrhée, des vomissements et de l’anorexie. Le test de dépistage du parvovirus canin était positif et l’animal a été hospitalisé pour des soins de soutien. Ses symptômes gastro-intestinaux se sont initialement améliorés; cependant, des vomissements et une léthargie se sont à nouveau développés au cours de la deuxième semaine d’hospitalisation. Les résultats de l’échographie abdominale étaient suspects d’une perforation duodénale. La cytologie de l’épanchement abdominal a confirmé une péritonite septique; par conséquent, une laparotomie exploratrice d’urgence a été réalisée. L’opération a été un succès et le chiot s’est complètement rétabli. Lorsque les symptômes réapparaissent ou s’aggravent chez les patients atteints d’une infection parvovirale, les complications soignables chirurgicalement peuvent être ignorées si le traitement de soutien est poursuivi sans examens d’investigation supplémentaires.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic changed the face of health care worldwide. While the impacts from this catastrophe are still being measured, it is important to understand how this pandemic impacted existing health care systems. As such, the objective of this study was to quantify its effects on trauma volume at an urban Level 1 trauma center in one of the earliest and most significantly affected US cities. A retrospective chart review of consecutive trauma patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020 was completed. The total trauma volume in the years prior to the pandemic (2017-2019) was compared to the volume in 2020. These data were then further stratified to compare quarterly volume across all 4 years. A total of 4138 trauma patients were treated in the emergency room throughout 2020 with 4124 seen during 2019, 3774 during 2018, and 3505 during 2017 in the pre-COVID-19 time period. No significant difference in the volume of minor trauma or trauma transfers was observed (P < .05). However, there was a significant increase in the number of major traumas in 2020 as compared to prior years (38.5% vs 35.6%, P < .01) and in the volume of penetrating trauma (29.1% vs 24.0%, P < .01). During the COVID-19 outbreak, trauma remained a significant health care concern. This study found an increase in volume of penetrating trauma, specifically gunshot wounds throughout 2020. It remains important to continue to devote resources to trauma patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."

A nationwide retrospective cohort analysis of the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Programs Participant Use Profile 2016-2018. Adult patients who suffered blunt, penetrating, or other injuries secondary to falls/firearms/motor vehicle collision/other mechanisms of injury and presented to a trauma center pulseless, with or without signs of life after injury. Rates of thoracotomy, time to thoracotomy, transfer to operating room, emergency department disposition, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, complications, mortality, and hospital disposition. Univariate analyses and adjusted multivariable regression were performed to account for confounders with significance defined as P < .05. A total of 6,453 patients were analyzed. Emergency department thoracotomy and mortality were significantly higher in minorities and uninsured patients, even after risk adjustment. There were no differences in timing among race groups to emergency department thoracotomy. White/Caucasian patients experienced the highest rate of emergency department initial disposition to the intensive care unit (10.3%, P < .0001) and lowest mortality rate (89.2%, P < .0001). Surgeon bias was not seen in the practice of emergency department thoracotomy for patients arriving pulseless. However, poorer outcomes were associated with minorities and lower socioeconomic status patients. Thoracotomy rates were higher in minorities and lower socioeconomic status patients due to more penetrating trauma."

In this report, a case with total transection of common hepatic duct and treatment approach was presented. In unstable patients, damage control surgery can be applied. A 32-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency department after a beating that includes multiple blunt trauma. Radiological screening showed cranial, nasal, lumbar vertebral, and costal bone fractures, decreased blood flow to the right kidney and free perihepatic and perisplenic fluid. Neurosurgeons operated this patient at the day of admission and no plan for laparotomy was made for this patient at that time. Second day postoperatively patient was transferred to the department of surgery and exploratory laparotomy has been made. Common hepatic duct was fully transected and because of the patient's hemodynamic instability, an external fistula has been made. The patient discharged 10th day postoperatively. The patient was operated after follow-up and a Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy has been made. Extrahepatic bile duct injuries are rare and high suspicion is important in complex multitrauma patients. Extent of the injury is unique for every patient and technical aspect of repair can be challenging."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Gastric necrosis and perforation are rare life-threatening conditions in preterm neonates, which require urgent diagnosis and surgical intervention. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 4-day-old patient with neonatal gastric necrosis. The patient presented with sudden acute abdominal distension, respiratory distress, and metabolic acidosis. The abdomen was markedly distended, tender, and tympanic with collateral circulation. An X-ray of the abdomen showed a huge pneumoperitoneum. An urgent exploratory laparotomy revealed 2 wide horizontal perforations and necrosis of the fundus and gastric body. Subtotal gastrectomy with esogastric anastomosis was done. Postoperatively, the patient was administered total parenteral nutrition and triple antibiotics and improved gradually. He passed stool and the abdomen was soft, lax, and non-distended and the wound healed. An upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) contrast study 1 week after the operation showed no leakage or stricture. The patient was discharged 2 months postoperatively with a bodyweight of 2 kg and was followed in the Outpatient Department (OPD). The patient survived after 80% gastric resection for necrosis of the stomach, which was a unique outcome for this major surgery. CONCLUSIONS Gastric perforation is a rare life-threatening condition in preterm neonates, usually managed by direct closure in layers. Exceptionally, partial gastrectomy is needed, which is a major operation, with a high mortality rate and poor outcome. We present a case of a preterm neonate who survived after 80% gastric resection for stomach necrosis."

We report a rare and fatal case of spontaneous necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) of the anterior abdominal wall caused by Finegoldia magna in a chronic diabetic patient. The initial presentation and radiological features suggested a pelvic abscess. Other acute abdomen differentials were also considered, and the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy where a necrotic anterior abdominal wall with copious purulent secretions was noted. The organism Finegoldia magna was identified from the necrotic tissue sample with other cultures coming back negative. The risk posed by NSTIs is very high, and hence though the incidence is low, clinicians should be aware of the potential dangers of this disease to avoid delays in initiating appropriate treatment."

We report a case of metastatic urachal adenocarcinoma presenting as bowel obstruction. A 54-year-old male patient with a history of alcohol abuse presented to the emergency with acute-onset, diffuse, cramping abdominal pain, worst in the epigastrium and lasting one day. Abdominal examination revealed moderate guarding and generalized tenderness with hypoactive bowel sounds. Imaging confirmed an evolving small bowel obstruction and a urachal remnant with a superimposed mass lesion. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and a high-grade small bowel obstruction due to the mass was identified. An intraoperative frozen section identified adenocarcinoma. A biopsy of the urachal mass confirmed urachal adenocarcinoma. The final diagnosis was moderately differentiated urachal adenocarcinoma. The tumor was deemed unresectable due to the involvement of multiple loops of the small bowel and the mesentery of the small and large bowels. Systemic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (modified FOLFOX-6) was initiated. Our patient did not report any prior urinary symptoms or recurrent abdominal pain, which are the common symptoms that urachal adenocarcinoma presents with. Bowel obstruction is a rare presentation of urachal adenocarcinoma since the spread of the disease to the viscera occurs much later in the course.

Some of these patients require laparotomy, and rapid decision-making and life-saving surgery are essential. Damage control (DC) surgery is useful for treating children in critical situations. We performed this technique to treat an 8-year-old boy with grade IV blunt hepatic injury and multiple organ damage. This is the first report of the use of the ABTHERA Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System (KCI, now part of 3 M Company, San Antonio, TX, USA) for DC surgery to rescue a patient without neurological sequelae. An 8-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department of our hospital after being run over by a motor vehicle. He had grade IV blunt hepatic injury, thyroid injury, and bilateral hemopneumothorax. Although he was hemodynamically stable, the patient's altered level of consciousness, the presence of a sign of peritoneal irritation, and suspicion of intestinal injury led us to perform exploratory laparotomy. As part of a DC strategy, we performed gauze packing to control hemorrhage from the liver and covered the abdomen with an ABTHERA Open Abdomen Negative Pressure Therapy System to improve the patient's general condition. Eighteen days after admission, the patient was diagnosed with a biliary fistula, which improved with percutaneous and external drainage. He had no neurological sequelae and was discharged 102 days after injury. The DC strategy was effective in children with severe blunt hepatic injury. We opted to perform DC surgery because children have less hemodynamic reserve than adults, and we believe that using this strategy before the appearance of trauma triad of death could save lives and improve outcomes. During conservative management, it is important to adopt a multistage, flexible approach to achieve a good outcome."

After a chest and abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, the patient underwent emergency suturing of the left hemidiaphragm. On postoperative day (POD) 4, a CT scan performed due to the sudden onset of dyspnea revealed rupture of the right hemidiaphragm, which was not detected on the preoperative CT scan. On POD 9, the right hemidiaphragm was repaired with mesh during a right thoracotomy. The patient recovered 14 days after surgery. However, the postoperative course was complicated by an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection that significantly delayed her discharge from the hospital. Conclusions: Difficulties in preoperative diagnosis and treatment, together with the lack of data in the literature, make this type of trauma a challenge for all acute care and general surgeons."

However, the ability to identify patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the prehospital setting is limited and prehospital ETI carries a high complication rate. We investigated the prevalence of significant TBI among patients intubated in the field for that reason. Data were retrospectively collected from emergency medical services and hospital records of trauma patients for whom prehospital ETI was attempted and who were transferred to Rambam Health Care Campus, Israel. The indication for ETI was extracted. The primary outcome was significant TBI (clinical or radiographic) among patients intubated due to suspected severe head trauma. In 57.3% (379/662) of the trauma patients, ETI was attempted due to impaired consciousness. 349 patients were included in the final analysis: 82.8% were male, the median age was 34 years (IQR 23.0-57.3), and 95.7% suffered blunt trauma. 253 patients (72.5%) had significant TBI. In a multivariable analysis, Glasgow Coma Scale>8 and alcohol intoxication were associated with a lower risk of TBI with OR of 0.26 (95% CI 0.13-0.51, p < 0.001) and 0.16 (95% CI 0.06-0.46, p < 0.001), respectively. Altered mental status in the setting of trauma is a major reason for prehospital ETI. Although most of these patients had TBI, one in four of them did not suffer a significant TBI. Patients with a higher field GCS and those suffering from intoxication have a higher risk of misdiagnosis. Future studies should explore better tools for prehospital assessment of TBI and ways to better define and characterize patients who may benefit from early ETI."

A 33-year-old woman was referred to our emergency department with swelling on her left upper arm after playing volleyball. Paresis or paralysis was not observed. The pulse of the left brachial artery was palpable, but relatively weak. An ultrasound examination and a computed tomography, both, revealed a pseudoaneurysm on the posterior wall of the left brachial artery in the antecubital fossa. A massive hematoma was also observed beneath the artery. The examination ruled out any concomitant injuries such as fracture and dislocation of the joints. An emergency surgery was performed. A hockey stick skin incision was made from the distal brachium to the antecubital fossa. The left brachial artery was detected in the hematoma. A 15 mm-long laceration was observed on the posterior wall of the artery. The condition of the vessel wall around laceration was poor. Therefore, we resected the injured lesions. The defect was so long that the lesion was interposed by a reversed saphenous vein graft. Heparin was administered one day after the surgery, which was later changed to apixaban on the sixth day after the surgery. Apixaban was discontinued after a month post-surgery.

Our endeavor is to find whether e-FAST can be substituted for NCCT for assessing injuries accurately in a stable blunt trauma patient. Prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care trauma center during the period of November 2017 to 2019. Of the 197 patients presenting to the trauma surgeon in the trauma center, 110 were included in the study after satisfying the inclusion criteria. Eighty-seven patients being hemodynamically unstable were excluded from the study. There was no statistical significance in the comparative data between the groups and all with \"p\" values more than 0.05. This accepts the null hypothesis and establishes the fact that there is no difference between NCCT chest which is the gold standard for chest blunt trauma and e-FAST. We conclude that e-FAST is a better adjunct to the diagnosis and management of blunt trauma chest patients. Devadoss H, Sharma P, Nair VV, Rehsi SS, Roy N, Rao PP.

    "abstract": "The management of out-of-hospital traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) for professional rescuers entails Advanced Life Support (ALS) with specific actions to treat the potential reversible causes of the arrest: hypovolemia, hypoxemia, tension pneumothorax (TPx), and tamponade. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of specific rescue measures on short-term outcomes in the context of resuscitating patients with a TCA. This retrospective study concerns all TCA patients treated in two emergency medical units, which are part of the Northern French Alps Emergency Network (RENAU), from January 2004 through December 2017. Utstein variables and specific rescue measures in TCA were compiled: fluid expansion, pelvic stabilization, tourniquet application, bilateral thoracostomy, and thoracotomy procedures. The primary endpoint was survival rate at Day 30 with good neurological status (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] score CPC 1 and CPC 2). In total, 287 resuscitation attempts in TCA were included and 279 specific interventions were identified: 262 fluid expansions, 41 pelvic stabilizations, five tourniquets, and 175 bilateral thoracostomies (including 44 with TPx). Among the standard resuscitation measures to treat the reversible causes of cardiac arrest, this study found that bilateral thoracostomy and tourniquet application on a limb hemorrhage improve survival in TCA. A larger sample for pelvic stabilization is needed."

    "abstract": "Improving telephone triage for patients with chest pain has been identified as a national research priority. However, there is a lack of strong evidence to define the life-threatening conditions (LTCs) that telephone triage ought to identify. Therefore, we aimed to build consensus for the LTCs associated with chest pain that ought to be identified during telephone triage for emergency calls. We conducted a Delphi study in three rounds. Twenty experts in pre-hospital care and emergency medicine experience from the UK were invited to participate. In round I, experts were asked to list all LTCs that would require priority 1, 2, and 4 ambulance responses. Round II was a ranking evaluation, and round III was a consensus round. Consensus level was predefined at > = 70%. A total of 15 participants responded to round one and 10 to rounds two and three. Of 185 conditions initially identified by the experts, 26 reached consensus in the final round. Ten conditions met consensus for requiring priority 1 response: oesophageal perforation/rupture; ST elevation myocardial infarction; non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with clinical compromise (defined, also by consensus, as oxygen saturation < 90%, heart rate < 40/min or systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg); acute heart failure; cardiac tamponade; life-threatening asthma; cardiac arrest; tension pneumothorax and massive pulmonary embolism. An additional six conditions met consensus for priority 2 response, and three for priority 4 response. Using expert consensus, we have defined the LTCs that may present with chest pain, which ought to receive a high-priority ambulance response. This list of conditions can now form a composite primary outcome for future studies to derive and validate clinical prediction models that will optimise telephone triage for patients with a primary complaint of chest pain."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous coronary artery rupture (SCAR) is an extremely rare and highly lethal disease. A 74-year-old man who had undergone respiratory surgery (robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) presented with exertional dyspnoea since postoperative day (POD) 6. Echocardiography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed diffuse pericardial effusion, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed widespread concave ST-segment elevation. The diagnosis of acute pericarditis was made based on the absence of significant elevation of cardiac enzymes and the presence of elevated C-reactive peptide levels. The patient was started on anti-inflammatory medication, including steroids; however, on POD 11, the patient developed a sudden cardiopulmonary arrest due to cardiac tamponade. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and an emergency coronary angiography showed contrast extravasation from the left anterior descending artery to the epicardium. He was diagnosed with SCAR and underwent transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and pericardial drainage. In this case, SCAR occurred during the course of acute pericarditis. We speculated that the cause of SCAR was more affected with pericarditis than injury by the respiratory surgery. The clinical course of acute pericarditis generally has a good prognosis, but the rare occurrence of fatal complications should be considered, suggesting the need for careful follow-up. In addition, TAE was a less invasive and feasible treatment for SCAR."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the complications of penetrating heart trauma among patients referred to Shahid Madani Hospital. In this retrospective descriptive study, the data of penetrating cardiac trauma patients referred to Shahid Madani hospital, Karaj, Tehran, from 2016-2019, were investigated. Information, including age, sex, cause of trauma, traumatized area and complications, was extracted and recorded in a data collection form. The data were evaluated statistically using SPSS v18. A total of 44 patients were included in the study, where the mean age of the patients was 25 years. 73.3% of these patients were men and 26.7% were women. Knife stab wounds were the most prevalent cause of the trauma, present in 93.3% of patients. 73.3% of the patients had cardiac tamponade and 20% had a pneumothorax. The right ventricle was the most common site of the injury in 46.7% of the patients. A mortality rate of 3.4% was reported in this study. The results of this study showed that the highest penetrating heart rate trauma occurred among young people, and the most common cause of the trauma was a knife stab. The most common area of the injury was the right ventricular, and cardiac tamponade was the most common complication."

    "abstract": "Chest X-rays (CXRs) are often requested for patients who present to emergency with abdominal pain, but its benefit to patient management remains unclear. Several guidelines have been developed to ensure that imaging investigations have the highest diagnostic impact. This study aims to compare referral guidelines to establish their recommendations and circumstances for recommendations regarding CXRs for patients with abdominal pain. A systematic search of the literature was performed using Medline (via OVID), PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar. Referral guidelines were included if they provided recommendations for imaging of abdominal pain, were based on published evidence, and were broadly utilised. Data related to their recommendations for CXR for abdominal pain was recorded and analysed. Three guidelines supported the use of CXRs in the case of suspected perforation. Two guidelines included CXR for patients presenting with blunt abdominal trauma and severe abdominal pain requiring admission. One of the guidelines included use of CXRs for patients presenting with suspected small bowel obstruction, cholecystitis, and penetrating trauma. Two guidelines recorded no circumstances where the use of CXRs were recommended. Published evidence-based guidelines allow for the use of CXRs for patients presenting with abdominal pain in very limited circumstances."

    "abstract": "The maternal death rate remains unacceptably high worldwide, predominantly in areas of poor access to quality health services. According to the WHO, in 2017, 810 women died from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Causes of maternal death are plenty, including previous morbidity and unexpected causes. Among the latter are infectious disease-related deaths. Herein, we describe a case of a 29-year-old woman at 37 weeks' gestation who presented with right upper quadrant pain, which was initially considered to be pregnancy-related. However, she collapsed shortly after the hospital admission. The physical examination revealed severe hypovolemic shock due to a large amount of intraperitoneal free fluid. The patient was immediately rushed into an emergency cesarean section followed by exploratory laparotomy, which demonstrated a large intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The patient and her fetus died in the operating room. An autopsy revealed acute gangrenous cholecystitis along with abundant rod-shaped bacteria within the mucosa and vessels of the gallbladder, gas gangrene and rupture of the spleen, and signs of shock. Clostridium perfringens (CP) was isolated in the culture of a splenic sample. Although CP is a well-known and dreadful infectious etiological agent, catastrophic cases still happen. The acquaintance of this infection by the caregivers is crucial for the early diagnosis and treatment. This is a quite unique way to provide a dismal chance of survival in sepsis cases by this agent."

We retrospectively analysed 187 medical records of patients with trauma who presented to the emergency department of a level II trauma centre in East Java, Indonesia, between August and December 2018. We analysed the data, which included demographic characteristics, Glasgow Coma Scale score, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and injury scores of six parts of the body. Spearman's rank correlation was used to determine the correlation among variables. A total of 181 medical records of patients with trauma were reviewed in this study. Two-third of the patients were male (n = 113, 62.4%). Approximately half of the trauma injuries were caused by road traffic accidents (n = 89, 49.2%); the majority of these injuries resulted from blunt trauma (n = 167, 92.3%). The TRISSes of most of the patients (n = 178, 98.3%) with a good prognosis ranged from 77.1% to 99.7%.

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, TB is a global public health problem and it remains in 2020 the deadliest infectious disease in the world, ahead of Covid19 (Global Tuberculosis Report 2020, 2020). Morocco is an endemic area with more than 30,000 new cases of all forms of tuberculosis each year (Plan stratégique national 2018-2021 de lutte antituberculeuse, 2018). UGTB is the second most frequent localization after lymph node involvement and is responsible for 30 to 40% of all extrapulmonary cases. We hereby present the uncommon case of a 27-year-old virgin woman with unremarkable medical and surgical histories, who presented at the emergency department for left-sided pelvic pain of acute installation. An exploratory laparotomy using a Pfannenstiel incision, demonstrated a peritoneal effusion of low abundance with a twisted left ovary and a huge pyosalpinx. Detorsion was then carefully performed, with improvement in color of the ovary and decrease in edema within 10 min. Histopathological study of the Fallopian tube biopsy revealed granulomatous abscessificated salpingitis with genital tuberculosis. Thus, the patient received her anti-tuberculosis treatment with a course of 6 months of 2HRZE/4HR. In view of the resurgence of cases of tuberculosis of all forms, the importance of prevention and screening should not be underestimated, especially in endemic areas. In fact, only BCG at birth and the correct treatment of any primary tuberculosis infection, whatever its location, will make it possible to reduce the consequences of this affection and avoid the tragedy of the home without children."

Tuberculosis remains a major cause of pericardial effusion in endemic areas. A 16-year-old adolescent with no significant past history was admitted to the medical unit of the Buea Regional hospital in the South West region of Cameroon for heart failure after presenting with abdominal distension, shortness of breath and fever of two weeks duration. Echocardiographic study during admission revealed a large pericardial effusion (27mm in thickness) with echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic guided pericardiocentesis was performed through a sub-xiphoid route and about 500 cc of heavily stained blood fluid that was not coagulating was drained. Pericardial fluid analysis for acid fast bacilli was negative. There was no evidence of malignancy. A strong suspicion of tuberculosis was made and he was started on anti-tuberculosis medications for presumptive hemorrhagic tuberculous pericarditis. Patient was asymptomatic during follow up and repeat echocardiographic examinations showed no re-accumulation of pericardial fluid. Tuberculosis should be considered as the etiology of pericardial effusion in endemic areas although the identification of mycobacterium is challenging in these settings."

    "abstract": "Several case reports suggest that penetrating thoracic cage fractures are an important cause for hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade following blunt trauma. However, the prevalence of this mechanism of injury is not fully known, and considering this association may provide a better understanding of the utility of cardiac component of the FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma). To determine the association of thoracic cage fractures and pericardial effusion in patients with blunt trauma. We performed a retrospective, multicenter cohort study using the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database (2015-2017) of adults ≥18 years of age whose mechanism of injury was either a fall or motor vehicle accident. Thoracic cage fractures were defined as any rib or sternum fracture. The primary outcome was the presence of pericardial effusion. Confounding variables were accounted for using multivariable logistic regression. We included 1,673,704 patients in the study; 226,896 (14%) patients had at least one thoracic cage fracture. A pericardial effusion was present in 4923 (0.3%) patients. When a thoracic cage fracture was present, the odds of having a pericardial effusion was significantly higher (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 6.5 [95% CI: 6.1-7.0]). Patients with left and right-sided rib fractures had similar odds of a pericardial effusion (aOR 1.2 [95% CI 1.04-1.4]). Sternal fractures carried the highest odds of having a pericardial effusion (aOR 11.1 [9.9-12.3]). Thoracic cage fractures secondary to blunt trauma represent a significant independent risk factor for the development of a pericardial effusion. Our findings lend support for the mechanism of bony injuries causing penetrating cardiac trauma. Given these findings, and the fact that many thoracic cage fractures are detected after the initial evaluation, we support maintaining the cardiac view in the FAST examination for all blunt trauma patients."

We retrospectively investigated the significance of medical intervention with pericardiocentesis and/or pericardiotomy for non-traumatic hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade. From January 2013 to April 2021, we retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of all patients with cardiac arrest in a prehospital setting or emergency room due to cardiac tamponade confirmed by an ultrasound examination with or without an invasive procedure (pericardiocentesis and/or pericardiotomy) and computed tomography findings, including those obtained at autopsy imaging. The subjects were divided into two groups: the Intervention (+) group, which included subjects who underwent pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy, and the Intervention (-) group, which included subjects who did not undergo pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy. Variables were then compared between the two groups. There were 68 patients with non-traumatic cardiac tamponade. All three survival cases had witnessed collapse, and the initial rhythm was pulseless electrical activity (PEA).There were no statistically significant differences in the sex, age, means of transportation, bystander chest compression, electric shock, or adrenalineor FDP levels between the two groups.However, the number with witnessed collapse, PEA, rupture of the heart;the ratio of obtaining return of spontaneous circulation; and the survival ratio were significantly greater in the Intervention (+) group than in the Intervention (-) group. Based on the results of preliminary study, we hypothesized that invasive medical intervention for patients with cardiac arrest induced by non-traumatic hemorrhagic cardiac tamponade might be useful for obtaining return of spontaneous circulation and a survival outcome, especially for patients with witnessed collapse with PEA as the initial rhythm."

The treatment strategy for MVT is clinically challenging due to its insidious onset and rapid development, especially when accompanied by kidney transplantation. Here we present a rare case of acute MVT developed 3 years after renal transplantation. A 49-year-old patient was admitted with acute abdominal pain and diagnosed as MVT with intestinal necrosis. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed to remove the infarcted segment of the bowel. Immediate systemic anticoagulation was also initiated. During the treatment, the patient experienced bleeding, anastomotic leakage, and sepsis. However, after aggressive treatment was administered, all thrombi were completely resolved, and the patient recovered with his renal graft function unimpaired. The present case suggests that accurate diagnosis and timely surgical treatment are important to improve the survival rate of MVT patients. Bleeding with anastomotic fistula needs to be treated with caution because of grafts. Also, previously published cases of mesenteric thrombosis after renal transplantation were reviewed."

A 48-year-old man with a history of protein S deficiency presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and a productive cough. CT of the chest showed pulmonary emboli, moderate pericardial effusion, and a large thrombus of the superior vena cava, brachiocephalic vein, and subclavian veins. He developed echocardiographic evidence of cardiac tamponade so he underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of milky-appearing fluid. Analysis of the fluid showed elevated triglycerides consistent with chylopericardium. The pericardial effusion reaccumulated, likely secondary to lymphatic duct obstruction due to his subclavian vein thrombus. Catheter-assisted thrombolysis was performed with resolution of the patient's effusion and symptoms. Chylopericardium is a rare but important complication of subclavian vein thrombosis. Management is typically with surgical intervention, although our case represents successful treatment with catheter-assisted thrombolysis."

The hypothesis was that performance would not differ significantly in each of these subgroups when compared with the overall test dataset. A retrospective case-control study was undertaken. Community radiology clinics and hospitals in Australia and the USA. A test dataset of 2557 chest radiography studies was ground-truthed by three subspecialty thoracic radiologists for the presence of simple or tension pneumothorax as well as each subgroup other than positioning. Radiograph positioning was derived from radiographer annotations on the images. DCNN performance for detecting simple and tension pneumothorax was evaluated over the entire test set, as well as within each subgroup, using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A difference in AUC of more than 0.05 was considered clinically significant. When compared with the overall test set, performance of the DCNN for detecting simple and tension pneumothorax was statistically non-inferior in all subgroups. The DCNN had an AUC of 0.981 (0.976-0.986) for detecting simple pneumothorax and 0.997 (0.995-0.999) for detecting tension pneumothorax. Hidden stratification has significant implications for potential failures of deep learning when applied in clinical practice. This study demonstrated that a comprehensively trained DCNN can be resilient to hidden stratification in several clinically meaningful subgroups in detecting pneumothorax."

    "abstract": "Primary lung cancer usually presents in older adults with a smoking history. However, there is an estimated incidence of 15-20% among men who have never smoked. The diagnosis of lung malignancy can often be incidental. Moreover, cardiac tamponade can be an initial presentation of malignancy, especially lung cancer, as these are the most common tumors that involve the pericardium. Here, we present a 54-year-old male with no known medical history presented with dyspnea on exertion. He was found to have a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology on a bedside echocardiogram. He was also found to have bilateral deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism on admission. The patient underwent an emergent pericardiocentesis due to hemodynamic compromise, and pericardial fluid cytology suggested adenocarcinoma with lung primary. Subsequently, gene testing revealed anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient was discharged home with close oncology follow-up. It is imperative to recognize malignant pericardial effusion as one of the causes of dyspnea. Emergent pericardiocentesis may be needed in case of hemodynamic compromise and tenuous clinical status."

    "abstract": "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a syndrome of refractory vasculitis involving the upper respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, and systemic small and medium-sized arteries that affects all age groups. No pediatric case with a bloody pericardial effusion resulting in cardiac tamponade and co-existing hematochezia has been reported. A 14-year-old boy was referred for evaluation of prolonged fever, chest pain, and intermittent hematochezia. Diagnostic imaging showed a prominent pericardial effusion. Immediately after admission, his systolic blood pressure decreased. Emergent pericardiocentesis resulted in aspiration of a massive amount of bloody pericardial fluid. This was diagnosed as cardiac tamponade because his blood pressure recovered immediately after the drainage. The patient had an elevated serine proteinase 3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) level on serological examination. Head MRI showed thickening of nasal and sinusoidal mucosa and a cystic mass in the left sphenoid sinus. After ruling out malignancy based on the cytology of the effusion, chest MRI, and gallium scintigraphy, total colonoscopy showed multiple irregular-shaped aphthae from the right transverse colon to the cecum on the contralateral side of the mesenteric attachments. Biopsy specimens of aphthous lesions confirmed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. A diagnosis of GPA was made based on these findings, and oral prednisolone (PSL) and azathioprine were started. The hematochezia disappeared rapidly, and no recurrence of pericardial effusion was seen after PSL tapering was completed. The PR3-ANCA level decreased into the normal range immediately after the initial therapy. Pericarditis is a common cardiac complication of GPA, but there have been no reports of resultant cardiac tamponade. This is the first case of pediatric GPA with cardiac and gastrointestinal complications preceding the common symptoms such as respiratory or renal symptoms. A case of pediatric GPA with hematochezia is also extremely rare. In conclusion, serial measurement of ANCA levels is important in patients with persistent fever and bloody stool, such as in inflammatory bowel disease, to make the diagnosis of a vasculitic syndrome."

Intraoperatively, a perforated MD was found and treated by surgical excision of the affected loop of bowel with end-to-end anastomosis and the specimens were sent for histopathological analysis. Histopathology revealed a perforated MD containing gastric mucosa. The patient had successful recovery. Early recognition with swift surgical intervention must take place to provide therapeutic outcome for patients and to limit the resulting morbidity. This case highlights the necessity of considering MD as core differential diagnosis in patients with acute abdomen. Due to the scarcity of data on perforated MDs in adult females, it's worthy of studying to highlight its incidence. Due to the rarity of a perforated MD in an adult female, it's worthy to consider such cases to explore preoperative assessment techniques, surgical interventions options, and postoperative complications."

    "abstract": "Celiac artery (CA) dissection due to blunt abdominal trauma is extremely rare and, as such, the clinical features of this potentially life-threatening injury have not been clearly defined, nor have treatment strategies been established. We describe the case of a 61-year-old man who presented to our emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. Although the patient did not report abdominal pain, enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed CA dissection. The patient was treated conservatively using antiplatelet therapy and was discharged from the hospital on day 8, without complications. As abdominal pain is not a common presenting factor of CA dissection after blunt trauma, it should be suspected as a potential injury in all affected patients and comprehensively assessed, with CT being the most useful diagnostic modality. In the absence of any signs of organ ischemia, changes in the CA aneurysm, and persistent, severe abdominal pain following blunt abdominal trauma, conservative treatment is indicated, with or without anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy."

    "abstract": "Patients who suffer a cardiac arrest from trauma rarely survive. Surgical control of hemorrhage cannot be obtained in time to prevent irreversible organ damage. Emergency preservation and resuscitation (EPR) was developed to utilize hypothermia to buy time to achieve hemostasis and allow delayed resuscitation. Large animal studies have demonstrated that cooling to tympanic membrane temperature 10 °C during exsanguination cardiac arrest can allow up to 2 h of circulatory arrest and repair of simulated injuries with normal neurologic recovery. The Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation for Cardiac Arrest from Trauma (EPR-CAT) trial is testing the feasibility and safety of initiating EPR. Study subjects include patients with penetrating trauma who lose a pulse within 5 minutes of hospital arrival and remain pulseless despite standard care. EPR is initiated via an intra-aortic flush of ice-cold saline solution. Following hemostasis, delayed resuscitation and rewarming are accomplished with cardiopulmonary bypass. The primary outcome is survival to hospital discharge without significant neurologic deficits. If trained team members are available, subjects can undergo EPR. If not, subjects can be enrolled as concurrent controls. Ten EPR and 10 control subjects will be enrolled. If successful, EPR could save the lives of trauma patients who are currently dying from exsanguinating hemorrhage."

A 65-year-old man with IgG4-RD has suffered from recurrent episodes of arterial aneurysms since 2003. He presented with chest pain and hypotension caused by localized cardiac tamponade at right ventricle free wall due to the rupture of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) of left anterior descending artery (LAD). An urgent LAD aneurysm repaired with bovine pericardium and obliterated aneurysmal sac with cryo-acrylate glue was done together with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using saphenous vein graft (SVG) to LAD and SVG to posterior descending artery. Three-month after surgery, the follow-up coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) revealed a growing in size of LAD and the second obtuse marginal (OM) branch aneurysm. Heart team discussion agreed to schedule the patient for double coil embolization to LAD and second OM aneurysm under intravascular ultrasound guidance. Both aneurysms were successfully obliterated with vascular coils. Two-week follow-up coronary angiogram showed complete occlusion of LAD aneurysm and near occlusion of the second OM branch aneurysm. Coronary artery aneurysm rupture is a life-threatening condition that required prompt detection and treatments. In IgG4-RD patients, acute cardiac tamponade suggesting the rupture of CAA. Coil embolization is an alternative treatment in patients who suffered from recurrent CAA after surgical repair. Serial CCTA is important for early detection of aneurysm in IgG4-RD patients who had vascular involvement."

We managed a 31-year-old male who, in addition to typical features of obstructive shock secondary to increased intrathoracic pressures, had a recent meal prior to the trauma and a scaphoid abdomen at presentation. We argue that a history of a recent meal before trauma and an unusually scaphoid abdomen could be suggestive of tension gastrothorax and may help to differentiate it from tension pneumothorax. We recommend improved emergency preparedness to help recognise and treat this pathology."

It is usually associated with fatal outcomes due to its physiological hormonal interaction. We report a successful anaesthetic and surgical management for a patient who presented to us with a huge hemorrhagic ACC which was complicated with acute respiratory failure. A 56-year-old lady presented to us with progressive abdominal distension and right hypochondriac pain for two months. She was anemic with elevated liver enzymes. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis showed a huge right supra renal mass. She subsequently developed respiratory failure due to splinting of diaphragm, of which successfully underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy. Subsequent endocrine and histopathological work up showed an adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Suprarenal masses usually originate from the adrenal glands. They should be investigated to rule out phaeochromocytoma, which originate from the inner adrenal medulla or outer cortex to form ACC. The latter usually occur in women and of poor prognosis. Huge ACC may cause acute respiratory failure by way of splinting of diaphragm. Both anaesthetic and surgical teams should be well trained in handling patients who undergo adrenal surgeries. A giant hemorrhagic functional ACC is extremely uncommon with very poor prognosis. Such conditions should be investigated to rule out phaeochromocytoma. Its potential neuro-hormonal interactions and anatomical correlations can cause fatal perioperative cardio-respiratory embarrassment. The anaesthetic and surgical teams should be capable in managing the hemodynamic instabilities that may present during surgical manipulation and resection of a large ACC."

    "abstract": "Blunt cardiac injury (BCI), defined as an injury to the heart from blunt force trauma, ranges from minor to life-threatening. The majority of BCIs are due to motor vehicle accidents; however, injuries caused by falls, blasts, and sports-related injuries also can be sources of BCI. A significant proportion of patients with BCI do not survive long enough to receive medical care, succumbing to their injuries at the scene of the accident. Additionally, patients with blunt trauma often have coexisting injuries (brain, spine, orthopedic) that can obscure the clinical picture; therefore, a high degree of suspicion often is required to diagnose BCI. Traditionally, hemodynamically stable injuries suspicious for BCI have been evaluated with electrocardiograms and chest radiographs, whereas hemodynamically unstable BCIs have received operative intervention. More recently, computed tomography and echocardiography increasingly have been utilized to identify injuries more rapidly in hemodynamically unstable patients. Transesophageal echocardiography can play an important role in the diagnosis and management of several BCIs that require operative repair. Close communication with the surgical team and access to blood products for potentially massive transfusion also play key roles in maintaining hemodynamic stability. With proper surgical and anesthetic care, survival in cases involving urgent cardiac repair can reach 66%-to-75%. This narrative review focuses on the types of cardiac injuries that are caused by blunt chest trauma, the modalities and techniques currently used to diagnose BCI, and the perioperative management of injuries that require surgical correction."

A finding suggestive of malrotation with midgut volvulus on abdominal imaging is the \"whirlpool\" sign where the superior mesenteric vein and superior mesenteric artery twist at the root of the abdominal mesentery. This sign was once thought to be pathognomonic, but recent studies have shown that it can be seen in asymptomatic patients. A 20-year-old female presented to our emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain. Computed tomography demonstrated the \"whirlpool\" sign with a concern for malrotation with midgut volvulus. Surgical consultation was obtained and the patient was rushed to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. Normal mesenteric attachments were seen and no significant pathology was identified during the laparotomy. The patient was eventually diagnosed with gastritis and discharged in stable condition. Emergency physicians and surgeons alike should be cautious in confirming malrotation with midgut volvulus solely due to the \"whirlpool\" sign on abdominal imaging. Premature diagnostic closure can lead to unnecessary procedures and interventions for patients as in the case we report here."

An eighty-one-year-old male presented to our emergency department with deterioration of consciousness, fever, and hematuria. He denied previous trauma history and had been treated for neurogenic bladder. Physical examination revealed signs of tenderness in the abdomen. A diagnosis of bladder rupture was made based on laboratory examination indicating renal failure and radiological imaging showing urinary ascites. Conservative management with a Foley catheter and antibiotics (meropenem administered 1 g/day) was initiated. On day seven after admission, the patient complained of abdominal pain and fever, and a diagnosis of pelvic abscess based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and septic peritonitis was made. An emergency exploratory laparotomy for peritoneal drainage was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 29 after admission. Urinary bladder rupture should always be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with free fluid in the abdomen, peritonitis, reduced urine output, and hematuria. Clinicians should be aware that secondary bacterial peritonitis can occur as a major complication of a ruptured urinary bladder."

A retrospective observational study was performed for all the SLE patients admitted to King Saud Medical City between 2016 and 2019. The primary reason for hospitalization was determined by the primary physician caring for the patient at the time of admission. Of the 98 hospitalizations for SLE, 49% of patients were admitted from the emergency department (ED) and 51% from the rheumatology clinic. The most common reason for hospitalization was lupus flare (68.4%) followed by infection (20.4%). The lupus flare patients commonly presented with musculoskeletal (MSK)symptoms (34.6%), renal manifestations (25.5%), and skin rash (24.5%), whereas patients admitted with infection were commonly diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (12.2%). Other hospitalization causes were obstetric complications, adverse drug reactions, and thrombosis. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was necessary for 7% of patients due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary hemorrhage (28.6%) or other reasons (14.1%), such as pleural effusion, cardiac tamponade, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Conclusions: The two most common reasons for SLE hospitalization were lupus flare and infection. Lupus flare was mainly due to MSK, renal, and dermatologic manifestations. The most common infection leading to hospitalization was community-acquired pneumonia, and ICU admission was mainly due to ARDS and pulmonary hemorrhage."

A large paucity of data exists among LMICs, therefore limiting comparisons on a global perspective. This study aimed to evaluate the ED burden of head injuries in a rural setting, within a LMIC. A retrospective chart review of all ED patients presenting with head injuries was conducted over a 3-month period. Relevant data was extracted using a data collection tool, followed by descriptive statistical analysis. A total of 263 patients were identified, with a median age of 27 years and male predominance (78.7%). Interpersonal violence (IPV) was the mechanism of injury in 59.7% (n = 157) of cases, followed by road traffic injuries (23.2%) and non-intentional trauma (17.1%). Most injuries were because of blunt trauma (71.1%) and common types were soft tissue (46.2%) and scalp injuries (35.0%). In the paediatric subgroup, the most common mechanism of injury was falls, accounting for 52.0% of all falls in the study. The majority (71.5%) of patients were discharged, while 22.8% were admitted and 2.67% demised in the ED. At this rural centre, there is a high ED burden of minor head injuries because of IPV, with a strong male predominance. This study serves to add to limited reported data from a LMIC setting, which appears to have a skewed burden compared to the global data."

However, it is not complication-free, and cardiac perforation is one of its most life-threatening complications. As surgery is usually not the first-line treatment for this emergent episode, there were only very few sporadic surgical reports in the literature. This systemic review primarily aims to collect different surgical approaches for catheter-induced cardiac perforation to help surgeons manage this kind of uncommon and critical patients. Of the 452 initially screened articles, 22 studies (38 patients) were included in the systemic review. Of all the included patients, 84% (32/38) were found to have pericardial effusion acutely following catheter-related procedures, and 16% (6/38) experienced delayed-onset episodes. Regarding the surgical procedures, four patients underwent removal of clots only, eight patients underwent suture repair of the left ventricle (LV), nine patients underwent suture repair of the right ventricle (RV), five patients underwent suture repair of the LA, and four patients underwent sutureless repair of the LV and pulmonary vein (LV 1, RV 1, pulmonary vein 1). In addition to repair of perforation sites, the concomitant combined procedures included repair of intercostal vessels (complication of pericardiocentesis) for one patient, cryoablation for two patients, and maze procedure for one patient. For cardiac perforation following catheter ablation or electrophysiology study, although the majority of the patients are treated with pericardiocentesis and medical management at first, cardiovascular surgeons have to prepare to take over if the bleeding is persistent or if the cardiac tamponade is not relieved."

A hyperechoic mass, with ultrasonographic echogenicity similar to fat, was found in the right cranial abdomen and believed to be associated with the mesentery. Cytological examination of abdominal fluid identified marked extramedullary hematopoiesis within the hemorrhagic effusion. Exploratory laparotomy identified a hepatic mass, which was resected, and revealed to be a hepatic myelolipoma on histopathological examination. The patient's initial recovery was uneventful. However, continued hyporexia resulted in readmission 4 days postoperatively, at which time the patient was found to have a profound, tri-lineage pancytopenia, and cytological evidence indicative of bone marrow recovery. The pancytopenia resolved with continued medical management and supportive care. Ruptured myelolipoma is not a commonly considered differential for nontraumatic hemoabdomen in cats. Furthermore, severe pancytopenia is unexpected following surgical resection of a myelolipoma.

In the present study we aim to determine chest wall thickness (CWT) at ICS2-MCL and ICS4/5-AAL in normal weight-, overweight- and obese patients, and to calculate theoretical success rates of ND for these locations based on standard catheter length. We performed a prospective multicenter study of a convenience sample of adult patients presenting in Emergency Departments (ED) of 2 university hospitals and 6 teaching hospitals participating in the XXX consortium.

Here we report a successful emergency surgery for bleeding ileal varices in a patient with cirrhosis due to autoimmune hepatitis. A 60-year-old woman was admitted for rectal bleeding. She had a history of autoimmune hepatitis. She was treated by endoscopic ligation for oesophageal varices. Eso-gastro-duodenal fibroscopy and colonoscopy failed to reveal the bleeding site. CT scan was then performed showing ileal varices due to a portocaval shunt, there was a communication between the superior mesenteric vein and the right internal iliac vein. As the embolization was not feasible and the bleeding did not stop, an exploratory laparotomy was performed showing two dilated veins on the surface of the ileal wall, communicating with the right internal iliac vein. We performed a ligation of the vessels. Postoperative course was uneventful. Ectopic varices are a rare case of gastrointestinal bleeding. Most of those patients have portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Diagnosing bleeding ileal varices is difficult because endoscopic examination can't always reveal the bleeding site. Interventional radiology is a good option for patients having bleeding ileal varices knowing that they often have advanced liver cirrhosis making them poor candidates for surgery. Haemostasis by endoscopy is often temporary and bleeding frequently recurs. Surgery should be considered if non-invasive treatments failed to ensure the haemostasis. Bleeding ileal varices is a rare situation. Interventional radiology and endoscopy can be good options. If not feasible, surgical treatment should not be delayed."

On multivariable logistic regression analysis with backward elimination, age (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.02-1.18) and serum proteins (OR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.998) were independently associated with the odds of mortality after EGS in the immediate CTS phase. Respiratory failure is the most common complication of EGS immediately after CTS. The older the patient and the lower the serum proteins, the higher the odds of mortality in patients who undergo EGS after ETS."

    "title": "Amoebic liver abscess in a COVID-19 patient: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Amoebiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Entamoeba histolytica, which affects people living in low- and middle-income countries and has intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. To date, knowledge on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) coinfection with enteric parasites is limited, and E. histolytica coinfection has not been previously described. Here we present the case of a patient with COVID-19 who, during hospitalisation, presented a clinical picture consistent with an amoebic liver abscess (ALA). A 54-year-old man, admitted as a suspected case of COVID-19, presented to our hospital with dyspnoea, malaise, fever and hypoxaemia. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. After 7 days, he developed diarrhoea, choluria and dysentery. An abdominal ultrasound showed a lesion compatible with a liver abscess; stool examination revealed E. histolytica trophozoites, and additional serology for E. histolytica was positive. After 12 days of treatment with metronidazole, ceftazidime and nitazoxanide, the patient reported acute abdominal pain, and an ultrasound examination revealed free liquid in the abdominal cavity. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed, finding 3000 mL of a thick fluid described as \"anchovy paste\". Computed tomography scan revealed a second abscess. He ended up receiving 21 days of antibiotic treatment and was discharged with satisfactory improvement. Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of ALA and COVID-19 co-presenting. Based on their pathophysiological similarities, coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and E. histolytica could change the patient's clinical course; however, larger studies are needed to fully understand the interaction between these pathogens."

    "abstract": "In the gynecological literature, a limited number of studies have reported intraperitoneal bleeding due to abdominal blunt trauma. In this report, we describe a rare case of massive intraabdominal hemorrhage from the uterine artery triggered by a fall injury without apparent abdominal bruising in the presence of severe endometriosis and a uterine fibroid. A 28-year-old woman who fell from a railway platform was transported to an emergency hospital. Although she did not sustain abdominal bruising and initially had no abdominal symptoms, she complained of gradually worsening abdominal pain. Abdominal CT identified intraabdominal massive hematoma, and emergency exploratory laparoscopy revealed active bleeding from the right uterine artery eroded by endometriosis, which was treated with laparoscopic electrocoagulation. The cause of the intraabdominal bleeding was associated with avulsion of the endometriosis adhesion between the right perimetrium and the right uterine artery due to inertial forces of the uterus during the fall injury. A uterine fibroid discovered during laparoscopy was suspected to strengthen the inertial forces of the uterus. In the case of hemoperitoneum after trauma, gynecological sources of bleeding must be kept in mind, especially for patients with a known history of fibroids or endometriosis."

    "abstract": "Abdominal and pelvic hemorrhage may be secondary to a number of causes and is often a medical emergency. Patient presentation ranges from obvious trauma with evidence of hemodynamic instability to vague symptoms. CT has become the imaging modality of choice for identifying abdominopelvic hemorrhage. Recognizing acute hemorrhage as well as identifying its location and severity are key to expediting management. In the Emergency Department, ultrasound often used in the initial evaluation of trauma patients, but is not sensitive for subtle bleeds or injuries. CT is the best first-line imaging tool to identify abdominal hemorrhage and, compared with angiography, has been shown to be superior in detecting intra-abdominal bleeding, especially when the bleeding rate is low. Depending on location and etiology, abdominopelvic hemorrhage may have a characteristic appearance, such as the \"sentinel clot\" sign associated with blunt trauma to the solid organs or the \"triangle sign\" of a mesenteric bleed. The following pictorial essay reviews CT technique, study interpretation, and interpretative pearls and pitfalls in the recognition of acute abdominopelvic hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiology, demographics, injury characteristics and outcomes of patients who presented to Swiss trauma centers following severe penetrating trauma. Swiss Trauma Registry (STR)-cohort analysis including patients with severe (ISS ≥ 16 or AIS head ≥ 3) penetrating trauma between 2017 and 2019. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and prehospital times. During the 3-year study period, 134 (1.6% of entire STR) patients with severe penetrating trauma were identified [64 (48%) gunshot wounds (GSW), 70 (52%) stab wounds (SW)]. Median age was 40.5 (IQR 29.0-59.0) and 82.8% were male. Mortality rate was 50% for GSW; 9% for SW. Overall, prehospital time [incident to arrival emergency department (ED)] was 65 (IQR 45-94) minutes. The median number of patients admitted for a severe GSW/SW per center and year was 2 (range 0-14). Of 64 patients who sustained a GSW, 42 (65.6%) were self-inflicted. Mortality in self-inflicted GSW reached 66.7%, with the head being severely injured in 78.6%. The 67 patients with severe isolated torso GSW/SW had an ISS of 20 (IQR 16-26) and a mortality of 15%. Multivariable analysis identified severe chest trauma, ED Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8, age, self-infliction, massive blood transfusion and ISS as independent predictors for mortality. Severe penetrating trauma is very rare in Switzerland. Mortality ranges from 9% in SW to 67% in self-inflicted GSW. Particularly in the setting of GSW/SW to the torso, reduction in prehospital time may further improve patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "7 horses (3 geldings, 2 mares, and 2 stallions) were examined because of acute colic caused by small intestinal obstruction involving the aborad portion of the jejunum and orad portion of the ileum. All horses underwent a routine colic examination on arrival and had a diagnosis of strangulating obstruction of the small intestine. All horses underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy, in which the affected aborad portion of the jejunum and orad portion of the ileum were resected; in 5 horses, a hand-sewn end-to-end jejuno-ileal anastomosis was combined with a hand-sewn incomplete ileocecal bypass to produce a hybrid jejuno-ileo-cecal anastomosis. In 2 horses, the hand-sewn end-to-end jejuno-ileal anastomosis was combined with a half-stapled, half-hand-sewn incomplete ileocecal bypass. The procedures restored continuity of the small intestine with partial bypass of the ileocecal valve. All horses survived to hospital discharge, and none developed colic or ileus during the postoperative period. Follow-up revealed that 6 horses were living and had no subsequent signs of colic (4 to 17 months after surgery), and 1 was euthanized because of colic 17 months after surgery. Results for these horses suggested the hybrid jejuno-ileo-cecal anastomosis could be considered as an option for the resolution of small intestinal strangulating lesions involving the orad portion of the ileum. Studies are needed to assess short-term and long-term effects of the procedure in horses."

Patients who received hip arthroscopy for GSWs from 2006 to 2020 by 2 surgeons at a level I trauma center were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Inclusion criteria were those patients who suffered a GSW to the hip, received hip arthroscopy for treatment, and had a minimum follow-up of 2 months. The exclusion criteria were any patients younger than 18 years of age. Medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, surgical details, clinical outcomes, and complications. A total of 50 hip arthroscopy cases were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes. Of the 50 cases identified, 8 patients met the inclusion criteria. All 8 patients were male, African-American, and the mean age was 31 years (range, 19-54 years) with mean follow-up of 14 months. Five of 8 cases were noted to have poor visualization with arthroscopy. Common reasons for poor visualization were difficult access to the bullet fragments, morbid obesity, hematoma formation, and pre-existing arthritis. Of these 5 cases, 2 were converted to open procedures to retrieve the remaining bullet fragments. One patient developed abdominal compartment syndrome, most likely due to increased pulse pressure over a prolonged operative period and involvement of the acetabular fovea. Emergent exploratory laparotomy and abdominal compartment fluid release were performed, and the patient had an otherwise unremarkable hospital course. There are risks with the use of arthroscopic methods to remove GSW fragments, which may be greater than elective hip arthroscopy. Certain factors, such as the surgeon's arthroscopic experience, locations of bullets fragments, visual quality, length of procedure, and concomitant acetabular fractures, must be considered before proceeding with arthroscopy.

    "title": "Hemodynamic Effect of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta in Hemodynamic Instability Secondary to Acute Cardiac Tamponade in a Porcine Model.",
    "abstract": "The pre-hospital use of Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) is increasing, although it remains controversial, in part because of suggested contraindications such as acute cardiac tamponade (ACT). As both the pre-hospital and in-hospital use of REBOA might potentially occur with concurrent ACT, knowledge of the hemodynamic effect of REBOA in this setting is crucial. This study, therefore, aimed at investigating the physiological effects of REBOA in hemodynamic instability secondary to ACT in a porcine model. We hypothesize that REBOA can temporarily increase systemic blood pressure and carotid blood flow, and prolong survival, in hemodynamic shock caused by ACT. Fourteen pigs (24-38 kg) underwent ACT, through true cardiac injury and hemorrhage into the pericardial space, and were allowed to hemodynamically deteriorate. At a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 50 mm Hg (SBP50) they were randomized to total occlusion REBOA in zone 1 or to a control group. Survival, hemodynamic parameters, carotid blood flow (CBF), femoral blood flow (FBF), cardiac output (CO), end-tidal CO2, and arterial blood gas parameters were analyzed. REBOA intervention was associated with a significant increase in SBP (50 mm Hg to 74 mm Hg, P = 0.016) and CBF (110 mL/min to 195 mL/min, P = 0.031), with no change in CO, compared to the control group. At 20 min after SBP50, the survival rate in the intervention group was 86% and in the control group 14%, with time to death being significantly longer in the intervention group. This randomized animal study demonstrates that REBOA can help provide hemodynamic stabilization and prolong survival in hemodynamic shock provoked by ACT. It is important to stress that our study does not change the fact that urgent pericardiocentesis or cardiac surgery is, and should remain, the standard optimal treatment for ACT.Level of evidence: Prospective, randomized, experimental animal study. Basic science study, therapeutic."

The present study is an attempt to identify the status of pre-hospital orthopaedic trauma care in developing countries during COVID-19 pandemic. This was a prospective observational study carried out in a tertiary care setup from March 25th, 2020 to January 31st, 2021. All the data pertaining to the traumatic injuries including demographic details and epidemiologic characteristics were recorded in an electronic database. A total of 1044 patients were included in the study for evaluation. The mean age was 35.24 ± 19.84 years. There were 873 males and 171 females. A total of 748 presented from nearby states, with 401 being the referrals and 347 cases coming directly to hospital. A total of 141 open fractures presented directly and 269 were referred from nearby states. Out of 269 cases of open fractures, only 67 and 139 were given intravenous antibiotics and had wound dressing done respectively at the periphery site. A total of 125, 112, 92 and 84 patients were received without traction/splintage, intravenous fluids, dose of analgesics and recording of vitals respectively. Delay from injury to presentation in emergency/administration of antibiotic (Hours) was 7.06. Road side accidents were main cause comprising of 52.58% cases. Gustilo Anderson classification grade-2 comprised of majority of the open fractures (51.63%). Lower limb fractures comprised of majority of the injuries (70.59%). Majority were adults and conservative management was the most common mode of treatment. A total of 197 and 265 patients had associated head injuries and blunt trauma chest/blunt trauma abdomen respectively. Emphasizing on pre-hospital care measures, with special focus on co-ordination between primary, secondary and tertiary health care facilities is the need of the hour and can prevent additional morbidities, avoiding overburden of the already compromised healthcare centres."

    "abstract": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders caused by a defect in collagen synthesis and structure. The vascular subtype (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome IV) is reported to be associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal perforations. The most reported site of perforation is the colon, followed by the small bowel. Perforation of the stomach is very rare, and there are no reported cases to date of classic types I and II. We present the case of a 14-year-old Saudi girl who visited our emergency department with abdominal pain and vomiting. Initially, she was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and discharged once her condition stabilized. After 48 hours, she developed severe abdominal pain with recurrent vomiting and peritonitis evident on clinical examination. Initial abdominal x-ray failed to show any free air; however, enhanced computed tomography revealed free air and contrast extravasation in the proximal gut. During exploratory laparotomy, a large perforation was found on the anterior wall of the stomach due to the underlying ischemia. The posterior wall had ischemic mucosa with an intact healthy serosa. A free-hand partial gastrectomy was performed to resect all ischemic parts of the stomach. Detailed examinations and laboratory workup were carried out after the surgery to figure out the possible underlying cause. The clinical findings during the physical examination supported marfanoid features. Marfan's syndrome and related disorders sequencing panel was requested, and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples were sent. Given results were supporting the diagnosis of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the patient was labeled as a case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. During the postoperative period, she developed a wound infection that was managed successfully with vacuum-assisted closure dressing. She recovered well without gastrointestinal sequelae in the 4 years of follow-up. Heritable systemic connective tissue diseases must be given serious consideration in young patients with unusual spontaneous perforation. Such patients might develop life-threatening conditions that require immediate intervention. Hence, correct and timely diagnosis is important to prepare for the anticipated complications."

    "abstract": "Foreign body ingestion is a common clinical scenario found in clinical practice. Perforations related to foreign bodies are rare, but they can present as a serious condition in emergency surgery services. The most common sites of perforation are angled areas, such as: ileocecal valve, sigmoid colon, duodenojejunal flexure and small intestine. We are going to describe a rare case of extensive perforation of rectosigmoid transition, without associated obstructive clinical picture, related to voluntary ingestion of foreign body caused by multiple seeds of a typical amazon fruit. This case report describes the presentation and management of a 46-year-old man who presented signs of acute perforating abdomen, without obstructive condition, after ingestion of foreign body. Imaging examination revealed the presence of foreign bodies with signs of intestinal perforation. Exploratory laparotomy was performed to treat the lesion and remove foreign bodies. Bowel perforation by a non-sharp foreign body is a rare complication of object ingestion. Object shape, quantity, narrowing of gastrointestinal tract are factors that can favor perforation. The clinic is not very specific, usually preceded by when obstructive or sub occlusive, and the clinical history is relevant for diagnostic formulation. Regions and cultures with a high intake of food with seeds may constitute an extra risk factor. The importance of alerting surgical teams to the possibility of bowel perforation without associated occlusive conditions caused by multiple non-sharp seeds is highlighted, as well as the need for early treatment aiming at favorable clinical outcome."

    "abstract": "To cope with the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany, the government imposed a lockdown, which led to restrictions and lifestyle changes for the population. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on activities causing trauma and the consultation in emergency rooms. All consecutive trauma patients consulting the Emergency Department of the Marienhospital Stuttgart (MHS), Germany, during the 6 weeks preceding the lockdown, during and after the lockdown were included. The time and type of consultation, treatment received, Manchester triage score, type of trauma, the anatomical region of the injury as well as demographic data were reported and compared. The study included 551 cases during lockdown, 943 cases before and 783 cases after the lockdown. We observed a reduced caseload during the lockdown of 41.6% compared to before and of 29.7% compared to after (p < 0.001). Patients were on average older in the observation group than in both control groups (before : 51.5 years, lockdown: 56.1 years, after: 51.6 years) (p < 0.001). Injuries to the head and neck were constant (25.0%, 25.4%, 25.5%). We noticed lower limb injuries decreasing (26.1%, 22.3%, 22.7%) and upper limb injuries increasing (25.5%, 31.8%, 30.1%). A decrease in sports injuries (11.1%, 5.1%, 9.1%) and work accidents (16.1%, 10.7%, 12.8%) resulted in more domestic accidents (30.4%, 52.5%, 31.8%). Self-referral decreased (67.7%, 53.2%, 60.3%) while referral via paramedics increased (28.3%, 38.7%, 35.6). Blunt trauma was the most common cause of injury (55.6%, 61.0%, 55.3%). Indications for surgery were higher (16.8%, 21.6%, 14.0%). The lockdown and restrictions in personal life and daily routine had an impact on the frequency, etiology and management of trauma patients in Stuttgart. HINTERGRUND: Zur Eindämmung des COVID-19-Ausbruchs erließ die Bundesregierung einige Regeln und Einschränkungen für die Bürger. ZIEL: Diese Studie widmet sich dem Einfluss der Maßnahmen auf traumatologische Vorstellungen in der Notaufnahme. Alle konsekutiven traumatologischen Patienten der Notaufnahme des Marienhospitals Stuttgart (MHS), die sich in den 6 Wochen jeweils vor und nach dem Lockdown sowie währenddessen vorstellten, wurden einbezogen. Die Zeit und Art der Vorstellung, die Behandlungsart, der Manchester Triage Score, die Region und Art der Verletzung sowie demografische Daten wurden ermittelt und verglichen. Es wurden 551 Fälle während des Lockdowns, 943 Fälle davor und 783 Fälle danach eingeschlossen. Es konnte eine Fallzahlreduktion um 41,6 % im Vergleich zu davor und um 29,7 % verglichen mit danach (p < 0,001) beobachtet werden. Während des Lockdowns waren die Patienten im Mittel älter (vorher: 51,5 Jahre, Lockdown: 56,1 Jahre, danach: 51,6 Jahre) (p < 0,001). Kopf-Hals-Verletzungen waren konstant (25,0 %, 25,4 %, 25,5 %). Verletzungen der unteren Extremität waren seltener (26,1 %, 22,3 %, 22,7 %), der oberen Extremität häufiger (25,5 %, 31,8 %, 30,1 %). Besonders Sportverletzungen (11,1 %, 5,1 %, 9,1 %) und Arbeitsunfälle (16,1 %, 10,7 %, 12,8 %) reduzierten sich, dafür stiegen häusliche Unfälle (30,4 %, 52,5 %, 31,8 %). Selbsteinweisungen gingen zurück (67,7 %, 53,2 %, 60,3 %), Vorstellungen mittels Rettungsdienst stiegen (28,3 %, 38,7 %, 35,6 %).

    "abstract": "Background  Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the infections of wound after an invasive operative approach. It remains to be a major morbidity for patients undergoing surgeries although there have been tremendous improvements in the surgical techniques. Different interventions to suppress the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been proposed. Many of them have been routinely used by surgeons like minimizing shaving, hand washing, and preoperative antibiotics and these are well accepted. Drains are used in major abdominal surgeries, hernia repairs, breast surgeries reducing collections in closed areas. 1 Hematoma, serous fluid, and dead space in surgical incision wounds raise the risk of infection as they serve as the platform for microbial growth. Studies have proved that the usage of subcutaneous drains has lowered the chances of infection. Results  The patients in the case group had lower incidence of SSI compared with the control group. The patients in the case group had subcutaneous drain which drained any collection that developed in the subcutaneous space. When the incidence of SSI was compared between the emergency cases and elective cases, the emergency cases showed higher propensity for SSI and increased rate for patients who had co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. The most common organism isolated from the SSI was found to be Escherichia coli . It was also noted that the mean number of days of hospital stay was comparatively higher for the patients who developed SSI compared with patients who did not develop SSI. Conclusion  Thus the presence of SSI adds morbidity to the patient and the patients who undergo major surgeries are likely to develop SSI postoperatively. The presence of subcutaneous closed suction drain helps in reducing the SSI to a certain extent."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is a rare condition, especially in children with no predisposing factors. In the vast majority of patients, this condition is benign and self-limiting; however, there is always the possibility that serious and potentially life-threatening complications such as mediastinitis or cardiac tamponade could arise. Early recognition, prompt diagnosis, and appropriate management allow for ideal care and prevent unnecessary and excessive investigations in these patients. An eight-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department with SPM after swimming and no known predisposing lung conditions. The probable causative event was likely to be pressure changes in the alveoli during swimming. This is notable because the patient's SPM occurred in the absence of an underlying cause such as asthma. The patient was admitted overnight for monitoring and pain control. The symptoms resolved the following day, along with a decrease in the size of the SPM on the chest X-ray. Physicians should be aware of the signs of SPM in young patients who present with chest pain in the absence of trauma or pulmonic disease.

We aimed to study the demographic profile, mode of injury, pattern of injury, and outcome of wild animal attack victims presented to the emergency department. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the emergency department of a tertiary-care hospital in Eastern India. Data were retrieved from the medical records from May 2017 to May 2021. Patients of all ages and genders attacked by wild animals and secondary injuries were included in this study. Patients with incomplete data, injuries due to the attack of stray and domestic animals and trauma due to other causes were excluded. Demographic profile, mode of injury, the pattern of injury, injury severity score (ISS), radiological pattern, and outcome were recorded. Statistical analysis with R (version 3.6.1.) was conducted. A total of 411 wild animal attack victims were studied, of which 374 (90.9%) were snakebite injuries and 37 (9.1%) were wild mammalian (WM) attack injuries. The mean age of WM attack victims was 46 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 4:1. Elephant attack injury (40.5%) was the most common WM attack injury reported. Most WM attacks (43.2%) occurred between 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. The median ISS was 18.5 (13-28), where 54.2% of patients had polytrauma (ISS>15). Elephant attack was associated with a higher ISS, but the difference was not significant compared to other animal types (p = 0.2). Blunt trauma was common pattern of injury in the elephant attack injury cases. Lacerations and soft tissue injuries were common patterns in other animal attacks. Among snakebites, neurotoxic was the most common type (55.4%), and lower extremity was the most common site involved. The young male population is the major victim of HWCs; and elephant is the most common animal involved. There is a need to design scientifically sound preventive strategies for HWCs and to strengthen the preparedness in health establishments to manage victims effectively."

A 64-year-old woman, with no history of ischemic heart disease, was admitted to the emergency department after developing sudden-onset dyspnea after a planned acupuncture treatment for back pain. Acute echocardiography showed decreased left ventricular function with basal hypercontraction and apical akinesia and was interpreted, and treated, as acute heart failure. When the attending cardiologist arrived, the patient still had dyspnea with a declining blood pressure (97/65 mmHg) and tachycardia (111/minute). The cardiologist suspected a tension pneumothorax induced by the penetration of an acupuncture needle to the apex of the lung, as well as secondary TSS cardiomyopathy. An acute chest X-ray was performed, which showed a large left-sided rim pneumothorax. The attending surgeon placed a chest tube in the left 6th intercostal space in the midaxillary line, and the patient reported immediate pain relief and improvement in her dyspnea. The patient's clinical condition improved, and a control X-ray showed that the lung was fully expanded. The chest tube was removed, but after a few minutes, the patient developed a massive subcutaneous emphysema in the upper chest and in the face and her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. A new chest tube was inserted, and the patient's tachycardia diminished, with her clinical condition improving immediately. The patient remained hospitalized for the next seven days. After three continuous days without any escaped air in the chest tube, the tube was removed, and the patient was observed for another 48 hours. This time, the removal was without any complications and within two days, the patient was ready for discharge. The follow-up echocardiography showed complete recovery of left ventricular function."

In advance of a large gathering in our metropolitan area, we developed and conducted a simulation to better prepare not only our residents, but our MCI planning committee, registered nurses (RNs) and emergency room technicians (ERTs) for an MCI.Emergency medicine is at the forefront of any hospital's response to an MCI. These events stretch the resources and force EDs to function differently than usual.1 Responding effectively is crucial to minimizing the morbidity and mortality of our patients while maximizing use of available resources. We can improve our level-headedness, efficiency, and department and hospital-level planning through simulation. This has particular implications for residency training with effects on education, preparedness, and wellness. The learners will (1) recognize state of mass casualty exercise as evidenced by verbalization or triaging by START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) criteria, (2) triage several patients, including critically ill or peri-arrest acuities, according to START criteria, (3) recognize the need to limit care based on available resources, as evidenced by verbal orders or communication of priorities to team, and (4) limit emergency resuscitation, given limited resources, by only providing treatments and employing diagnostics that do not deplete limited time, staffing, and space inappropriately. A small-scale, high-fidelity simulation was created to replicate the pace and acuity of patients presenting in an MCI. Three critically injured patients with multiple gunshot wounds, represented by high-fidelity manikins with moulaged wounds, were presented over a 6-minute span. The team was allowed 10 minutes total to conduct life-saving measures, targeted evaluation, and disposition of the patients. The simulation was then adapted for use in a second institution's simulation center to replicate and validate the objectives given a different system. The learners were immediately verbally debriefed and feedback of the simulation, fidelity and appropriateness of the experience solicited. Unprompted, several of the learners volunteered that the efficacy of the experience was highly educational and valuable. Anonymized digital feedback was requested in the form of an online survey and was generally positive.The educational content was created by experts in simulation medicine and validated by content experts in the fields of Emergency Medicine, Trauma Surgery and Emergency Nursing. After the scenario ended, the learners were taken to a second room for debriefing by a trauma surgeon, an emergency medicine attending, and the nurse trauma educator. The actors were able to participate as secondary learners and were rotated out of simulation duties to participate in the debriefing. After this twenty-minute educational debrief, the learners were brought back to the simulation bay and were given a similar scenario. After this iteration, the team debriefed a second time. This hour schedule of cases and debrief was repeated a total of four times with a total of twelve individual learners. Suggestions and verbal feedback were noted for incorporation into appropriate committees or hospital departments. No formal assessment was done and inclusion was strictly on a voluntary basis. An evaluation of the session (on a Likert scale of 1-5) had six respondents which showed an average of 5 on how educational the session was, 4.8 on how realistic the session was, and 4.8 on how effective the session was. Simulation allows participants to safely gain practical experience in MCI management. The experience was well-received, and the learners verbalized increased confidence should they encounter an MCI in the future. We developed this simulation to give residents and nurses first-hand experience performing under high-stress, resource-limited conditions. We also had other learners observing the process which allowed for productive debriefing and planning for improvement. The ideas generated from this ultimately became part of the hospital's MCI response plan. The main takeaways were triage strategy and limited resource management. Mass casualty incident, mass gathering, penetrating trauma, high-fidelity simulation, team-based simulation, trauma center, hospital response planning."

    "abstract": "A 16-year-old boy experienced a sudden loss of consciousness. On arrival, he was in cardiac arrest. An ultrasound study revealed a high-echoic layer surrounding the heart. He received a diagnosis of clotting cardiac tamponade. Urgent thoracotomy with pericardiotomy was performed, but he failed to obtain return of spontaneous circulation. Physicians should focus on not only low-echoic but also high-echoic areas to accurately diagnose clotting, which can result in a critical condition if not managed properly."

We report nine events of acute pericarditis (AP) in eight patients following COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 (6/9), AZD1222 (2/9) and mRNA-1273 (1/9). All patients were referred for AP temporally linked with COVID-19 vaccination. Chest pain was the most common clinical manifestation. Alternative etiologies were excluded upon thorough diagnostic work up. AP diagnosis was established according to ESC guidelines. Five events occurred after the first vaccine dose and four after the second. The mean age in this cohort was 65.8 ± 10.2 years and the men/women ratio 3/5. All events resolved without sequelae; two events were complicated by cardiac tamponade requiring emergent pericardial decompression. Hospitalization was required in four cases. Although causality cannot be firmly established, AP has emerged as a possible complication following COVID-19 vaccination. Further investigation is indispensable to fully characterize this new entity."

In adults, when small bowel intussusception occurs, it can be due to a malignant lead point. Malignant etiology is most frequently due to diffuse metastatic disease. We present a rare case of an 18-year-old woman who was diagnosed with jejunojejunal, jejunoileal, and colocolic intussusceptions. She presented with vomiting, abdominal pain, and passage of semisolid stools for 5 days. During emergency exploratory laparotomy, multiple polyps were found in the jejunum, ileum, and sigmoid. Jejunotomy and sigmoidotomy were done to remove the respective polyps. The ileal polyp showed hemorrhagic changes; hence, an intraoperative decision was taken to proceed with resection and anastomosis. On histopathological examination, the resected ileal part showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (grade 2) arising from an adenomatous polyp, while the jejunal polyp and sigmoid polyp were adenomatous polyps with low-grade dysplasia. Patient received six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPEOX regimen). After 2 years, she is symptom free with a normal colonoscopy. The treatment of intussusception in adults typically involves surgery, often with bowel resection as there is always a pathologic leading cause which may be malignant, like in our case."

This case report illustrates hemorrhagic cholecystitis (HC) as a rare complication of cholecystitis. A 74-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with intermittent abdominal discomfort and continued vomiting after any oral ingestion as well as watery diarrhea. Patient history included mitral valve replacement and a daily dose of warfarin. Emergent cross-sectional abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large mass that occupied most of the right abdominal cavity. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a necrotizing and hemorrhagic enlarged gallbladder with cholelithiasis. This enlargement appeared adherent and fistulizing into the cecum, without signs of bowel perforation. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient recovered well. Owing to its non-specific presentation, imaging studies are essential in establishing a diagnosis for HC. Although CT has not been advocated as a primary imaging examination for acute right upper quadrant pain, it is a valuable tool for assessing HC, along with MRI."

    "abstract": "Acquired arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are most commonly caused by direct arterial trauma, with 90% of traumatic AVFs due to penetrating trauma. Post-traumatic common carotid artery-internal jugular vein fistulae are rare, with an incidence of 4% to 7% of all traumatic AVFs. We present a case of delayed presentation of a patient with shortness of breath, neck pain, and worsening right upper extremity paresthesias 10 days after a blunt injury to the neck by an arrow. He was subsequently found to have a common carotid artery-internal jugular vein fistula and a common carotid pseudoaneurysm on computed tomography angiography. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Post-traumatic common carotid-jugular AVFs are uncommon, especially in patients with delayed presentations and a blunt injury mechanism. If left untreated, AVFs may progress to high-output cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, and embolization. Clinicians must be aware of this finding, given the potential for significant morbidity."

Here we present a 1 year follow-up of a patient with a secondary tension pneumothorax due to COVID-19 pneumonia. In May 2020, a 47-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with fever, dry cough, and sore throat as well as acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Sputum testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eleven days after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency department with pronounced dyspnoea after coughing. CT showed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, which was relieved by a chest drain (Buelau) via mini open thoracotomy. For a period of 3 months following resolution of the pneumothorax the patient complained of fatigue with mild joint pain and dyspnoea. After 1 year, the patient did not suffer from any persisting symptoms. The pulmonary function and blood parameters were normal, with the exception of slightly increased levels of D-Dimer. The CT scan revealed only discrete ground glass opacities (GGO) and subpleural linear opacities.

We elected to find the value of abdominal and pelvic CT in patients with negative physical examination and Focused Assessment of Sonography for Trauma (FAST) on arrival to the ED. This study is a retrospective analysis of 901 consecutive patients from 2017 to 2019 who presented to the ED with level 2 and 3 activation criteria. Each patient received a physical examination, CT abdomen and pelvis, and FAST exam. Data were collected on external factor including GCS, ISS, age, sex, comorbidities, anticoagulation use, and surgical intervention. The patients were divided into 2 groups, Group A and B. Group A consisted of patients with a negative physical exam, FAST, and CT result. Group B included patients with a negative physical exam and FAST exam with positive CT findings. Statistical analysis was done using a Student's t-test and chi-square test for significance value of P < .05. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study. A total of 901 patients were analyzed which included 489 (54.3%) male and 412 (45.7%) female with a mean age of 56.2 (SD = 22.62) years. Out of the 901 patients, 461 patients received a physical, FAST, and CT exam. Group A consisted of 442 (95.9%) patients and Group B had 19 (4.1%) patients. Both groups were similar in GCS and ISS scoring with no significance difference in age, sex, comorbidities, and anticoagulation use. There was a significant difference in the ICU and hospital mean length of stay when CT scan was positive [2 (SD = 4.23) days vs. .6 (SD = 1.33) days with P < .0001 and 4.57 (SD ± 4.17) days vs. 2.5 (SD = 2.00) days with P < .0001, respectively]. The CT findings of the 19 patients in group B consisted of 6 incidentalomas, 5 vertebral compression fractures, 4 pelvic bone fractures, 1 minor liver contusion, 1 non-specific bowel thickening, 1 non-displaced rib fracture, and 1 case of small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. None of the CT findings required surgical intervention. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis in trauma patients with high GCS and low ISS with initial negative physical and FAST examination did not provide additional critical information."

    "abstract": "Situs inversus totalis (SIT) is a rare anatomical variation of the thoracic and abdominal organs. It is a congenital anomaly with an incidence of 1:10,000 to 1:20,000. Patients with SIT do not have a decreased survival rate as compared to patients without SIT because SIT generally does not have a pathophysiologic significance. However, the anatomical variations in SIT can cause some challenges when assessing intraabdominal and intrathoracic symptoms or performing operations. We report a case of a 93-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and situs inversus totalis who presented with diffuse abdominal pain for 4 days. Abdominal exam was significant for diffuse tenderness. Computed tomography (CT) imaging was significant for pneumoperitoneum. She emergently underwent an exploratory laparotomy, descending hemicolectomy and left in discontinuity with an open abdomen. On postoperative day 2 she underwent a stamm feeding gastrostomy tube, incisional hernia repair, and maturation of end colostomy. Her remaining hospital course was complicated by a pelvic collection, which was managed by a percutaneous guided drain placement. She was ultimately discharge to rehab on hospital day 15. SITS can present a particularly challenging situation to clinical diagnoses and surgical procedures. However, when identified, these patients should warrant special considerations prior to proceeding with surgical intervention. This includes radiologic imaging and proper planning prior to the operating room, when possible. We herein present a case of colonic perforation in a patient with situs inversus totalis. Proper planning, thorough imaging, and careful execution are necessary to ensure patient safety and care in patients with SIT. However, in the case of emergency this should not delay definitive management."

Herein, we report a case of emergency tracheoplasty for the management of tracheal stent prolapse in a patient with blunt tracheobronchial trauma. This report highlights the necessity of being cautious about the migration and prolapse of tracheal stents, which can more frequently occur in blunt trauma than in malignant stenosis or iatrogenic injury. Due to the limitations of non-surgical treatments, early surgical intervention may be lifesaving."

Symptoms range from mild crepitus of the chest wall to the accumulation of air in the face and neck, which can ultimately result in cardiovascular compromise. The aim of this article is to present a rare case of cervical, facial and periorbital surgical emphysema following chest drain insertion, and describes a novel use of 'fish gill' incisions in the palpebromalar groove with an associated review of the literature. A 68-year-old gentleman presented with acute dyspnoea due to a right-sided tension pneumothorax. Emergency decompression with a Seldinger chest drain resulted in persistent cervical, facial and periorbital surgical emphysema causing difficulty in movement, inability to open the eyes and progressive risk to cervical venous return. \"Fish gill' incisions at the lateral-most edge of the palpebromalar groove, down to the level of the orbicularis oculi muscle, rapidly released air from the face and neck, alleviating discomfort, reducing venous compression and restoring vision. Cervical, fascial and periorbital surgical emphysema may be resolved with the use of \"fish gill\" incisions at the lateral palpebromalar groove and simple drains. To the best of our knowledge, this method has not been reported previously in the literature."

This study was conducted from 1st November 2018 to 31st March 2020 in ABVIMS &amp; Dr. R.M.L. Hospital, New Delhi. The potential candidates for the study were patients of 18 years and above who were admitted in surgical emergency and underwent emergency laparotomy by a midline incision. Fifty random patients were alternatively allotted to group A (25 patients) and group B (25 patients). In the patients of group A, closed incision negative pressure wound therapy (ciNPWT) was applied on midline closed wound after an exploratory laparotomy procedure. The patients in group B, standard dry gauze dressing was done. The mean age of patients in group A and group B were 46.76±12.20 and 41.96±8.33 years, respectively (p-value-0.11). The wound infection was present in 12% of cases in group A and 32% in group B, but when we calculate the p-value, it was found to be statistically non-significant (p-value-0.08). Similarly, seroma formation and wound dehiscence were found less in group A as compared to group B but not reached up to a statistically significant limit (p-value 0.55 and 0.38 respectively). The frequency of dressing change was 1-2 per week in 92% of cases in group A while it was 3-4 per week in 68% of cases in group B. The mean time of the frequency of dressing change was 1.24±0.72 per week and 4.28±1.90 per week in both the groups respectively (p-value &lt;0.001). There was no significant (p&gt;0.05) difference in the duration of hospital stay between group A (mean hospital stay 8.20±2.34 days) and group B (mean hospital stay 8.21±3.37 days). Closed incision negative pressure wound therapy has no advantages over conventional dressing in terms of post-operative complications and hospital stay. However, it reduces the frequency of dressing change significantly, which reduces the mental stress of the patient and the burden of changing daily dressing."

    "abstract": "In patients undergoing resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) for traumatic cardiac arrest, focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is often used to look for intraperitoneal fluid. These findings can help determine whether abdominal exploration is warranted once return of spontaneous circulation is achieved; however, the diagnostic accuracy of FAST in this clinical scenario has yet to be evaluated. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of FAST in identifying intra-abdominal hemorrhage following RT. We performed a 3-year retrospective study at a high-volume level 1 trauma center from 2014 to 2016. We included patients who underwent RT in the Emergency Department. All FAST examinations were performed by non-radiologists. Operative findings, computed tomography reports, diagnostic peritoneal aspirate (DPA) results, and autopsy findings were used as reference standards to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the FAST. A total of 158 patients met our inclusion criteria. The median age was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23-53), 86.1% were male, and 60.1% sustained blunt trauma. Most patients suffered severe injuries with a median injury severity score of 27 (IQR: 18-38). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of FAST for identifying intra-abdominal hemorrhage were 66.0%, 84.8%, 68.6%, 83.2%, and 78.5%, respectively. Among the 107 patients with a negative FAST, 22 (20.6%) underwent DPA, which was positive in 5 patients. FAST can be utilized in the diagnostic workup of trauma patients after RT. In patients with a positive FAST, exploratory laparotomy is warranted, whereas other diagnostic adjuncts such as DPA or mandatory abdominal exploration may be considered in patients with a negative FAST."

    "abstract": "Background: Police involvement in trauma management and transport is increasing in the US. Little is known about prehospital triage criteria and transport patterns used by Police Officers. In this study, we examined the impact of trauma designation level on the survival of trauma patients transported to trauma centers by police.Methods: We used the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) 2017 dataset in this retrospective observational study. Adult trauma patients transported by Police to Level I, II and III trauma centers were included. We performed a univariate analysis followed by a bivariate analysis. Finally, we carried out a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounders to assess the impact of trauma level designation on outcomes of patients transported by Police.Results: A total of 2,788 patients were included. The majority of the patients were males (84.6%) between the ages of 16 and 55 with half of them being African American. Most had a mild GCS (13-15) (89.5%) and only 17.4% were recorded to have severe traumatic injuries with ISS ≥ 16. The most common trauma type was blunt trauma (61.4%) followed by penetrating injuries (32.2%) and burns (1.5%). Around half of injuries were the result of assault (49.4%) and 43.0% were unintentional. Head and neck injuries were most common (40.8%) followed by extremities (27.4%) and torso injuries (25.0%). Approximately half of the patients were admitted to floor bed/observation unit/step-down unit (50.7%) while 18.9% and 19.8% went to the Operating Room or Intensive Care Unit respectively. Overall survival to hospital discharge was 93.2%. Survival was 91.6% in Level I, 98.2% in level II and 98.7% in Level III centers. After adjusting for significant confounders, survival to hospital discharge was similar for patients transported by police to level II and III trauma centers in comparison to those transported to level I (OR = 0.866 95%CI (0.321-2.333); p = 0.776).Conclusion: Transport of trauma patients by police to trauma centers of different designation levels was not associated with survival in this study. Survival was also similar to other trauma studies. As such, trauma patients may be safely transported by Police to closest trauma designated center without affecting outcomes."

    "abstract": "Subcutaneous emphysema (SE) and pneumomediastinum are commonly associated with critically ill patients with blunt or penetrating trauma, in particular lower rib fractures. It however rarely needs urgent intervention, and routine use of chest tube tracheostomy or mediastinal drains is not recommended as the patients do not go on to develop a respiratory compromise. Our case is novel as it describes a case of subcutaneous emphysema with acute upper airway compromise and respiratory distress requiring urgent bilateral wide bore subcutaneous drains and thoracic drain insertion. The patient required a prolonged recovery period. This case serves to illustrate the technical difficulty in establishing a cause of subcutaneous emphysema, the limitations of standard imaging in identifying a pneumothorax in subcutaneous emphysema, and the value of prompt insertion of bilateral subcutaneous wide bore drains to buy precious time for definitive imaging and management."

This study aims to assess the impact of a city-wide stay at home order on the volume, type, and outcomes of traumatic injuries at urban EDs. The study was a retrospective chart review of all patients who presented to the ED of an urban Level I Trauma Center and its urban community affiliate in the time period during the 30 days before the institution of city-wide shelter-in-place (preSIP) order and 60 days after the shelter-in-place (SIP) order and the date-matched time periods in the preceding year. Volume and mechanism of traumatic injuries were compared using paired T-tests. There was a significant decrease in overall ED volume. The volume of certain blunt trauma presentations (motor vehicle collisions) during the first 60 days of SIP compared to the same period from the year prior also significantly decreased. Importantly, the volume of penetrating injuries, including gunshot wounds and stab wounds, did not differ for the preSIP and SIP periods when compared to the prior year. The mortality of traumatic injuries was also unchanged during the SIP comparison period. While there were significant decreases in visits to the ED and overall trauma volume, penetrating trauma, including gun violence, and other severe traumatic injuries remain a public health crisis that affects urban communities despite social distancing recommendations enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "abstract": "Following blunt trauma, diagnosis of shoulder dislocation based on physical examination alone is difficult due to possible concurrent proximal humeral fractures. X-rays are therefore used to confirm diagnosis. Results from recent observational studies comparing diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) with X-rays for shoulder dislocation have been encouraging. The aim of this study was to determine whether PoCUS improves diagnostic accuracy when used with physical examination for the diagnosis of shoulder dislocation, proximal humeral fracture and ascertaining successful reduction in the ED. A prospective, single-centre, open, parallel randomised control study over a 6-month period was used to answer the research question and test the null hypothesis. Consecutive eligible adult patients attending the ED of Mater Dei Hospital in Malta were randomised to either the control (C) (physical examination only) or experimental group (E) (physical examination and a two-point PoCUS scan). The study objectives were to measure diagnostic accuracy for both examinations for detecting shoulder dislocation, any associated proximal humeral fractures and confirming reduction. X-rays were used as reference standard for both groups. 1206 patients were enrolled in this study (C n=600, E n=606). 290 dislocations (C n=132 and E n=158), 332 proximal humeral fractures (C n=154 and E n=178) and 278 reductions (C n=130 and E n=148) were analysed. A statistically significant difference (p<0.001) was found between the two groups for diagnostic accuracy in shoulder dislocation (C=65%, likelihood ratio (LR)+=2.03 and LR-=0.35 and E=100%, LR+=∞ and LR-=0), proximal humeral fractures (C=45.7%, LR+=1.23 and LR-=0.52 and E=98.3%, LR+=103.9 and LR-=0.03) and reduction (C=68.7%, E=100%). The null hypothesis for this study was thus rejected. The addition of PoCUS to a physical examination significantly improves diagnostic accuracy for dislocations, proximal humeral fractures and reduction confirmation.

    "abstract": "In equine anaesthesia, the recovery period is critical, accounting for most anaesthesia-related fatalities reported. Horses may recover unassisted or may be assisted, for example, using a head and tail rope recovery method. To compare the impact of head and tail rope and unassisted recovery method on quality of recovery in horses undergoing colic surgery under general anaesthesia (GA). Single centre retrospective cross-sectional study, with prospective model performance analysis. Clinical data were obtained from horses undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy over a 6-year period. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the perioperative factors that affect quality of recovery. The final prediction model was assessed prospectively. Records from 502 general anaesthetics (490 horses) were included. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that head and tail rope recovery (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.3, P < .001) and sevoflurane administration (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3, P = .02) were associated with better quality of recovery when compared with unassisted recovery and isoflurane administration respectively. Increasing GA duration (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.99-1.0, P = .03), increasing intraoperative dosages (in mg/kg) of thiopental (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.98, P = .02) or ketamine (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.99, P = .04) were linked to poor quality of recovery. No statistically significant difference was found between recovery groups in terms of mortality. The clinical prediction model obtained is only applicable to the specific facilities, recovery methodology, referral population and anaesthetic protocols practiced at our institution. Head and tail rope recovery is significantly associated with better quality of recovery, compared with unassisted recovery, in horses undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy. Sevoflurane administration, in detriment of isoflurane, was associated with better quality of recovery. Other risk factors, such as increasing GA duration, the use of higher intra-operative dosages of ketamine and/or thiopental, were associated with poor quality of recovery."

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induces a dysregulated immune response, leading to a drastic elevation of proinflammatory cytokines. This cytokine storm has the potential to aggravate any prior ongoing inflammation. Moreover, acute pancreatitis can cause local necrosis, thereby causing extensive abdominal inflammation. This condition increases the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and its deleterious consequences. We report the case of a 37-year-old male with a past medical history of chronic pancreatitis and alcohol use disorder who presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a tender abdomen. Initial workup showed elevated amylase and lipase, a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient denied any respiratory symptoms. Initial abdominal CT scan revealed mild pancreatic inflammation. The patient was admitted to the respiratory ICU and managed with fluid resuscitation and pain control. However, the patient had increasing oxygen requirements, leukocytosis, and worsening kidney function. A trans-bladder measurement of intra-abdominal pressure revealed severe ACS. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started; however, after 72 hours of treatment, the patient had a cardiopulmonary arrest. He returned to spontaneous circulation after advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol and intubation. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen showed necrotizing pancreatitis with a large-volume hemoperitoneum. Urgent pancreatic necrosectomy was performed with drainage of the hemoperitoneum. The patient was transferred to a long-term acute care facility for extended antibiotic therapy where he eventually recovered. This case illustrates the catastrophic consequences of necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by sepsis and ACS in a COVID-19-positive patient."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous bladder rupture SBR is a rare condition and often missed diagnosis, especially after a nontraumatic vaginal delivery. A 34-year-old patient who had a nontraumatic vaginal delivery presented to the emergency room 7 days later with acute abdomen and anuria. Computed tomography showed free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. An intraperitoneal rupture of the bladder dome was detected, showing extravasation of contrast into the peritoneal cavity. An exploratory laparotomy revealed a perforation on the bladder dome that was sutured. SBR following vaginal delivery is an extremely rare condition. It represents a surgical emergency. Due to the low incidence and the presence of non-specific symptoms, diagnosis was usually delayed with an increased morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should consider this diagnosis in the presence of an acute abdominal pain associated to anuria or dysuria. We therefore recommend that the bladder be catheterized or drained before labour. SBR is a rare and life-threatening condition in post-partum. Abdominal pain with elevated serum creatinine should be suspicious of urinary bladder rupture."

    "abstract": "Novel Coronavirus Disease in most cases produces mild symptoms which resolve after a few days. Some authors hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could trigger excessive cytokine production leading to a severe multi-organ disease requiring intensive care admission. Respiratory and neurological symptoms are the most frequently reported manifestation of the disease. Indeed, cardiac involvement is reported mostly as a part of a systemic disease. Few isolated cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection have been described. We report herein a case of SARS-CoV-2 related severe isolated pericardial involvement requiring ICU admission due to cardiac tamponade needing urgent drainage. Analysis of pericardial fluid from drainage demonstrated a higher cytokine concentration than blood values. Other causes of pericardial disease, such as autoimmunity, bacterial or other than COVID-19 infection, neoplasms or acute myocardial infarction were also evaluated, but all tests confirmed negative results. The suspicion of isolated involvement of the pericardium was therefore demonstrated by the analysis of cytokines which strongly support our hypothesis."

Studies of this particular injury are limited. The objective of this study was to characterize injury patterns and patient demographic characteristics for BC-related injuries. This was a retrospective, observational study on the victims of BC accidents admitted to the emergency department. Data on demographic characteristics, symptoms, physical examination signs, admission time, and outcomes were collected from the hospital database. The location of injuries and damaged tissues were also analyzed. One hundred and fifty-four male (90.1%) and 17 female (9.9%) patients were included retrospectively. Most injuries occurred in autumn (n = 90 [52.6%]) after the harvesting season. Ninety percent of the victims (n = 153) presented with lower extremity trauma. The most frequently injured body part was the anteromedial portion of the left foot (n = 61 [55.9%]). Seven (4.1%) cases had complete digits or limb amputations and 21 (12.3%) cases had incomplete amputation. Twenty-nine (17%) cases had a coexisting vascular injury, 61 (35.7%) had fractured bones, and 129 (75.4%) had tendon damage. BC-related accidents are often preventable but can result in severe disabilities or death. Therefore, health care facilities should be provided in regions at risk to reduce hazards."

    "abstract": "Penetrating injuries to the neck pose a unique challenge to clinicians due to the proximity of multiple significant anatomical structures with little protective soft tissue coverage. Injuries to this area, whilst low in incidence, are potentially devastating. Respiratory, vascular, gastro-oesophageal and neurological structures may all be involved, either in isolation or combination. These injuries are particularly difficult to manage in the resource poor, often austere and/or remote, pre-hospital environment. A systematic scoping review of the literature was conducted to evaluate the current available research pertaining to managing this injury profile, prior to the patient arriving in the emergency department. The available research is discussed in sections based on the commonly used trauma management acronym 'cABCD' (catastrophic haemorrhage, Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability) to facilitate a systematic approach and clinical evaluation familiar to clinicians. Based on the available reviewed evidence, we have proposed a management algorithm for this cohort of patients. From this we plan to instigate a Delphi process to develop a consensus statement on the pre-hospital management of this challenging presentation."

We report a case of amebic pericarditis complicated by cardiac tamponade, in which the diagnosis was missed initially and was made retrospectively by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of a stored sample of pericardial fluid. Furthermore, we performed a systematic review of the literature on amebic pericarditis. A 71-year-old Japanese man who had a history of sexual intercourse with several commercial sex workers 4 months previously, presented to our hospital with left chest pain and cough. He was admitted on suspicion of pericarditis. On hospital day 7, he developed cardiac tamponade requiring urgent pericardiocentesis. The patient's symptoms temporarily improved, but 1 month later, he returned with fever and abdominal pain, and multiple liver lesions were found in the right lobe. Polymerase chain reaction of the aspiration fluid of the liver lesion and pericardial and pleural fluid stored from the previous hospitalization were all positive for E. histolytica. Together with the positive serum antibody for E. histolytica, a diagnosis of amebic pericarditis was made. Notably, the diagnosis was missed initially and was made retrospectively by performing PCR testing. The patient improved with metronidazole 750 mg thrice daily for 14 days, followed by paromomycin 500 mg thrice daily for 10 days. This case suggests that, although only 122 cases of amebic pericarditis have been reported, clinicians should be aware of E. histolytica as a potential causative pathogen. The polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect E. histolytica in the pericardial effusion and was found to be useful for the diagnosis of amebic pericarditis in addition to the positive results for the serum antibody testing for E. histolytica. Because of the high mortality associated with delayed treatment, prompt diagnosis should be made."

    "abstract": "Colorectal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is quite aggressive and rare, only constituting less than 1% of all cases of colorectal cancer. The pericardium is an extremely rare first site of metastasis. Cardiac tamponade can be a life-threatening initial presentation. We report a 55-year-old female who presented with severe shortness of breath, intermittent abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. She had low blood pressure with congested neck veins. Her echocardiogram showed pericardial and cardiac infiltration with tumour mass; a large pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade. There was no safe window for percutaneous drainage, and the patient was not physically fit for surgical drainage. A multidisciplinary approach was used to diagnose and manage the case involving a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, pathologist, radiologist and oncologist. CT scans of the whole body showed a large rectosigmoid mass infiltrating the uterus and adnexa. Flexible sigmoidoscopy showed a large bleeding mass at the rectosigmoid junction. The biopsy confirmed small cell NHL. Three cycles of chemotherapy were urgently commenced over a period of 5 weeks (1 cycle of CVP; 2 cycles of CHOP). The patient showed significant symptomatic improvement. A 5-week follow-up echocardiogram showed significant shrinkage of the pericardial tumour and only a small rim of pericardial effusion. The effusion did not recollect in her follow-up echocardiograms. A year later, she was referred to the palliative care team due to the further spreading of her lymphoma. In conclusion, colorectal small cell NHL may initially present as cardiac tamponade. Urgent initiation of chemotherapy can be a treatment option whenever a drainage procedure is unsafe. Colorectal small cell NHL is a quite rare malignancy that may present initially with pericardial metastasis.Cardiac tamponade secondary to colorectal NHL is a life-threatening presentation. It can be managed by timely chemotherapy alone whenever the usual drainage procedures are not safe.A multidisciplinary approach is a cornerstone in the management of unstable lymphoma patients. It helps the rapid diagnosis and initiation of appropriate chemotherapy."

    "abstract": "Pneumothorax is not an uncommon occurrence in ICU patients. Barotrauma and iatrogenesis remain the most common causes for pneumothorax in critically ill patients. Patients with underlying lung disease are more prone to develop pneumothorax, especially if they require positive pressure ventilation. A timely diagnosis of pneumothorax is critical as it may evolve into tension physiology. Most occurrences of pneumothoraces are readily diagnosed with a chest X-ray. Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency, and managed with immediate needle decompression followed by tube thoracostomy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest remains the gold standard for diagnosis; however, getting a CT scan of the chest in a critically ill patient can be challenging. The use of thoracic ultrasound has been emerging and is proven to be superior to chest X-ray in making a diagnosis. The possibility of occult pneumothorax in patients with thoracoabdominal blunt trauma should be kept in mind. Patients with pneumothorax in the ICU should be managed with a tube thoracostomy if they are symptomatic or on mechanical ventilation. The current guidelines recommend a small-bore chest tube as the first line management of pneumothorax. In patients with persistent air leak or whose lungs do not re-expand, a thoracic surgery consultation is recommended. In non-surgical candidates, bronchoscopic interventions or autologous blood patch are other options."

    "abstract": "Identification of portal venous gas on radiographic imaging is well documented after the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, as is its resolution after hyperbaric therapy. Although hyperbaric therapy may resolve the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the presence of portal venous gas, the principle rationale for performing hyperbaric therapy is to prevent subsequent central nervous system oxygen embolization. We describe a patient with portal venous gas identified by computed tomography after the ingestion of 3% hydrogen peroxide, managed without hyperbaric therapy, who subsequently developed portal venous thrombosis. We are not aware of this complication being previously described from hydrogen peroxide ingestion. The case is complicated by the coexistence of a self-inflicted stab wound, leading to exploratory laparotomy in a patient predisposed to arterial vascular occlusion. Why Should an EmergencyPhysicianBeAware of This? Emergency physicians will encounter patients after the ingestion of hydrogen peroxide who, despite not having symptoms of central nervous system emboli, have portal venous gas identified on radiographic imaging. Being aware that the principle rationale for prophylactic utilization of hyperbaric therapy is to prevent subsequent central nervous system emboli, and that in at least one case, delayed-onset portal venous thrombosis has occurred without hyperbaric therapy may help contribute to clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "Objective: Linking emergency medical services (EMS) data to hospital outcomes is important for quality assurance and research initiatives. However, non-linkage due to missing or incomplete patient information may increase the risk of bias and distort findings. The purpose of this study was to explore if an optimization strategy, in addition to an existing linkage process, improved the linkage rate and reduced selection and information bias. Methods: 4,150 transported patients in a metropolitan EMS system in Alberta, Canada from 2016/17 were linked to two Emergency Department (ED) databases by a standard strategy using a unique health care number, date/time of ED arrival, and hospital name. An optimized strategy added additional linkage steps incorporating last name, year of birth, and a manual search. The strategies were compared to assess the rate of linkage, and to describe event and patient-level characteristics of unlinked records. Results: The standard strategy resulted in 3,650 out of 4,150 (88.0%) linked records (95% CI 86.9%-88.9%). Of the 500 non-linked records, an additional 381 were linked by the optimized strategy (n = 4,031/4,150 [97.1%; 95% CI: 96.6%-97.6%]). There were no false positive linkages. The highest linkage failure was in 25 to 34 year-old patients (n = 93/478, 19.5%), males (n = 236/1975, 12.0%), Echo level events (n = 15/77, 19.5%), and emergency transport (45/231, 19.5%). The optimized strategy improved linkage in these groups by 68.8% (64/93), 79.2% (187/236), 40.0% (6/15), and 51.1% (23/45) respectively. For dispatch card, the highest linkage failure occurred in Card 24-Pregnancy/Childbirth/Miscarriage (n = 30/44, 68.2%), Card 27-Stab/Gunshot/Penetrating Trauma (n = 6/17, 35.3%), and Card 9-Cardiac/Respiratory Arrest/Death (n = 12/46, 26.1%). The optimized strategy improved linkage by 10.0% (3/30), 83.3% (5/6), and 41.7% (5/12) respectively. For the 119 unlinked records, 71 (59.7%) had sufficient information for linkage, but no appropriately matching records could be found. Conclusion: An optimized sequential deterministic strategy linking EMS data to ED outcomes improved the linkage rate without increasing the number of false positive links, and reduced the potential for bias. Even with adequate information, some records were not linked to their ED visit. This study underscores the importance of understanding how data are linked to hospital outcomes in EMS research and the potential for bias."

A 9-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, muffled heart sounds, jugular vein distention, hemodynamic instability, and intense pallor. She had previously been followed up at the outpatient clinic for a six-month history of mild respiratory distress, polyarthritis, fever, and various cutaneous manifestations. Doppler echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion. The patient was submitted to pericardiocentesis followed by water seal pleuropericardial drainage, with no complications. The investigation continued, with fulfillment of clinical and laboratory SLE criteria plus CMV antigenemia of 15/200,000 cells. Medications to control CMV infection and SLE were then initiated, with good clinical and laboratory response. Pediatric SLE commonly manifests in a more severe form, accounting for high morbimortality. Cardiac tamponade could be one of the first manifestations of SLE, which can also be precipitated by infectious agents, such as CMV, leading to diagnostic confusion and misleading the treatment. Changes in therapeutics must also be considered in the presence of both conditions.

We hypothesized that pediatric patients with isolated blunt Grade I or II solid organ injuries may be safely discharged after brief observation with appropriate outpatient follow-up. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the need for admission of pediatric trauma patients with isolated low-grade solid organ injury resulting from blunt trauma. We performed a retrospective cohort study of trauma registry data from 2011 to 2018 to identify isolated blunt Grade I or II solid organ injuries among children younger than 19 years. \"Complication or intervention\" was defined as transfusions, transfer to the intensive care unit, repeat imaging, decrease in Hgb greater than 2 g/dl, fluid bolus after initial resuscitation, operation or interventional radiology procedure, or readmission within 1 week. A total of 51 patients were admitted to the trauma service with isolated Grade I or II blunt solid organ injuries during the 8-year study period. The average age was 11 years. Among isolated Grade I or II injuries, seven (14%) had \"complication or intervention\" including greater than 2 g/dl drop in Hgb in four patients (8%), follow-up ultrasonography for pain in one patient (2%), readmission for pain in one patient (2%), or a fluid bolus in two patients (4%). None required transfusion or surgery. The most common mechanism of injury was sports related (45%), and the average length of stay was 1 day. Among a cohort of 51 patients with isolated blunt Grade I or II solid organ injuries, none required a significant intervention justifying need for admission. All \"complication or intervention\" patients observed were of limited clinical significance. We recommend that hemodynamically stable patients with isolated low-grade solid organ injuries may be discharged from the emergency department after a brief observation along with appropriate instructions and pain management."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in children, with a peak incidence usually before the second year of age, while in neonates it is a rare entity. We describe a delayed and incidental diagnosis of neonatal intussusception secondary to Meckel's diverticulum in a neonate with shaken baby syndrome (SBS). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case of a neonatal intussusception with a Meckel's diverticulum as a lead point in a neurologically impaired child. CASE REPORT A term baby presented at 22 days of age at our Emergency Department in severe conditions due to a suspected SBS. Eight days following hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit, an isolated episode of rectal bleeding occurred, without any worsening of general conditions or abdominal distension. The ultrasonography showed a \"doughnut sign\" with high suspicion of ileocecal intussusception. A rectal barium contrast enema was performed but was not resolutive. At exploratory laparotomy an ileocecal intussusception with Meckel's diverticulum acting as a lead point was identified and an intestinal resection was needed due to the ischemic condition of the ileum. The post-operative course was uneventful and the baby recovered well; the residual neurological impairment needed long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Intussusception is a rare entity in neonates and, when severe neurological impairment is present, the diagnosis can be missed because of the compromised condition of the baby and the paucity of gastrointestinal manifestations. In addition, due to the high incidence of lead point in neonatal cases, we recommend reserving non-operative treatment only for selected cases."

Classically described frequently in tropical areas and predominantly affecting the lower limb musculature, however, in recent decades it has increasingly been associated with areas of temperate climates and relatively more frequently in immunosuppressed patients, being the patients under 30 years the most affected. Male of 15 years without relevant medical history. The patient had no history of trauma, falls, surgical interventions, infections or any other systemic condition. He came because of a clinical picture of 7 days of evolution characterized by pain referred to the groin and left iliac crest area associated with claudication and hyperthermia not quantified, which yielded partially to NSAIDs and paracetamol, but without achieving improvement so it is taken emergency by relatives. It is necessary to bear in mind this pathology when performing the differential diagnostic approach of a patient presenting with pain and functional limitation of some joint associated with data suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process. La piomiositis es un término que denota infección piógena por lo general primaria de músculo esquelético. Clásicamente descrita de manera frecuente en zonas tropicales y en pacientes inmunocomprometidos; sin embargo, en las últimas décadas se observa cada vez más en zonas de climas templados y con relativa mayor frecuencia en pacientes inmunocompetentes, siendo el grupo etario más afectado el de menores de 30 años. Masculino de 15 años sin antecedentes médicos de relevancia. Acude por presentar cuadro clínico de siete días de evolución caracterizado por dolor referido en ingle y zona de la cresta ilíaca izquierda asociado a claudicación e hipertermia no cuantificada, que cedían parcialmente a AINES y paracetamol, pero sin lograr mejoría, por lo que es llevado a urgencias por familiares. Es necesario tener en mente esta patología al momento de realizar el abordaje diagnóstico diferencial de un paciente que se presenta con dolor y limitación funcional de alguna articulación asociada a datos sugestivos de un proceso infeccioso o inflamatorio."

    "abstract": "Congenital transmesenteric hernias are uncommon and are a rare cause of bowel obstruction, which is even rarer in pregnant woman. Because of the lack of specific symptoms or reliable sensitive markers, it is difficult to diagnose internal hernia at early stage, therefore resulting in the delay of surgical intervention and a high mortality rate, especially in pregnant woman. We report a case in which a woman presenting at 16 weeks` gestation was admitted with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and left upper abdominal pain similar to her first-trimester morning sickness. Nephrolithiasis of the left kidney detected by ultrasound may lead to early incorrect diagnosis. Due to the patient`s concern about known adverse effects of ionizing radiation on the fetus, computed tomography was postponed until abdominal pain worsened, coffee color gastric contents vomited and anus stopped exhaust and defecation 12 hours later. Low dose CT plain scan showed features of small bowel obstruction by an internal hernia. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed a mesenteric defect of the left colon with a 30 cm long jejunal herniating distal to 10 cm of the ligament of Treitz. The involved small bowel was strangulated and gangrened, necrotic segmental resection and end to end anastomosis were performed subsequently, and the mesenteric defect was then successfully repaired with sutures."

    "abstract": "To analyse the feasibility, safety and procedural outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusions (CTO) through retrograde approach using single catheter. Our study was a retrospective observational study that enrolled patients who underwent retrograde CTO PCI using a single catheter between June 2016 and February 2020. Clinical success was defined as successful completion of CTO PCI without associated in-hospital major clinical complications like death, myocardial infarction, stroke or urgent revascularisation. Technical success was defined as successful completion of CTO PCI using single catheter and minimum diameter stenosis of <30% with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3, without significant side branch occlusion, flow-limiting dissection, distal embolization, or angiographic thrombus. Totally 102 patients underwent retrograde CTO PCI during the study period. Out of which, 15 cases were attempted using single catheter. Mean age of the population was 59.1 ± 8.9 years (males: 86.7%) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was (61% ± 9.1%). Mean number of diseased arteries was 2.1 ± 0.7, length of the CTO was 25.5 ± 7.4 mm and J-CTO score was 2.3 ± 0.7. We achieved a technical success rate of 73.3% using single catheter, and the overall clinical success (Including single catheter and ping pong) was obtained in 86.7% cases. One patient (6.7%) developed cardiac tamponade and none of study population required dialysis for contrast induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde CTO PCI using single catheter is a technically challenging procedure when compared with other CTO PCI. Our study demonstrated acceptable outcomes which is comparable to other antegrade and retrograde CTO PCI registries."

    "abstract": "Blunt abdominal trauma is one of the leading causes of non-obstetrics-related deaths during pregnancy, with motor vehicle collision, falls, and assaults being the most common etiologies. While a trauma team plays a central role in the care of a pregnant trauma patient, a multidisciplinary involvement is vital to ensure the safety of the fetus and the mother. This case study will follow the step-by-step multidisciplinary approach utilized for a 37-year-old female in her third trimester who suffered blunt trauma and arrived at a Level 1 trauma center that led to maternal survival but fetal demise. She was initially evaluated by Emergency Medicine and Obstetrics/Gynecology departments for maternal and fetal trauma, by Orthopedics for several fractures including the pubic ramus and sacral ala fractures, as well as by Neurosurgery for a subarachnoid hemorrhage and a subdural hematoma. Subsequently, the following departments were brought on after the patient suddenly became hypotensive with abdominal tenderness to assess for internal bleeding: Interventional Radiology, Trauma, Surgery, and Urology. Retroperitoneal and pelvic hematomas were found to be the source of bleeding during an emergency laparotomy and the decision was made for an emergency caesarian section. The neonatal intensive care unit ultimately could not start the fetal heart. In the days that followed, the neurosurgery department monitored the worsening intercranial bleeds while Psychiatry and Social Work attended to the patient. A proper systematic approach towards a patient in this situation necessitates expertise from multiple fields, and the success of this interplay greatly affects patient outcomes."

    "abstract": "Background: Small bowel injuries are infrequent after blunt trauma and typically affect fixed segment. Untimely management of such injuries, results in high-output entero-cutaneous fistula which increases morbidity and mortality. Treatment of duodeno-jejunal flexure transection has been traditionally done by pyloric exclusion with gastrojejunostomy, but more recent evidence suggests that end-to-end anastomosis or primary closure may be equally effective in which duodeno-jejunal anastomosis is protected via an external tube duodenostomy. Objective: The objective of the study is to provide a modification to the technique of management of duodeno-jejunal flexure injury, avoiding external tube duodenostomy. Material and Methods: Patients admitted from July 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 were identified and examined for duodeno-jejunal flexure transection. Non-accidental injury cases were excluded. Results: In the study period, a total of 10 patients were admitted with duodeno-jejunal flexure transection. All cases were admitted 24 hours after the injury and presented with shock. After fluid resuscitation and investigations, they were taken for urgent laparotomy. The whole of duodenum was mobilised, the transected ends were debrided and end-to-end duodenojejunal anastomosis was performed in two-layer fashion. An 18-French Nasojejunal (NJ) tube was placed beyond the anastomosis, and an 18-French nasogastric (NG) tube was placed in the stomach for gastric decompression. A feeding jejunostomy was performed in all cases. Both NG and NJ tubes were removed after bowel movements started and FJ was removed on first follow up. There was no incidence of duodenum related complications, and all were doing well on follow up. Discussion and conclusion: Placing the nasojejunal and nasogastric tube eliminates the need for duodenostomy and gastrostomy, respectively. This method protects the duodeno-jejunal anastomosis and decreases the incidence of duodenum-related complications."

    "abstract": "Penetrating trauma is commonly seen in dogs. The severity depends on the site of injury and tissue involved. Junctional hemorrhage can be especially challenging to control given the inaccessibility of the damaged vasculature. Methods described to control life-threatening hemorrhage in dogs include direct pressure, hemostatic gauze, hemostatic powder or granules, wound packing, tourniquets, and direct clamping of the vasculature. Foley balloon catheters (FBC) are commonly used to tamponade deep vascular hemorrhage in people, but the technique has not been previously described in the veterinary literature. To present a case of penetrating trauma (bite wound) in a dog with a transected left femoral artery and vein in which the life-threatening hemorrhage was initially controlled with tamponade using an FBC. A 7-year-old neutered male Terrier mix presented in hemorrhagic shock with an Animal Trauma Triage (ATT) of 7 and modifed Glasgow coma scale (MGCS) of 17 forty-five minutes after being attacked by another dog. The dog had sustained a deep penetrating wound to the left groin. Direct pressure and gauze packing at the site of injury were not successful at slowing the hemorrhage. A 10-Fr, 55-cm Foley catheter with a 5-mL balloon was inserted into the wound tract, and the balloon was inflated with 7.5 mL of sterile saline. Hemorrhage was controlled after inflation of the Foley balloon. CBC, blood biochemistries, abdominal point-of-care ultrasound, radiographs, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and whole blood viscoelastic testing were performed. Stabilization included fluid resuscitation, analgesics, antimicrobials, and epsilon aminocaproic acid. The dog was then anesthetized to definitively identify and control the hemorrhage. Transection of the left femoral artery and vein where identified and ligated. The dog fully recovered and was discharged 32 hours later. FBCs may be useful as an alternative technique for temporary control of life-threatening hemorrhage secondary to penetrating injuries in both the emergency department and prehospital settings."

    "abstract": "Correct diagnosis of pneumothorax in trauma patients is essential. Under-diagnosis can lead to development of life-threatening tension pneumothorax, but overdiagnosis leads to placement of unnecessary chest tubes with potential related morbidity and pain. It is unclear from previous work if there is a benefit to switching from the phased array (low frequency) probe to the linear (high frequency) probe. Is the improvement in image quality worth the time lost changing probes? We compared the sensitivity and specificity of a low frequency and high frequency ultrasound probe for the detection of pneumothorax. Images were obtained using swine models and were interpreted by Emergency Medicine residents, attendings, and physician assistants. We found a specificity of 89% and sensitivity of 99% for the low frequency probe and specificity of 96% and sensitivity of 99% for the high frequency probe. There was a statistically different specificity between the two probes, suggesting that the linear probe may be the superior probe for confirming the presence of pneumothorax. We conclude switching to the linear probe for the thoracic portion of the Extended-Focused Assessment in Trauma will lead to more accurate diagnosis of pneumothorax and decreased false-positive exams."

    "abstract": "Since the start of the pandemic, to date, around 180 million cases have been diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide with an estimated 3.9 million death toll. Mass vaccination has taken place to control spread of infection with the most commonly used vaccines being Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. However, the adverse events associated with vaccination have not been fully investigated. Of concern are some serious cardiovascular events such as myocarditis, pericarditis or perimyocarditis development post-vaccination. In this report, we present an unusual case of acute perimyocarditis and pericardial effusion 10 days following the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination in Qatar. At the time of presentation, the patient presented with non-specific symptoms of headache, diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy and dehydration. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. Once admitted to the emergency department, she started to deteriorate with very low blood pressure readings reaching 40/33 mmHg which was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation. After 5.5 liters of intravenous fluids, echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed. Findings were consistent with pericardial effusion, signs of impending cardiac tamponade and acute perimyocarditis. Cardiac biomarkers including troponin T and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were elevated. Hospital course was complicated with cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemodynamic instability. Eventually, the patient recovered after a three-week hospital stay and was discharged on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs). This case report highlights the hospital course and outcome linking the second dose of Moderna vaccination and the development of perimyocarditis."

    "abstract": "Trauma patients often require endotracheal intubation for urgent or emergent airway protection or to allow expeditious imaging when they cannot cooperate with the needed evaluation. These patients may occasionally be extubated in the emergency department (ED) when the trauma workup is negative for consequential injuries and eventually discharged from the ED. The timing and safety of discharging these patients is unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the adverse outcomes and evaluate the safety of extubating trauma patients who are clinically well following evaluation in the ED. Records of trauma patients who were intubated and then extubated in the ED at a single level 1 trauma referral center during the 4-year study period (Jan 2014 - Dec 2017) were retrospectively abstracted. The primary outcome was the incidence of a post-extubation complication, including desaturation, emesis, aspiration, need for sedative administration, or unplanned reintubation. Additional outcome measures included final disposition, duration of observation following extubation, ED length of stay and return to the hospital within 72 h. There were 59 eligible patients identified over the study period, of whom 95% presented following blunt trauma. One patient (1.7%; 95% confidence interval 0-9) required unplanned reintubation and developed aspiration pneumonia following re-extubation. Forty-two (71%) of the patients were discharged from the ED following extubation and a period of post-extubation observation with a mean of 5.8 h (0.6-16.7 h). None of the patients who were discharged returned to the ED within 72 h with complications related to extubation (0%; 95% confidence interval 0-6%). Patients presenting to the ED with possible acute traumatic injuries who are intubated and then extubated after trauma evaluation and resolution of the indication for intubation appear to have a low incidence of complication or return visit when discharged from the ED after a brief period of observation. Specific extubation and discharge criteria should be developed to ensure the safety of this practice. Further validation is required in the form of larger and prospective studies."

We present a unique management challenge of a critically ill patient who developed thyroid storm in the setting of a duodenal perforation from amphetamine-associated non-occlusive mesenteric ischaemia. The diagnosis of 'thyroid storm' was made based on clinical criteria and a Burch-Wartofsky score of 100. During emergent exploratory laparotomy, a 1 cm duodenal perforation with surrounding friable tissue was found and repaired. Intraoperatively, a nasogastric tube was guided distal to the area of perforation to allow for enteric administration of medications, which was critical in the setting of thyroid storm. Therapeutic plasma exchange achieved biochemical control of our patient's thyroid storm but ultimately did not prevent in-hospital mortality."

    "abstract": "Blunt injury to the abdominal aorta is a rare but potentially fatal event. Despite being much less common than thoracic aorta involvement, it carries high morbidity and mortality. Computed tomography (CT) has become the standard method for evaluating the trauma patient and can provide a rapid accurate diagnosis of aortic injury. Depending on the magnitude of the traumatic forces, aortic injuries may be present in blunt abdominal trauma and appear as a spectrum of disease ranging from small intraluminal defects to full-thickness circumferential ruptures. We classify lesions into four groups as it has been reported in the literature: intimal flap (grade I), intramural hematoma (grade II), pseudoaneurysm (grade III), and rupture (grade IV). Radiologists play a crucial role in the evaluation and care of these patients since imaging findings significantly affect clinical management. The purpose of this paper is to describe the different types of traumatic injury to the abdominal aorta, highlighting the key imaging findings on computed tomography (CT)."

His initial computed tomography scans revealed a small region of enhancement, corresponding to a small pericardial effusion, indicative of a cardiac perforation. Thus, an emergency median sternotomy was performed. He was diagnosed with perforation of the left atrial ear and right atrium, which were repaired surgically. His liver and spleen injuries were also treated, and the patient was discharged 44 days after admission.

The patient sustained one high-caliber GSW to the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, one high-caliber GSW to the left periumbilical region of the abdomen, one high caliber GSW to the fourth intercostal space of the left chest just medial to the midclavicular line with an expanding hematoma, and one high-caliber GSW to the left shoulder with a floating left shoulder. He arrived at the Emergency Department conscious with a stable pulse but quickly became hemodynamically unstable. He required a thoracotomy and exploratory laparotomy in addition to a massive transfusion protocol. This case demonstrates the reversal of a severely acidotic patient due to massive hemorrhage to a blood pH within normal limits using damage control resuscitation surgery and massive transfusion protocols. The patient has since been discharged home in a stable condition with minimal long-term sequelae."

Narrow PP in the Emergency Department (ED) has recently been shown to predict hemorrhagic shock after trauma. This study examined the impact of prehospital narrow PP on outcomes after trauma. Patients presenting to our ACS-verified Level I trauma center (2008-2020) were retrospectively screened. Exclusions were unrecorded prehospital/ED vitals, age <16 or >60, transfers, on-scene cardiac arrest, and missing discharge disposition. Prehospital blood pressure defined study groups: Narrow PP (<30 mmHg) vs. Hypotensive (SBP<90 mmHg) vs. Others (herein referred to as Normotensive). Univariable/multivariable analyses compared outcomes and determined independent predictors of mortality; resuscitative thoracotomy; emergent intervention; and need for trauma intervention (NFTI), a contemporary measure of major trauma. In total, 39,144 patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria: 5% (n=1,834) Narrow PP, 3% (n=1,062) Hypotensive, and 92% (n=36,248) Normotensive. Penetrating trauma was more frequent among Narrow PP and Hypotensive patients (23% vs. 32% vs. 14%, p<0.001). ISS was higher among Narrow PP and Hypotensive patients (5[1-14] vs. 10[2-21] vs. 4[1-9], p<0.001). Mortality was highest among the Hypotensive (n=130, 12%) followed by Narrow PP (n=92, 5%) and Normotensive patients (n=502, 1%) (p<0.001). On multivariable analysis, prehospital narrow PP was independently associated with resuscitative thoracotomy (OR 1.609, p=0.009), emergent intervention (OR 1.356, p=0.001), and NFTI (OR 1.237, p=0.009). Prehospital narrow PP independently predicts severe trauma, resuscitative thoracotomy, and emergent intervention. Although prehospital narrow PP is not currently a TTA criterion, these patients have a mortality rate and ISS intermediate to those of hypotensive and normotensive patients. Prehospital narrow PP should be recognized as a proxy for major trauma in patients with heightened surgical and interventional needs so that appropriate in-hospital preparations may be made prior to patient arrival."

We report a 75 years old male patient with diffuse abdominal tenderness 7 days after palliative ERCP stent placement for malignant biliary obstruction, metal stent could not be placed, and plastic stent placement had been done. There was no post-ERCP pancreatitis found during the first 24 h. The patient came to the emergency with clinical sign and symptoms of diffuse peritonitis; abdominal X-ray found no free intraperitoneal air. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and we found bile leak from the third part of perforated duodenal with 5 mm in diameter, plastic stent exposed from the perforation site, and no active bleeding. We performed primary suture of the duodenum, cholecysto-enteric bypass, pyloric exclusion, gastro-jejunostomy bypass, and braun anastomosis. Jejunostomy feeding has been placed. There were no postoperative cardiopulmonary complication, and the patient could tolerate well for oral intake and discharged from hospital at 10th postoperative day (POD).

Secondary outcomes were the association of individual patient- and injury characteristics with the requirement for HEMS interventions. During the study period 363 patients met inclusion criteria. 90% of patients were male with a median age of 30 years. 99% of penetrating trauma incident occurred more than 10-min drive from a Major Trauma Centre (MTC). Presenting GCS was > 13 in 83% of patients. Significant hemodynamic- or ventilatory compromise was present in more than 25% of the patients. Traumatic cardiac arrest was present in 34 patients (9.4%), profound hypotension with SBP < 80 mmHg in 30 (8.3%) and oxygen saturations < 92% in 30 (8.3%). A total of 121 HEMS-specific interventions were performed. Although HEMS-specific interventions were associated with presenting physiology (TCA OR 1.75 [1.41-2.16], SBP < 80 mmHg (OR 1.40 [1.18-1.67] and SpO2 < 92% (OR 1.39 [1.17-1.65], a minority of the patients presented initially with stable physiology but deteriorated on route to hospital and required HEMS interventions (n = 9, 3.3%). HEMS teams provide potentially important contribution to the pre-hospital treatment of patients with penetrating torso injuries in rural and semi-rural areas, especially when they present with unstable physiology. A certain degree of over-triage is inevitable in these patients, as it is hard to predict which patients will deteriorate on route to hospital and will need HEMS interventions. The results of this study showing a potentially predictable geographical dispersion of penetrating trauma could inform multi-agency knife crime prevention strategy."

    "title": "Jejunal Volvulus Around Gastrostomy Tube: An Exceptional Complication in Cerebral Palsy.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Cerebral palsy may be accompanied by gastrointestinal disorders. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is an increasingly performed procedure in these patients. While PEG tube feeding can result in weight gain and a decrease in aspiration episodes, this insertion of a PEG tube is not without complications. Specifically, intestinal volvulus following PEG tube insertion is an exceedingly rare complication. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old man with cerebral palsy was brought to the emergency department with a history of recurrent vomiting. He had a history of PEG tube insertion 2 months prior to his presentation. The physical examination was non-contributory. Abdominal computed tomography was suggestive of an intestinal volvulus around the PEG tube. Subsequently, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, which confirmed the diagnosis and enabled successful management. Unexpectedly, the patient suffered cardiac arrest 5 days following the operation. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed with pharmacological intervention and defibrillation in accordance with the advanced cardiac life support guidelines. He recovered successfully and was discharged after a 4-day observation. CONCLUSIONS Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for small bowel volvulus in patients who had a PEG tube inserted, along with intestinal obstruction. Furthermore, caregivers should be educated to recognize the early signs of intestinal obstruction and seek medical attention, since a delay can result in fatal outcomes."

    "title": "Successful limb salvage beyond the golden time following blunt traumatic open complete transection of the femoral artery and vein in a patient with cardiac arrest: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Open complete transection of the femoral artery and vein following blunt trauma is extremely rare. Furthermore, even if the patient has been successfully resuscitated, it is sometimes difficult in most patients to preserve the injured limb, especially after damage control resuscitation. We report a case of open complete transection of the femoral artery and vein secondary to high-energy blunt trauma and a successful limb preservation treatment strategy. A 57-year-old Asian man was transferred to hospital after having fallen from the 15th floor of a condominium. The patient was in cardiac arrest at the scene, but was successfully resuscitated by emergency medical services staff. On arrival, the patient's hemodynamics were completely collapsed with active external bleeding from the thigh, so we immediately started resuscitation including activation of massive transfusion protocol and temporarily ligated the transected proximal superficial femoral artery, deep femoral artery just distal after branching lateral femoral circumflex artery and the superficial femoral vein. Following radiological findings showing a potential pelvic fracture with active bleeding, we also performed retroperitoneal packing in the resuscitation room and moved the patient to the angiography room for transcatheter arterial embolization. The patient's consciousness was preserved and perfusion of the injured limb was barely maintained after his hemodynamics were adequately stabilized. As we detected weak perfusion of the lower limb via a potential collateral flow from the lateral femoral circumflex artery branches from deep femoral artery by pulse doppler of the dorsal pedis artery, we decided to reconstruct superficial femoral artery and vein at 24 h after injury using great saphenous vein bypass grafts. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital with good neurological and limb outcome after hospitalization for 52 days. We successfully preserved the patient's lower limb after cardiac arrest and complete transection of the femoral artery and vein and achieved a good neurological outcome. Even if a femoral artery needs to be ligated temporarily, careful observation and assessment should be performed so as not to lose the chance to salvage the limb even during damage control resuscitation."

    "title": "Role of Emergent Nephrectomy for Grade V Blunt Renal Injuries.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Blunt renal injuries constitute a small proportion of solid organ trauma cases. Many American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade IV and V lacerations are manageable with volume resuscitation and angioembolization. In select cases, emergent nephrectomy can be beneficial to patients, with little associated morbidity. CASE REPORT In 2 separate cases, an 18-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman were brought to our center after sustaining blunt trauma to the left flank. They were both found to have isolated grade V renal lacerations with vascular compromise. Both initially had normal vital signs but became unstable. Active extravasation was visible on contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, and the patients ultimately underwent exploratory laparotomy and nephrectomy on hospital day 1. Both of them recovered quickly, had no acute complications, and were discharged in <1 week. Follow-up over the course of 1 year showed no untoward sequelae. CONCLUSIONS These cases highlight the role of nephrectomy to mitigate life-threatening hemorrhage in unstable patients. While observation or angioembolization is the preferred approach for many renal injuries, emergent nephrectomy remains important for patients who do not respond to blood products and have rapidly deteriorating shock. In these patients, results of an initial trauma evaluation can be unclear because of concomitant splenic injury, as well as renal injuries with hemoperitoneum that are visible on focused abdominal ultrasonography for trauma. When forgoing immediate laparotomy, surgeons can use continuous noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring along with serial hemoglobin measurements and abdominal examinations. Laparotomy with nephrectomy results in limited morbidity when it is done expeditiously with ongoing volume resuscitation."

    "abstract": "In this study, two cases that demonstrate the importance of bedside echocardiography and hands-off telemedicine technology for diagnosis and intervention in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are discussed. We report two cases of cardiac emergency associated with COVID-19. Case 1 is a 50-year-old female patient with chronic hypertension and chronic renal failure. Case 2 is a 64-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and recent stroke. Both were admitted to an isolation intensive care unit that was designated specifically to patients with COVID-19. During admission, both patients had sudden deterioration characterized by oxygen desaturation and hypotension necessitating inotropic support. As a result, for both patients, bedside echocardiography was performed by the attending intensivist. Echocardiographic findings showed cardiac tamponade and acute pulmonary embolism, respectively, which were confirmed by a cardiologist through telemedicine technology. Proper emergency management was initiated, and both patients recovered well. Limited bedside transthoracic echocardiography had a front-line impact on the treatment and outcome of the two patients with COVID-19. By implementing telemedicine technology, the lives of two patients were saved, demonstrating the significance of telemedicine in isolation intensive care units in the developing countries during the COVID-19 pandemic."

    "title": "The Critical Intervention Screen: A Novel Tool to Determine the Use of Lights and Sirens during the Transport of Trauma Patients.",
    "abstract": "Objective: EMS use of lights and sirens has long been employed in EMS systems, despite an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions associated with their use. The specific aims of this study were to assess the current use of lights and sirens during the transport of trauma patients in a busy metropolitan area and to subsequently develop a novel tool, the Critical Intervention Screen, to aid EMS professionals tasked with making transport decisions in the presence of acute injury.Methods: This single-center, retrospective study included all patients transported to an academic Level One trauma center by ground ambulance from the scene of presumed or known injury. A subset of patients was identified as being most likely to benefit from shorter transport times if they received one of the following critical interventions within 20 minutes of emergency department arrival: intubation, thoracotomy, chest tube, blood products, central line, arterial line, REBOA, disposition to an operating room, or death. Stepwise logistic regression was employed for the development of the Critical Intervention Screen, with a subset of data retained for internal validation.Results: 1296 patients were available for analysis. Overall, 217 patients (16.7%) received a critical intervention, and 112 patients (8.6%) of those patients received a critical intervention within 20 minutes of emergency department arrival. At baseline, EMS use of lights and sirens was 91.1% sensitive and 80.3% specific for receiving a critical intervention. Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that the need for assisted ventilation, GCS Motor < 6, and penetrating trauma to the trunk were the most predictive prehospital data for receiving at least one critical intervention. The Critical Intervention Screen, defined as having at least one of these risk factors in the prehospital setting, modestly increased sensitivity and specificity (96.4% and 87.9%, respectively) predicting the need for a critical intervention.Conclusion: These findings indicate that EMS are able to correctly identify high-acuity trauma patients, but at times employ L&S during the transport of patients with a low likelihood of receiving a time-sensitive intervention upon emergency department arrival. Therefore, the Critical Intervention Screen has the potential to reduce the use of lights and sirens and improve EMS safety."

    "title": "Blunt splenic trauma 2.0. State of the art.",
    "abstract": "To evaluate the advantages and potential risks of \"Non Operative Management\" (NOM) in order to redifine the technique into the true gold standard and to extend its application to the emergency care of blunt splenic trauma. Blunt trauma cases treated between 2004 and 2019 have been retrospectively evaluated. Every patient has been distributed at the hospital admission in 3 different groups: stable, unstable and transient responder according to ATLS. NOM exclusion criteria were only introduced in 2013: we therefore assessed datas before and after this year. Over a period of 15 years, approximately 6 patients per year were admitted to our hospital with a spleen injury. After the introduction of the NOM protocol in 2013, the proportion of splenectomies progressively decreased. This rate also increased for higher injury grades. The overall number of patients who underwent NOM was 40 (43%), but while between 2004 and 2012 only 25% of patients were managed with NOM, between 2013 and 2019 70.3% of patients were treated with NOM. Nowadays any blunt splenic trauma could, theoretically, undergo NOM, regardless of the grade of the injury; the only strict criteria for OM should be haemodynamic instability; this assumption depends, of course, on hospital's human and technological resources. Non operative management, Splenic trauma, Splenectomy. Studiare i vantaggi e i potenziali rischi dell’utilizzo del trattamento non operativo dei traumi splenici, allo scopo di dimostrare la possibilità di tale tecnica di diventare il “gold standard” da applicare nel setting di emergenza in pronto soccorso e successivamente in ambiente chirurgico in caso di traumi splenici non penetranti. Sono stati valutati retrospettivamente i traumi splenici trattati presso la chirurgia dell’ospedale di Ivrea nel periodo compreso tra il 2004 ed il 2019. Ogni caso è stato classificato all’ammissione presso il dipartimento di emergenza ed accettazione in base alla stabilità del paziente, distinguendo pazienti stabili, instabili e pazienti instabili ma responsivi al trattamento medico; la suddivisione è stata fatta tenendo conto delle linee guida ATLS. Essendo i criteri di esclusione al trattamento non operativo stati pubblicati solamente nel 2013, i dati in nostro possesso sono stati valutati suddividendoli in due tranches a cavallo di tale data. Durante un periodo di 15 anni, circa 6 pazienti per anno sono stati valutati nel nostro pronto soccorso a seguito di un danno splenico. A seguito dell’introduzione del protocollo di gestione non operativa del trauma splenico nel 2013, la proporzione di interventi chirurgici di splenectomia sono andati progressivamente diminuendo, perfino in caso di alti gradi di danno splenico post traumatico. Il numero totale di pazienti sottoposti a trattamento non chirurgico è stato di 40 (circa il 43%) del totale; tenendo invece conto del solo periodo successivo al 2013, il valore totale aumenta a circa il 70%, dato in linea con la letteratura internazionale attuale. Al giorno d’oggi qualunque trauma splenico potrebbe essere, teoricamente, essere sottoposto a trattamento conservativo non chirurgico, indipendentemente dal grado della lesione splenica. L’unica controindicazione stretta al trattamento non operativo risulta infatti essere l’instabilità emodinamica del paziente traumatizzato. La scelta del trattamento non può però ovviamente prescindere dalle risorse umane e tecnologiche dell’ospedale in cui ci si trova a gestire il malato."

    "abstract": "Jejunal diverticula are the rarest of all small bowel diverticula and usually have no classic clinical symptoms. Jejunal diverticular haemorrhage (JDH) is a rare complication and can be difficult to identify and manage, hence it always resulting in a diagnostic delay and unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. Although with the advances in endoscopic technology, no consensus have been reached on the diagnosis and management of JDH, the conventional surgical intervention still remains the mainstream for the management of JDH. We report an unique case of a 63-year-old male who presented with massive haemorrhage from jejunal diverticula, which was successfully managed by initial resuscitation and definitive surgery. A 63-year-old male was admitted as an emergency with 6 h history of haematemesis and melena. The haematemesis appeared to be bright red, with volume exceeding 100 mL. The amount of melena was estimated to be 200 mL. Initially, the patient received fluid resuscitation and three unit blood transfusion. Then, in order to localize the bleeding sites, colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and mesenteric angiography were utilized but failed to identify the source of haemorrhage. Informed consent form was obtained for further treatment, and he was treated with an exploratory laparotomy and the bleeding site was successfully located during the procedure. He was diagnosed with JDH. The postoperative period was uneventful, and he was discharged on day 18 after surgery. No rebleeding occurred at the 1-year follow-up. In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, if various techniques fail to identify the cause of haemorrhage in small bowel and haemodynamic instability is sustained with continuous resuscitation, we recommend surgical intervention should be the ultimate treatment of choice."
